            "text": "Nigerian neobank, Kuda, obtained a licence from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to run a digital bank in the country on Friday, January 13, 2023. The neobank, under the name KT Bank, was one of five banks to receive a licence from the SBP. The other banks include Easy Paisa DB, Hugo Bank, Mashreq Bank, and Raqami.\n\nIn 2015, the SBP launched a national financial inclusion strategy to increase the number of financially included Pakistanis to 50% of the country\u2019s adult population by 2020. It has not achieved that goal, with only 21% of Pakistanis financially included. Its financial inclusion record is even worse when considering gender, as 36% of male adults in the country are in the financial system compared to 7% of women.\n\nWhile the country has made slow progress in its financial inclusion journey, smartphone and Internet penetration has risen. In 2022, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority reported that smartphone users (52%) now outnumber users of 2G-enabled phones (48%) for the first time. Broadband subscribers in the country also reached 102.7 million in 2021, while the number of active mobile wallets has increased from 26.7 million in 2020 to 46 million in 2021.\n\nPerhaps building on this, the SBP introduced a new regulatory and licensing framework for the country in January 2022, receiving 20 applications by March 2022. It has now granted a licence to the five banks, including Kuda, which are expected to incorporate a public limited company with Pakistan\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission. An in-principle approval is expected to be granted, after which they can commence operations in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2022, Kuda announced that it was beginning operations in the United Kingdom, where large numbers of African immigrants reside, providing them with local transfers and direct debits. At the time, Babs Ogundeyi, the startup\u2019s CEO, explained that Kuda was building a one-stop-shop for Africans, with the UK being the first of its outside-of-Africa destinations. While its Pakistan move does not appear to fall under this plan, Pakistan is ripe for a digital banking disruption, and the startup possibly fancies its chances of competing in the nascent space.",

The company, which has 11 employees, will initially focus on research and development and expects to create 60 new jobs at an average wage of $80,433.\n\n\u201cColorado is the epicenter of the aerospace industry, and we are excited to welcome ThinkOrbital to Colorado, bringing 60 new good-paying jobs to Coloradans and joining our innovative and collaborative aerospace community,\u201d Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.\n\nColorado\u2019s aerospace industry is the second-largest in the country, behind California\u2019s. A report by the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation and the Colorado Space Coalition said there are 290 aerospace companies in the state and more than 500 companies that provide space-related products and services.\n\nThe report said employment in the aerospace industry grew 11.2% from 2019 to 2020 in the nine-county Denver area and northern Colorado and grew 30.1% from 2015 to 2020.\n\nThe growth was one of the key factors in ThinkOrbital\u2019s decision to locate its headquarters in Colorado, according to state officials. The company also cited the area\u2019s highly educated and skilled workforce.\n\nThinkOrbital is developing platforms that can be deployed in a single launch and assembled autonomously in orbit. The structures could be used for in-space manufacturing, to serve satellites, process and store space debris and for military missions.\n\n\u201cOur ThinkPlatform can scale up to deliver 4,000 cubic meters of internal volume in space through a single launch, four times the volume of the International Space Station,\u201d retired Air Force Col. Lee Rosen, company co-founder, president and chief strategy officer, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cColorado presents a great opportunity to build and test our technologies on Earth, with access to a great talent pool, a rapidly growing new space industry and several U.S. Space Force installations,\u201d added Rosen, a former SpaceX vice president and U.S. Air Force Academy graduate.\n\nColorado companies are at the forefront of efforts to commercialize space, said Eve Lieberman, executive director of the state Office of Economic Development and International Trade.\n\nCompanies are increasingly interested in taking advantage of the properties of low Earth orbit. The conditions can enable easier manipulation of materials, speed up development cycles and aid research on cures for diseases because cell cultures grow differently.\n\nThinkOrbital received two U.S. Space Force Orbital Prime contracts in 2022. The contracts are for developing technology to clean up space debris and other space services. The company is subleasing space in Lafayette and is considering permanent sites in the Denver and Boulder areas.\n\nGet more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.",

            "text": "New company hopes to renovate former Carolina Box Co. bldg. on Fonville Street\n\nBurlington\u2019s city council has unanimously agreed to sponsor an application for a state-level grant to help a small stone-working startup carve out some new digs in a vacant industrial facility on the city\u2019s north side.\n\nDuring a regularly-scheduled meeting on Tuesday, the council voted 5-to-0 to seek a building reuse grant from the N.C. Department of Commerce on behalf of a locally-based limited liability corporation called Armen Stone.\n\nA relatively young enterprise that manufactures stone countertops for building contractors, Armen hopes to use the proceeds from this state grant to renovate a now-desolate facility at 322 Fonville Street that was formerly home to the Carolina Box Company.\n\nAccording to Burlington\u2019s economic developer Peter Bishop, this plant\u2019s previous occupant had used this facility \u201cto make fancy boxes for special awards and the like.\u201d Bishop told the council that Armen would now like to repurpose the old box factory, which is situated off of North Church Street, several blocks north of the city\u2019s downtown business district.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBishop added that the company is prepared to spend $3 million to purchase and renovate this 65,541-square-foot edifice \u2013 where, over the course of two years, it intends to quarter 33 employees with an average anticipated salary of $52,000 a year.\n\nIn order to help Armen consummate its vision, Bishop proposed that the city apply for a building reuse grant from the state\u2019s commerce department.\n\nBishop added that the grant\u2019s administrators have \u201cpreliminarily approved\u201d a total award of $200,000 for this project. Bishop noted that the city would be liable for 5 percent of the grant\u2019s total value \u2013 which would equate to $10,000 if the grant\u2019s tentative value is later confirmed.\n\nBishop assured the council that, in addition to the commerce department\u2019s potential largesse, Armen has remarkably bright financial prospects for such a fledgling enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe company has already secured an SBA loan through Fidelity Bank and also a revolving line of credit,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good start as a startup company to have a bank that believes in you\u2026and certainly everything that we have researched about the company has checked out.\u201d\n\nShould Armen obtain the requested funds from the commerce department, it will join a handful of other local firms that have previously benefited from the state\u2019s building reuse program.\n\nBishop recalled that, since 2019, the recipients of this grant have pumped $10 million into Burlington\u2019s tax base and added upward of 173 new employees to the local workforce. He went on to recount some of the grant\u2019s individual alums, including Flexaust, an industrial hose manufacturer with a facility along Tucker Street; and NOA Living, a designer and manufacturer of luxury home goods that has inhabited a long dormant textile mill along Lakeside Avenue.\n\nBishop also alluded to National OnDemand, a specialist in telecom infrastructure that has renovated two buildings within the city\u2019s downtown business district; and ChenMed, a medical office chain that has resuscitated a former pharmacy building along Harden Street.\n\n\u201cThis will hopefully be another one in line with those,\u201d Bishop went on to add of Armen Stone.\n\n\u201cThis is very critical capital for a challenging property, and we\u2019re happy to have this fit.\u201d\n\nThe council went on to approve the grant application by a margin of 5-to-0.",

            "text": "Sumitomo Corporation has concluded a global exclusive distribution agreement in the non-ferrous metals field with Security Matters (hereinafter, 'SMX'), an Israeli start-up company with proprietary technology that can put specific markers on materials at the molecular level.\n\nThrough sales and marketing of the company's products, which can track raw materials and products along the supply chain, Sumitomo Corporation will contribute to supply chain transparency and the realization of a recycling-oriented society.\n\nCompanies Increasingly Move Toward Sustainable Procurement and Supply Chain Transparency\n\nIn recent years, the world has become increasingly aware of the need for 'sustainable procurement of raw materials. Companies need to procure raw materials to make their products, and this process can create not only quality shortages but also various environmental and social challenges, such as resource depletion, child labor, and land overexploitation. The failure to address those challenges in the supply chain also poses the risk of damaging corporate value.\n\nUnder these circumstances, there is a growing trend around the world to emphasize product traceability (tracking of production history) and to make supply chains more visible and transparent. This visualization of production history enables us to prove that procured products are environmentally and socially conscious, to provide safe and secure products to customers, and to disclose more accurate information to stakeholders.\n\nSMX's Proprietary Technology Deals with the Supply Chain of Metal Resources\n\nSMX is a startup founded in Israel in 2015 with a revolutionary technology that enables centralized management of information throughout the supply chain by assigning individual IDs to substances and managing them on a blockchain. Because of their unique patents that allow them to assign a marker to a substance at the molecular level, they can handle all substances, regardless of their state (gas, liquid, or solid). In addition, there is no falsification of information by third parties with the use of blockchain.\n\nIn the midst of the demand for supply chain transparency, it has been said that it is difficult to accurately grasp and manage the movement of raw materials because the shape of metal resources changes in the process of productization. However, by using SMX technology, which can be applied at the molecular level, it is possible to make the supply chain of metal resources transparent because the markers can function even if the shape of the material changes through processing. Even though the production process of metal resources involves the risk of human rights issues for miners and environmental impacts due to overexploitation, it is possible to identify and prove the source of raw materials and sell safer and more competitive products to customers by using SMX products.\n\nContributing to the Realization of a Sustainable Society through Collaboration with SMX\n\nSumitomo Corporation has concluded an exclusive agency agreement with SMX in the field of non-ferrous metals and will conduct sales and marketing of the company's products. Specifically, we will develop our business in which the production process in the supply chain is monitored and managed by marking ores and products used as raw materials for non-ferrous metals with SMX products. In addition to being a distributor of SMX products, we will also apply SMX technology to the metal resources we handle, such as traceability of nickel and cobalt used in battery metal for EVs and visualization of scrap ratios in copper, in order to differentiate our products, thereby improving the profitability and competitiveness of our business.\n\nFounder and CEO of Security Matters : Mr. Haggai Alon\n\nAbout Security Matters\n\nCEO : Haggai Alon\n\nHeadquarter : Israel\n\nFounded : 2015\n\nBusiness : Development of supply chain visualization technology",

            "text": "Cracking Australia. It\u2019s often a long-held dream for New Zealand businesses.\n\nBut for one Hawke\u2019s Bay natural baby food startup, Norish, selling across the Tasman has always been in the plan - and less than two years after it was founded, about 15% of sales come from Australia.\n\nNorish was founded in April 2021 by nutritionist and former nurse Gina Urlich.\n\nThe New Zealand mother-of-four took $200,000 of family funds and used that to bootstrap the research and development needed to create a line of natural, freeze-dried and nutritional baby products that at first glance might appear to have more in common with the food served to astronauts.\n\nNorish baby food comes as a powder, with parents adding water to the mix to turn it back into \u201cwhole food form\u201d.\n\nBecause the products are freeze-dried powders, they are shelf stable and retain and even concentrate the nutrients from the ingredients, Urlich says.\n\nUrlich says some mainstream baby foods such as the popular pouches of pureed baby food you see in the supermarket go through \u201cextreme heating\u201d to make sure they are sterile and safe, but this process destroys water-soluble vitamins and essential nutrients, which are then put back into the product as additives.\n\nA typical Norish blend might contain quinoa powder, carrot, cauliflower or another vegetable blend, grass fed beef bone broth and other dense foods like spirulina or kelp.\n\n\u201cWhen I started developing the recipes, I really leant into those foods with concentrated nutrients, and then also bioavailable nutrients - ones that are really easy for a baby to digest. These are quite different from the kind of conventional food that we see in the baby food market. Things like liver and bone broth quinoa, and all those fruits and vegetables as well. But pairing them together to enhance that bioavailability and absorption of those nutrients as well.\u201d\n\nUrlich says the freeze drying of the ingredients in the Norish products is a critical part of its manufacturing process and what makes the baby food nutrient dense.\n\n\u201cWe knew when we were launching the product it was going to be legitimising that new concept of a baby food. It was really kind of testing the waters, but it's been so well received. The convenience of people taking [the baby food powder] on an aeroplane, and everyone travelling, it's just been so popular for holidays, or those kind of long haul flights or if they're going camping.\u201d\n\nFrom founding the firm in April 2021, Urlich had a product to market a year later.\n\nThe startup is using an Auckland manufacturing facility but the firm is based in Hawke\u2019s Bay where Urlich lives.\n\nUrlich says getting the business up and running has \u201cbeen a bit of a whirlwind\u201d, but change in the baby food market has been slow.\n\n\u201cI think in the 15 years since having my first child nothing's really changed. Probably the most innovative change that we've seen in baby food has been like the pouch and baby sucking it out of the pouch, more than the food or the ingredients. So it was long overdue for something to come on the market and, and really offer some nutrients at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe firm is focusing on e-commerce, selling primarily through its website and selected health stores like Health Post. Urlich says it\u2019s already selling well in New Zealand and Australia, with about 15% of sales coming from Australia.\n\nEvery month Urlich says the company has to increase the size of their product run, and believes there is an opportunity for Norish to supply products in other markets as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly blown away by how much product we are going through.\u201d\n\nUrlich\u2019s existing business, and social media profile, also played a part in boosting Norish.\n\nUrlich has had a successful nutrition business that focuses on women's health and infant nutrition, and she has more than 33,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nThanks to a star appearance at startup accelerator Innovate Hawke\u2019s Bay, the company attracted investment in 2022 from Fingermark technology firm founder Luke Irving and one of the sons of the Ezibuy-founding Gillespie family, Tim Gillespie.\n\n\u201cThe investors that have come on board with us offer the opportunity for us to open up to new markets like Australia, but then also their experience and their advice around strategy and in growing as well has been hugely beneficial. Sometimes as a startup and an entrepreneur, it can feel quite lonely and quite isolating. So for me, it's been just such a relief to have an advisory board and a team of experienced people to lean on when we need to make decisions or ask a question or even celebrate the wins.\u201d",

The Medford Mail Tribune abruptly closed in mid-January.\n\n\u201cThis looked like an opportunity from the standpoint of a business opportunity that we can build a sustainable model there and also serve the community with journalism,\u201d said Heidi Wright, COO and publisher of EO Media Group.\n\nAccording to Wright, they plan to hire a newsroom of 14 people, including seven reporters. While they plan to eventually have a three day per week print edition, the paper will begin online only, according to Bend Bulletin Editor Gerry O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cEO Media Group, being an Oregon-based media group, saw this as a prime opportunity to alleviate what they call the news deserts that are happening around the state. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going into this with both feet,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see us try to expand into other news deserts, as they say \u2014 small town operations that don\u2019t have a website or reporters.\u201d\n\nThe Medford Mail Tribune was the largest newspaper serving the Rogue Valley. Since it closed, another independent newspaper, the Grants Pass Daily Courier, has also said it will expand into Medford. It has hired several former Mail Tribune reporters.\n\nEO Media Group has also been in talks with Ashland-based online news site Ashland.news about sharing content. According to O\u2019Brien, their partnership will allow Ashland.news to be printed once per week.\n\nEO Media Group purchased the Bend Bulletin in 2019 after its parent company, Western Communications, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood was that it would be taken over by one of these venture capital-backed organizations that would strip out all the local reporters, start running wire service stories and turn it into the USA Today of Bend,\u201d said Louis Capozzi, a Bend resident.\n\nCapozzi and four other Bend residents helped raise $1 million for EO Media Group to outbid competitors and purchase the Bulletin. After that, he said, Wright and O\u2019Brien helped turn the paper around.\n\n\u201cThey got it financially stable, they got the editorial content to be way better, they had a much more balanced editorial policy and the news side got stronger and more relevant to our community, so it was a terrific win,\u201d Capozzi said.\n\nCapozzi is also a board member of the nonprofit Fund for Oregon Rural Journalism, which he said was started after the Bulletin was purchased to develop priorities for how to strengthen struggling rural newspapers across Oregon, including talent development, monetization, and ways to keep publications relevant.\n\nAccording to Wright, creating a startup news organization in Medford will be funded by their company and through advertising support.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve observed and have communicated with a number of people, I think we will have the support we need to build a sustainable business model,\u201d she said.",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 20 (Reuters) - A price war in electric vehicles started by market leader Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has made it much more difficult for money-losing U.S. startups like Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN.O) and Lucid Group Inc (LCID.O) to grab share in an industry competing for shrinking consumer wallets.\n\nTesla's move last week to slash prices globally on its EVs by as much as 20% could draw new buyers to electric cars in the industry, but also will force other automakers to respond with lower prices or risk getting left behind, analysts and investors said.\n\nSome startups may not be able to afford lower prices as they struggle with staggering raw material and production costs combined with far lower output than the Elon Musk-led Tesla, which delivered more than 1.3 million vehicles last year.\n\nTesla's move will \"strengthen their ... competitive advantage over other automakers,\" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said.\n\nThe struggles of most startups are a far cry from their initial public offerings over the past few years, when investors believed these companies would take over the EV market and echo the heady valuation Tesla has sported in the past.\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' FOR EV STARTUPS\n\nBoth Rivian and Lucid have yet to turn a profit. Together they delivered more than 24,000 cars last year, with Rivian spending more money on making each car than the selling price of that vehicle.\n\nThe company's cost of goods sold was about 2.7 times its revenue in the last reported quarter, while Lucid's cost of revenue was about 2.5 times its sales.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nStill, Rivian had $13.8 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter - the most among the U.S. EV startups. Lucid had the second-highest cash reserves with $1.26 billion, and it raised another $1.52 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat gives the companies a sizeable production runway at a time peers Faraday Future (FFIE.O) and British EV startup Arrival have been seeking funding and have warned they might not be able to sustain operations through 2023.\n\n\"It's a 'Game of Thrones' battle for EV startups and they face some dire options over the next 12 to 18 months if they do not succeed in their financial targets,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. \"We would expect some ... losers that face the prospect of consolidation or possibly worse on the horizon.\"\n\nA clearer picture of their balance sheets is expected when these companies report fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nRivian declined to comment, while Lucid did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLucid aims to target the luxury and sport-luxury sedan segment of the EV market, with its cars starting at over $87,000, which is $8,000 less than the base version of Tesla's Model S sedan after the January discounts.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nLucid, headed by former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson, has not announced plans for a mass-market car to rival Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, which start at about $44,000 and $53,000, respectively.\n\nRivian sells its R1T pickup truck at a starting price of $73,000 while its R1S SUV starts at $78,000.\n\nThe company, whose largest shareholder is Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), does not plan on selling cheaper cars that it will build on a next-generation R2 platform before 2026. The platform will support higher volumes and be less expensive than the vehicles built on the R1 platform, Rivian says.\n\nTesla's price cuts come just months after contract manufacturer Magna Steyr began production of Fisker's (FSR.N) Ocean SUV, which starts at $37,499 and makes it more vulnerable, analysts said.\n\nFisker declined to comment.\n\nLordstown Motors (RIDE.O), which in May sold a significant chunk of its assets to contract manufacturer Foxconn (2317.TW) to raise funds, said its Endurance pickup targets the commercial fleet market only.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nReporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Writing by Aditya Soni Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "text": "The number of Japan\u2019s corporate venture capital (CVC) funds, which invest corporate funds directly in external startup companies, and amount of their investments have risen markedly in recent years. This is especially true in areas of digital transformation (DX) and climate change.\n\nMembership in the Japan Venture Capital Association has more than quadrupled over the last decade. A recent report attributes this growth to various structural developments. For one thing, independent VCs have really broken out in Japan, with \u201cthe mark of a maturing startup ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe virtuous cycle needed for this expansion is clear: More VC investments are fueling greater startup successes and leading to improved VC returns, which attracts more capital and talent. The result? VC is becoming ensconced as an asset class, and that accelerates the positive feedback loop.\n\nINVESTMENT STRUCTURE\n\nThere are three key investment structures to consider for CVC funds, and each yields a different type of risk mitigation:\n\nDirect investment from Japan: Does not require the burden of fund formation, but there is a risk that Japanese investors might be directly involved in disputes in the United States (especially startup-related disputes). There is also the blocker entity, which insulates Japanese investors from US taxation and audit risks.\n\nDoes not require the burden of fund formation, but there is a risk that Japanese investors might be directly involved in disputes in the United States (especially startup-related disputes). There is also the blocker entity, which insulates Japanese investors from US taxation and audit risks. Investment through US corporate fund: Although investments through a US corporate fund can reduce the risk of Japanese investors being directly involved in disputes in the United States, the fund is treated as a corporation for US tax purposes. In addition, dividends a US corporate fund receives from its portfolio companies are subject to federal corporate income tax.\n\nAlthough investments through a US corporate fund can reduce the risk of Japanese investors being directly involved in disputes in the United States, the fund is treated as a corporation for US tax purposes. In addition, dividends a US corporate fund receives from its portfolio companies are subject to federal corporate income tax. Investment through US LP fund: Limited partnership (LP) fund structures can enable Japanese investors to reduce the risk of being directly involved in disputes in the United States while enjoying tax benefits from pass-through taxation. An LP fund is treated as a partnership for US tax purposes and is not subject to federal corporate income tax on dividends received from its portfolio companies.\n\nFUND FORMATION PROCEDURES\n\nIn Japan, there are necessary steps to set up a fund. The first step is the incorporation of a blocker entity, which can insulate Japanese investors from US taxation and audit risks, and further reduces the risk of liability exposure in connection with US investments. Tax-exempt individuals in the United States and some foreign investors have used such instruments when participating in private equity or investing in hedge funds.\n\nThe next step is to complete a notification of qualified institutional investor and notification of specially permitted business for qualified institutional investors, etc. in Japan, prior to the execution of a limited partnership agreement and subscription agreement by a Japanese investor.\n\nOn the US side, the State of Delaware is the preferred jurisdiction for fund formation. Delaware corporate law reflects the latest US business developments and contains provisions limiting directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 personal liability and extends indemnification, making it easier to attract talented people. The Delaware Court of Chancery specializes in corporate practice and has a high degree of business predictability, thanks to dispute resolution by professional judges and the large number of precedents.\n\nNote that this venue also signals prestige, as the majority of US publicly traded companies and more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in the state. At a practical level, Delaware offers prompter processing by authorities compared to other states. As for privacy concerns, Delaware filings do not require much personal identifying information, thereby mitigating the risk of disclosure liability.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS ON FUND FORMATION\n\nPrior to the execution of a limited partnership agreement and subscription agreement by a Japanese investor, it is necessary to complete the notification of qualified institutional investor and notification of specially permitted business for qualified institutional investors, etc. in Japan.\n\nThe State of Delaware is preferred for the formation of fund managers and LP funds in the United States.\n\nIn addition to corporate filings related to fund formation, filings with the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and filings under the US Securities Act also need to be considered.\n\nLearn More\n\nFor more details on CVC investment fund issues, please see our full presentation, Corporate Venture Capital Investments in US Startups (Part 1): Fund Formation and Investment Structure s (conducted in Japanese). This event is part of our 2023 series designed for Japanese companies and funds developing new business models through investment in US startup companies.\n\n[View source.]",

            "summary": "\n\n Japan is seeing a jump in corporate venture capital funds, which invest corporate funds directly into external startup companies. This growth can be attributed to the increasing number of independent VCs and the mark of maturing startups ecosystem. There are three key investment structures to consider when deciding how to form CVC funds; direct investments from Japan, investing through US corporate fund or an LP fund. When forming a CVC fund, Japanese investors must complete notifications with their countries government and then incorporate in Delaware for US tax benefits and privacy concerns. Understanding all considerations around this structure is important so that proper filings can take place - including those with the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and under the US Securities Act."

            "text": "In 2019, Romy Lynch took part in Y Combinator \u2013 the US-born tech startup accelerator that has launched more than 3000 companies. It\u2019s one of the most familiar accelerator names out there and being part of the portfolio is a well-respected accolade on a global level. \u2013 especially for European innovators wanting to take on the world.\n\nBorn in Ireland, Romy has been making her presence known in the startup ecosystem. She\u2019s a founder in her twenties and the first Irish woman to take aprt in Y Combinator with her startup, Unflow. Launched in 2022, Unflow is trying to make mobile app development smooth and easy using low-code templates for screens, new features, updates, upselling ads and so forth, and it\u2019s been developed based on Romy\u2019s experience in the States -where she learned the importance of adaptability and how to know when to pivot.\n\nWe sat down with Romy to learn more about her entrepreneurial story \u2013 chatting about her experience as a young female founder, going from Europe to the US, developing Unflow, and all the ins and outs of pivoting, funding and startup realities.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about your entrepreneurial background \u2013 have you always had business in your blood?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have traditionally considered myself an entrepreneur even though I\u2019ve always been very ambitious. I think this stems from the fact that when I was growing up, I always felt like an entrepreneur was one of those people who could \u201cnever work for anyone else\u201d or was always coming up with new ideas which I felt didn\u2019t represent who I was. As I\u2019ve spent time in Silicon Valley and amongst a lot of different entrepreneurs, I\u2019ve realised that there are many types of entrepreneurs \u2013 key characteristics being ambitious, determined, not wanting to give up and having a different version of the world that they would like to live in.\n\nDid you have any inspiration/mentor that has helped you along the way?\n\nI\u2019ve been lucky to have an amazing support system of friends, family and teachers inspiring me and pushing me to do better. In terms of inspiration, I look to the women I\u2019ve seen, alone in the C-Suite and also female founder friends who are further along than me. (like the founders of Localyze) Some communities like Femstreet Y Combinator have been really great for networking and finding inspiration from other founders.\n\nCan you tell us about your experience taking part in Y Combinator?\n\nIt was an amazing experience, the partners have a way of giving advice that simultaneously gives you confidence in yourself while seriously questioning everything you\u2019ve done so far and pushing you to do better. Coming from a non-tech background, the network of people I met while there was incredible and as I mentioned above really changed the way I perceived myself as an entrepreneur\n\nYou\u2019re now building Unflow \u2013 can you tell us about the startup?\n\nUnflow lets anyone create and experiment with native in-app screens, no engineering help required (think onboarding carousels, engaging stories, quizzes, feedback popups). After building other apps, we realised just how complicated mobile app development is. There\u2019s huge potential for growth within the mobile app market and we want to make it easy for companies to do repeatable tasks well without taking up engineering resources. It\u2019s been an incredible journey building Unflow. We have built a really talented core team who work remotely and are distributed around Europe and in the US. We are working with some fantastic early customers to help them improve their mobile app experience for users, drive adoption and increase retention.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about mobile app development? What does it mean in layman\u2019s terms?\n\nMobile app development just refers to the engineering processes of building a mobile app. You have a lot of constraints around the platform on which you\u2019re publishing on (AppStore/Google Play) as well as the limited screen size. You have to think about notifications, screens, flows\n\nWhat are the problems in the industry and how can this impact the mobile app economy?\n\nMobile app development is quite constrained. There are a lot of clunky processes and it\u2019s difficult for teams to find the time to experiment and test new things. Another of the major challenges is that you\u2019re so dependent on the Apple and Google Play stores. This can really limit how much you experiment and can cause serious problems if Apple decides to reject your app.\n\nHow important is this sector for the wider tech space and society?\n\nI think we\u2019ve all been spending more time on our phones (not necessarily a good thing but a trend nonetheless!). Apps are where companies develop rapport with and loyalty among their customers.\n\nWhat are your future plans for Unflow?\n\nWe want a world where no-code merges with real code. Right now you have to make a choice: code everything from scratch or use a no-code solution. No-code solutions are limiting \u2013 they tend to break when you need something more unique or custom and while MVPs can be created using no-code, companies mature onto custom-developed projects. Custom development requires a lot of work and upkeep. Once you progress to a full-code solution, you lose a lot of flexibility and ease of experimentation. We\u2019re progressing to larger and larger customers. We want to hire more people \u2013 especially engineers to join us on the journey. We\u2019re expanding our business in the US at the moment so it\u2019s a really exciting time.\n\nCan you tell us about pivoting a startup \u2013 how do you know when you need to do it and why should it be an option?\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to make the decision to pivot your company \u2014 when you\u2019ve put a lot of work in there\u2019s a feeling of \u201csunk cost\u201d. For us, watching Dalton\u2019s pivoting video really helped get perspective. If you have customers, talk to them \u2013find out how much they love the product. And most importantly, ask yourself how you feel in your gut, what\u2019s the path to success with the startup, do you think you\u2019re able to bring it there? If you can, it\u2019s a good idea to take time off to think about it once you\u2019re refreshed.\n\nWhat about your experience getting investment \u2013 especially in the Valley, a notoriously cut-throat, men\u2019s world \u2013 what has it been like as a young woman?\n\nI think it\u2019s improved a lot. I have been lucky enough to have a lot of women mentors and be invited to female founder dinners and events. Honestly, I did a degree in mechanical engineering and then worked in manufacturing, where I was the only woman in my office so my entire career has been in very male-dominated fields. This experience taught me how important it is to be confident in yourself and project that confidence. We still have a very long way to go. There\u2019s still a lot of pattern-matching in the industry so underrepresented founders have a harder time breaking through, which is frustrating.\n\nWhat is most important to young female entrepreneurs \u2013 funding opportunities or mentorships?\n\nDefinitely funding opportunities. Silicon Valley and the ecosystem has a lot of advice and mentorship, which is great but at the end of the day to get your business off the ground you need money \u2013 especially in tech, engineers are expensive! I also think that the advice and mentorship you\u2019re going to get is going to be much better when the advisor is an investor and has skin in the game.\n\nWhat would be your words of advice for budding entrepreneurs?\n\nJust go for it \u2013 and don\u2019t be afraid to email people or reach out for advice, a highly personalised email or LinkedIn message will go a long way. Play to your strengths. Discover what you\u2019re good at and double down on it. As a non-coder, I thought my lack of coding experience was a negative but it has actually been positive as it gives me a fresh perspective on everything we are building in the company. Project a lot of confidence, sometimes even more than you feel inside. It will go a long way towards closing sales, getting investment and enticing people to join your company.",

As a bonus, this wireless world would avoid implanted charging cables being dislodged or becoming infected\u2014problems that are all too common today.\n\nScientists have been working on body-powered devices since the early 2000s\u2014until now, the tech has been too energy-hungry for the minute amounts of electricity that can be harvested from humans. But after two decades of advances, today\u2019s devices consume ultra-low amounts of energy, throwing open the gate to myriad ideas and prototypes that draw power from the people.\n\nA cellular powerhouse\n\nYour cells are basically batteries\u2014biochemical ones that convert sugary fuel into energy. German startup CELTRO is tapping into this living power source by utilizing arrays of microneedles to harvest tiny amounts of energy from hundreds of thousands of cells. CELTRO\u2019s first product will be a tiny autonomous pacemaker. \u201cA muscular contraction, like the heart, starts at one point and then propagates through the whole heart muscle,\u201d says CEO and cofounder Gerd Teepe. \u201cOur idea was to harvest energy at multiple points to use this avalanche effect.\u201d As well as harvesting energy, the multifunctional microneedles will plug into cardiac tissue to monitor the heart and deliver a helping electrical boost to restore pacing, if needed. In 2021, CELTRO raised seed funding for lab-based proof of concept studies.\n\nPaper fuel-cells\n\nFrench startup BeFC is building biobatteries with green credentials. Its fuel cell uses layers of carbon, cellulose, and glucose\u2014plus a sprinkling of proprietary enzymes. Adding a drop of fluid\u2014say, blood or urine\u2014sets off a reaction that generates electricity. The paper patches could power single-use diagnostic devices and continuous monitoring sensors, such as glucose-monitoring kits for people with diabetes. After use, the cells can even be composted\u2014unlike other miniature batteries that are eventually binned or incinerated. BeFC is currently raising Series A funding and expects to hit the market in 2024 with its first products.\n\nMy quivering heart\n\nParis-based CAIRDAC is designing a pacemaker that\u2019s powered by the heart itself. Its leadless pacemaker is packed into a capsule containing a piezoelectric energy harvester\u2014a pendulum that swings through heartbeats, blood flow, and vibrations. The oscillations are converted into electricity and stored until the device senses that the heart needs a jolt to reset the rhythm. The startup recently raised \u20ac17 million (around $18.3 million) in Series A financing to continue preclinical testing and move toward human trials.\n\nInterior illumination\n\nSolar panels are becoming a common household sight, and they could soon be lighting up med tech, too. Researchers from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, have found that a solar panel placed under the skin still yields up to 10 percent as much electricity as one in direct sunlight\u2014enough to power an ultra-low consumption sensor. A couple of hours in the sun can run an implantable temperature sensor for 24 hours, and the researchers say the best place for it is between the neck and the shoulder.\n\nThe hydroelectric heart\n\nMini-turbines could harness blood flow and turn it into electricity, according to researchers at the University of Bern in Switzerland. They\u2019ve designed a torpedo-shaped turbine that could be implanted into a blood vessel in the heart, generating electricity from blood flow, much like a hydroelectric power station. A big challenge, as yet unsolved, is how to avoid blood clots forming on the blades of the turbine, but in lab simulations the turbine generated enough energy to power commercially available leadless pacemakers.\n\nPiezo patches\n\nItalian startup PiezoSkin says it has developed an ultra-thin piezoelectric skin patch that can simultaneously measure movements and draw power from them. In one study, it used the patch to monitor neck movements in people with dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing\u2014but the firm\u2019s biocompatible film could also harvest power from other body movements and vibrations for sensors and wearables.\n\nFeeling the heat\n\nHumans radiate around 100 watts a day in thermal energy, and according to Swiss startup Mithras, harnessing this heat could power wearable biosensors and even implanted devices. Its thermoelectric generators, known as TEGs, create electricity by exploiting the temperature difference between the body and the environment. Mithras estimates that with a 5 degree Celsius difference, a 12-square-centimeter TEG skin patch could completely power a cochlear implant.\n\nThis article was originally published in the January/February 2023 issue of WIRED UK magazine.",

After having successfully initiated its pilot plant in 2022, the startup will allocate the new funds towards optimisation of its algae-based carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technology, in a bid to create further commercial interest in the high-value biomass products, as well as in a design project of the first full-scale demonstration unit.\n\n\n\nAlgiecel uses natural microalgae organisms, a highly compact and high-yield photobioreactor technology fitted into standard containers and a revenue-sharing business model to offer carbon capture as a service to industrial clients. The produced products are intended to be applied in the feed, food and cosmetics industry.\n\nIn the beginning of 2022, Algiecel was accepted into the BioInnovation Institute\u2019s Venture Lab programme, and some important milestones were achieved during 2022. Algiecel finalised the design and construction of its pilot plant, and a collaboration agreement with Danish Technical Institute (TI) was signed. The pilot plant is in operation at TI\u2019s premises in Taastrup, Denmark. The pilot technology has yielded strong initial results, seeing a major productivity increase from the initial test run in Q3 2022 to the start of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, European Union React grant and Innobooster grant funding totalling DKK 3m (\u20ac0.4m) has been obtained for the basic design of the first full-scale demonstration unit and pilot lab-scale downstream processing and shelf-life testing, respectively\u200b. On the commercial side, interest in the technology and the opportunity has been positive, demonstrated by letters of interest signed by potential technology clients and by potential buyers of the algae-based derivative products.\n\nWith the newly raised funds Algiecel is looking to switch its focus from pilot operations only into completing the full-scale design, as well as initiating algae-product application trials with potential clients and research institutes already identified. Moreover, building additional interest from potential future clients in the CCU technology will be an important focus area, and thus securing additional funding for the upcoming demonstration full-scale project will be key to the future development of Algiecel and the technology.\n\nHenrik Busch-Larsen, founder and CEO of Algiecel, commented in a press release: \u201cWe are very pleased and excited about the trust put in Algiecel, the team and the technology by such a well-renowned institution as Denmark\u2019s Export and Investment Fund. Denmark\u2019s Export and Investment Fund has underlined the need for companies to get on board with the sustainability agenda, and we will do our utmost to deliver good results in 2023, and we want to be measured upon our ability to do so!\u201d",
