            "text": "The current space architecture and methodologies for developing and fielding new space technologies came about before space was a contested arena. Or, perhaps in the time between when space was first a contested environment \u2014 the Space Race of the 1950s through the 1970s \u2014 and the present day. In the modern climate, nations such as China are seen as fierce competitors to the interests of the U.S. by military leaders.\n\nIn legacy acquisition strategies, large-scale satellites were constructed over lengthy periods of time, usually via cost-plus contracts, which compensate a contracting company for all of its expenses with an added sum for profit purposes. New tools were also often created during these projects in order to complete them. However, executives coming into new positions in the government are looking to change these strategies to better align them with the threats that have become increasingly concerning.\n\nOne such official is the Honorable Frank Calvelli , assistant secretary of the Air Force for space acquisitions and integrations.\n\n\u201cWe are transforming\u2026to a more proliferated and more resilient architecture that can be counted on during times of crisis and conflict,\u201d Calvelli outlined in a keynote address at GovCon Wire\u2019s 2023 Space Acquisition Forum on Wednesday.\n\nClavelli, who came into his newly established position in May 2022, said these evolutionary efforts will be achieved primarily by speeding up acquisition processes and \u201cshorten[ing] development cycles.\u201d He referenced the nine tenets of space acquisition that he introduced in Oct. 2022 as key to the execution of the changes. Clavelli\u2019s previously released directives include \u201cmaintain stability in programs,\u201d \u201cavoid over-classifying\u201d and \u201cenable teamwork.\u201d\n\nHowever, at the GovCon Wire event, Clavelli offered four calls to action \u2014 which, taken together, he dubbed a \u201csimple formula\u201d \u2014 that he believes will result in speedier acquisitions and thus a more efficient ability to respond to adversarial threats in the space domain.\n\nBuild smaller systems\n\nLarger satellite systems are logistically cumbersome due to the fact that they require large bus structures, tanks, payloads and components. Their testing and development is an extended process, even without significant design changes, so that even a fairly straightforward large satellite system is going to slow things down.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen from across the department, there are very few missions, if any, that require large satellites,\u201d Calvelli stated.\n\nUse existing technologies\n\nAccording to Calvelli, during contracted work, it\u2019s the instinct of both public and private sector entities to devise new technologies and spur innovation while they complete projects. They like to \u201cmake improvements to existing technology designs\u201d and institute upgrades to systems. Instead, Calvelli feels it is best to lean on the innovations already achieved by the private sector and in internal research and development efforts to complete space acquisition endeavors quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n\u201cWe must utilize existing technology and designs in order to minimize NRE or non-recurring engineering,\u201d the executive shared, referencing engineering that isn\u2019t repeatable and involves procedures and activities that have to be stood up and dismantled just for one project.\n\nUse shorter-length contracts\n\nContracts for procuring new space technologies should be less than three years, Calvelli argues. He says this will drive program stability, as protracted efforts that last up to five or 10 years can be marred by constant changes to a program baseline that are harmful to the quick delivery of capabilities. He told the virtual audience at the GovCon Wire event that drawn-out contract efforts can also confuse private sector participants and make it unclear how serious or committed their government sponsors are about the initiative at hand.\n\nUtilize firm-fixed-price contracts\n\n\u201cBuilding smaller satellites with low NRE and on fixed-price [contracts] adds a level of discipline, prevents the constant rethinking of programs and scope changes with each yearly budget build and avoids changes from cost reestimati[ons] and requirements,\u201d Calvelli explained.\n\nThus, rather than implement contracts that allow for a constant renegotiation of funding and resources \u2014 which would further contribute to a program instability \u2014 firm-fixed-price contracts can assist with creating and deploying space technology in a way that is durable and consistent.\n\nIf carried out, Calvelli sees these four steps \u2014 in conjunction with his aforementioned nine tenets \u2014 as instrumental in helping to bring much-needed tools into the hands of warfighters at a faster clip.",

            "text": "New Data Provides Insights Into an Early Era of Star Formation\n\nBy peering into a well-known star cluster within the Small Magellanic Cloud, Webb\u2019s NIRCam instrument has revealed many new pockets of star formation that have never been seen. Further, new structures appear in this image that provide a window into the stars feeding within.\n\nNGC 346, one of the most dynamic star-forming regions in nearby galaxies, is full of mystery. Now, it is less mysterious with new findings from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nNCG 346 is located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a dwarf galaxy close to our Milky Way. The SMC contains lower concentrations of elements heavier than hydrogen or helium, which astronomers call metals, compared to the Milky Way. Since dust grains in space are composed mostly of metals, scientists expected there would be low amounts of dust, and that it would be hard to detect. New data from Webb reveals the opposite.\n\nAstronomers probed this region because the conditions and amount of metals within the SMC resemble those seen in galaxies billions of years ago, during an era in the universe known as \u201ccosmic noon,\u201d when star formation was at its peak. Some 2 to 3 billion years after the big bang, galaxies were forming stars at a furious rate. The fireworks of star formation happening then still shape the galaxies we see around us today.\n\n\u201cA galaxy during cosmic noon wouldn\u2019t have one NGC 346 like the Small Magellanic Cloud does; it would have thousands\u201d of star-forming regions like this one, said Margaret Meixner, an astronomer at the Universities Space Research Association and principal investigator of the research team. \u201cBut even if NGC 346 is now the one and only massive cluster furiously forming stars in its galaxy, it offers us a great opportunity to probe conditions that were in place at cosmic noon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis video tours areas of NGC 346, one of the most dynamic star-forming regions in nearby galaxies. NGC 346, a star cluster that lies within a nebula, is located 210,000 light years away. It resides within the Small Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy close to our Milky Way.\n\nBy observing protostars still in the process of forming, researchers can learn if the star formation process in the SMC is different from what we observe in our own Milky Way. Previous infrared studies of NGC 346 have focused on protostars heavier than about 5 to 8 times the mass of our Sun. \u201cWith Webb, we can probe down to lighter-weight protostars, as small as one tenth of our Sun, to see if their formation process is affected by the lower metal content,\u201d said Olivia Jones of the United Kingdom Astronomy Technology Centre, Royal Observatory Edinburgh, a co-investigator on the program.\n\nAs stars form, they gather gas and dust, which can look like ribbons in Webb imagery, from the surrounding molecular cloud. The material collects into an accretion disk that feeds the central protostar. Astronomers have detected gas around protostars within NGC 346, but Webb\u2019s near-infrared observations mark the first time they have also detected dust in these disks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the building blocks, not only of stars, but also potentially of planets,\u201d said Guido De Marchi of the European Space Agency, a co-investigator on the research team. \u201cAnd since the Small Magellanic Cloud has a similar environment to galaxies during cosmic noon, it\u2019s possible that rocky planets could have formed earlier in the universe than we might have thought.\u201d\n\nThe team also has spectroscopic observations from Webb\u2019s NIRSpec instrument that they are continuing to analyze. These data are expected to provide new insights into the material accreting onto individual protostars, as well as the environment immediately surrounding the protostar.\n\nThese results were presented on January 11 in a press conference at the 241st meeting of the American Astronomical Society. The observations were obtained as part of program 1227.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the most advanced space science observatory in the world. It will unravel secrets of our solar system, explore distant worlds around other stars, and uncover the enigmatic structures and origins of our universe and humanity\u2019s place in it. The project is a collaborative effort led by NASA, with participation from the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency.",

Between the electron and the photons it emitted, a connection of \"quantum entanglement\" is formed. Credit: Ella Maru Studio\n\nResearchers from the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology have presented the first experimental observation of Cherenkov radiation confined in two dimensions. The results represent a new record in electron-radiation coupling strength, revealing the quantum properties of the radiation.\n\nCherenkov radiation is a unique physical phenomenon, which for many years has been used in medical imaging and in particle detection applications, as well as in laser-driven electron accelerators. The breakthrough achieved by the Technion researchers links this phenomenon to future photonic quantum computing applications and free-electron quantum light sources.\n\nThe study, which was published in Physical Review X, was headed by Ph.D. students Yuval Adiv and Shai Tsesses from the Technion, together with Hao Hu from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore (today professor at Nanjing university in China). It was supervised by Prof. Ido Kaminer and Prof. Guy Bartal of the Technion, in collaboration with colleagues from China: Prof. Hongsheng Chen, and Prof. Xiao Lin from Zhejiang University.\n\nThe interaction of free electrons with light underlies many known radiation phenomena and has led to numerous applications in science and industry. One of the most important of these interaction effects is the Cherenkov radiation\u2014electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle, such as an electron, travels through a medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that specific medium. It is the optical equivalent of a supersonic boom, which occurs, for example, when a jet travels faster than the speed of sound. Consequently, Cherenkov radiation is sometimes called an \"optical shock wave.\" The phenomenon was discovered in 1934. In 1958, the scientists who discovered it were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nSince then, during more than 80 years of research, the investigation of Cherenkov radiation led to the development of a wealth of applications, most of them for particle identification detectors and medical imaging. However, despite the intense preoccupation with the phenomenon, the bulk of theoretical research and all experimental demonstrations concerned Cherenkov radiation in the three-dimensional space and based its description on classical electromagnetism.\n\nNow, the Technion researchers present the first experimental observation of 2D Cherenkov radiation, demonstrating that in the two-dimensional space, radiation behaves in a completely different manner\u2014for the first time, the quantum description of light is essential to explain the experiment results.\n\nThe researchers engineered a special multilayer structure enabling interaction between free electrons and light waves traveling along a surface. The smart engineering of the structure allowed for a first measurement of 2D Cherenkov radiation. The low dimensionality of the effect permitted a glimpse into the quantum nature of the process of radiation emission from free electrons: a count of the number of photons (quantum particles of light) emitted from a single electron and indirect evidence of the entanglement of the electrons with the light waves they emit.\n\nIn this context, \"entanglement\" means correlation between the properties of the electron and those of the light emitted, such that measuring one provides information about the other. It is worth noting that the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the performance of a series of experiments demonstrating the effects of quantum entanglement (in systems different to those demonstrated in the present research).\n\nYuval Adiv says, \"The result of the study which surprised us the most concerns the efficiency of electron radiation emission in the experiment: whereas the most advanced experiments that preceded the present one achieved a regime in which approximately only one electron out of one hundred emitted radiation, here, we succeeded in achieving an interaction regime in which every electron emitted radiation. In other words, we were able to demonstrate an improvement of over two orders of magnitude in the interaction efficiency (also called the coupling strength). This result helps advance modern developments of efficient electron-driven radiation sources.\"\n\nProf. Kaminer says, \"Radiation emitted from electrons is an old phenomenon that has been researched for over 100 years and was assimilated into technology a long time ago, an example being the home microwave oven. For many years, it seemed that we had already discovered everything there was to know about electron radiation, and thus, the idea that this kind of radiation had already been fully described by classical physics became entrenched. In striking contrast to this concept, the experimental apparatus we built allows the quantum nature of electron radiation to be revealed.\n\n\"The new experiment that was now published explores the quantum-photonic nature of electron radiation. The experiment is part of a paradigm shift in the way we understand this radiation, and more broadly, the relationship between electrons and the radiation they emit. For example, we now understand that free electrons can become entangled with the photons they emit. It is both surprising and exciting to see signs of this phenomenon in the experiment.\"\n\nShai Tsesses says, \"In Yuval Adiv's new experiment we forced the electrons to travel in proximity to a photonic-plasmonic surface that I planned based on a technique developed in the lab of Prof. Guy Bartal. The electron velocity was accurately set to obtain a large coupling strength, greater than that obtained in normal situations, where coupling is to radiation in three-dimensions. At the heart of the process, we observe the spontaneous quantum nature of radiation emission, obtained in discrete packets of energy called photons. In this way, the experiment sheds new light on the quantum nature of photons.\"\n\nMore information: Yuval Adiv et al, Observation of 2D Cherenkov Radiation, Physical Review X (2023).

The project consists of two stages: data collection and registration using autonomous UAVs, and interpretation, analysis, and visualization of the data to evaluate plant physiology. Both stages will be conducted concurrently, with the results of one feeding into the other. While the use of UAVs to collect data on forest canopies is already common, the challenge lies in automating the technology to efficiently cover a designated area.\n\nBioprinted blueberry plant cells as a multi-use product for long-term space exploration\n\nCollaborators from UMaine include Bashir Khoda, associate professor of mechanical engineering, Doug Currie, associate professor of biological sciences, Justin Lapp, assistant professor of design mechanical engineering, and Yongjiang Zhang, assistant professor of applied plant physiology.\n\nThe long duration of space exploration presents a challenge in managing radiation risk for astronauts, both inside and outside of habitats and vehicles. One way to mitigate this risk is through the use of shielding and biologically derived antioxidants. Blueberry plant cells, which contain high levels of anthocyanin, offer a potential source of these antioxidants. In this project, a team of four researchers will investigate the potential for using blueberry cells, cultivated at high density through 3D bioprinting, as a source of antioxidants and as radiation shielding layers. The team will identify the plant cell type, develop a bio-ink formulation and bio-printing protocol, determine the properties and model the radiation interaction in bio-printed plant cell structures, and investigate the anthocyanins compound for neuron radiation mitigation. If successful, this project will advance the understanding of factors regulating plant cell differentiation and growth in harsh environments and provide a new option for radiation mitigation on Earth and in space.\n\nAerospace Science and Technology in Secondary Schools (ASTSS)\n\nResearchers at UMaine Wilhelm Alexander Friess, associate professor of mechanical engineering, Seth Campbell, associate professor of glaciology, Parinaz Rahimzadeh, assistant professor in remote sensing of natural resources, Shawn Laatsch, director of Versant Power Astronomy Center, Yongjiang Zhang, assistant professor of applied plant physiology, and Vikas Dhiman, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering will collaborate with Michael Davis, University of Southern Maine lecturer in mechanical engineering, Barbara Stewart, Bangor High School science department head, and Dan Moore, Southern Maine Community College professor and chair of biological sciences.\n\nThe Aerospace Science and Technology in Secondary Schools (ASTSS) program is designed to increase interest and knowledge in STEM fields related to aerospace among secondary school students. This is important for addressing the shortage of skilled workers in the aerospace industry and promoting diversity in the field. The ASTSS program uses research-based teaching methods and experiential learning to engage students in exploring the science behind unmanned aerial systems (UAS), also known as drones. Through this program, students will have the opportunity to participate in community-based projects using UAS to address local issues such as agriculture, water quality, and coastal erosion. The ASTSS team will work with the Bangor High School STEM Academy to pilot the program and develop curricular materials for high school students and teachers. The goal is to eventually expand the program to other schools across the country.\n\nRobust lifelong learning to improve the health of aquatic ecosystems\n\nResearchers from UMaine Salimeh Yasaei Sekeh, assistant professor of computer science, and Vikas Dhiman, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, will collaborate with Nima Pahlevan, Science System and Applications (SSAI) at the Terrestrial Information Systems Lab of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) remote sensing scientist.\n\nThis project presents a new way to address the problem of harmful algal blooms caused by cyanobacteria, which can harm the quality of water in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Algal blooms are difficult to track because new characteristics, such as phycocyanin features, are constantly being added. Current deep learning approaches that use hyperspectral images (HSI) are limited to static situations where no new information is added. This project aims to improve the ability to handle new information and to better understand algal blooms by using techniques such as lifelong learning (LL), which allows a system to continue learning and solving new problems as more information becomes available. The project also aims to make the system more robust by protecting it against poor data caused by clouds, sunlight, and other factors. Additionally, the project will work on improving the accuracy of measurements of phycocyanin concentration using HSI and overcoming challenges such as atmospheric effects and instrument noise.\n\nNew crops for space exploration\n\nCollaborators from UMaine include Stephanie Burnett, associate professor of horticulture, Jacob Schwab, graduate research assistant, and Mary Ellen Camire, professor of food science and human nutrition.\n\nDuring space travel, particularly for long-term missions, fresh vegetables and herbs grown by astronauts provide more flavor and nutrition than prepackaged food. Most of the work exploring new crops for hydroponic production has focused on commercial greenhouse production. In commercial production, there is much more room to grow crops. Further, the focus of greenhouse food production is on economic efficiency and profitability. This limits the variety of crops grown in commercial hydroponics to a small number of high-value crops, including leafy greens, herbs, tomatoes, and peppers. The goal for space agriculture would be to grow plants for flavor, nutrition, and a varied diet.\n\nThe goal of this project is to explore new crop options that can be grown hydroponically in a system similar to the one NASA uses to grow leafy greens in space. We plan to evaluate new crops based on their ease of production, availability of dwarf varieties, and taste. The primary goal is to find new crops that can be grown in a hydroponic system in space to provide diversity in astronauts\u2019 diets. It is notable, though, that much of the information about the taste and nutrition of fresh vegetables and herbs is measured in plants grown either in the field or in greenhouses. We will grow novel edible crops that are currently not grown in hydroponic greenhouse production or on NASA missions. These crops will include: peas, dwarf kale, and carrots. We plan to assess the texture and color of the plants, as well as the quantity of sugars.\n\nJumping and landing in extreme conditions: From biological systems to bio-inspired robots\n\nCollaborators from UMaine include Victor M. Ortega-Jimenez, assistant professor of integrative avian biology, and Evan K. Wujcik, assistant professor of chemical engineering.\n\nAerial control of jumping animals has shown that their unique adaptations and body morphing are fundamental for self-righting, as well as for a controlled landing. These skill sets are crucial for survival because they can reduce risks of physical damage during collision and rebound, as well as the response time against predators. In this regard, springtails, which have no wings, are exceptional because they have the ability, after an explosive jump, to recover from an upside-down orientation in less than 20 milliseconds. By adopting a U-shaped posture, these tiny animals control their mid-air posture via an aerodynamic torque. However, it is unknown what effects bad weather, such as turbulence and precipitation, have on the jumping and landing performance of animal jumpers. This research can inform the design of shape-morphing robots, made of flexible polymer-based materials, which could potentially be used for monitoring, sensing, and exploring the surface of other planets, where challenging environmental conditions may make flying systems unreliable. This aligns with the goals of NASA\u2019s exploration program.\n\nDecentralized and resource-efficient satellite swarm\n\nCollaborators from UMaine include Prabuddha Chakraborty, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, Salimeh Yasaei-Sekeh, assistant professor of computer science, and Vikas Dhiman, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.\n\nSmall satellites, especially nanosatellites, are widely used by NASA to perform a variety of tasks including surveillance, weather monitoring, and asset tracking. Such systems are often centrally controlled (prone to single-point failures) and are forced to operate with limited communication bandwidth, power, storage space, and processing capabilities. Through this project, researchers aim to push innovations in the areas of consensus-based decentralized control systems, domain and application adaptive data compression, and efficient neural network representations for mitigating the mentioned challenges.\n\nAI-Carb: An AI-based high-resolution carbon flux monitoring and simulation platform\n\nResearchers from UMaine Yongjiang Zhang, assistant professor of applied plant physiology, Salimeh Yasaei-Sekeh, assistant professor of computer science, Xinyuan Wei, postdoctoral research associate in forest ecosystem modeling, and Daniel Hayes, the Barbara Wheatland associate professor of geospatial analysis and remote sensing, will collaborate with Peter Nelson, Schoodic Institute forest ecology director.\n\nHigh-resolution carbon flux monitoring is crucial to understand mechanisms regulating ecosystem functioning and dynamics, and to predict their responses to future climate change. However, the tools currently used to monitor carbon flux in ecosystems have limitations that make it difficult to get a complete picture. In this study, researchers propose using a combination of different methods, including leaf measurements, thermal monitoring, machine learning, and hyperspectral imaging, to create a new artificial intelligence (AI) model for monitoring carbon flux at a high resolution. This model will be able to capture both the small-scale processes happening at the level of individual plants and the larger-scale movements of carbon in an ecosystem. It will also be able to simulate how plants and ecosystems might respond to climate change. By using this approach, the authors hope to create a more comprehensive and accurate tool for understanding carbon flux in different types of ecosystems.\n\nFounded earlier this year, the University of Maine Space Initiative brings together faculty, administrators, staff, and students to advance Maine\u2019s space-based economy and help meet the demand for a highly skilled workforce in space-related research, technology development, and commercialization.\n\nThe mission of the initiative is to support research and development in space science and engineering through a multidisciplinary approach. This includes the direct participation of non-STEM researchers to provide a unique perspective, supporting the needs of a new and innovative space economy workforce.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in the MSGC Ideas Lab or for more information about the UMaine Space Initiative, contact Melinda Pelletier or Saul Allen at um.space@maine.edu.",

Where conventional MEOLUT systems rely on six large parabolic antennas covering an area about the size of a football field and are only capable of receiving signals from six satellites (one per antenna), the MEOLUT Next solution, with its compact antennas taking up less than 6 square meters, tracks up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing distress beacon detection and expanding coverage. MEOLUT Next is capable of detecting distress signals from up to 5,000 km away.\n\nThales Alenia Space\u2019s MEOLUT NEXT solution, with its two small antennas located in less than 10 square meters, tracks up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing the distress beacon detection rate, while also expanding the coverage zone. Furthermore, since there are no mechanical components in these antennas, maintenance costs are the lowest on the market.\n\nThe solution is already operated by the main users of COSPAS-SARSAT (USA, Canada, France, the European Union, and Togo) and is today helping to save lives, as recently demonstrated in the Indian Ocean. On November 18, 2022, a MEOLUT Next antenna picked up a distress signal from the Asteria, a yacht skippered by Tapio Lehtinen competing in the Golden Globe race, 2,000 km southwest of La R\u00e9union, well outside the range of VHF radio and other communications systems. The Asteria was sinking fast, and Tapio just had time to put on his survival suit and jump into his liferaft before activating his COSPAS-SARSAT distress beacon. Within only four minutes, MEOLUT Next had pinpointed the boat\u2019s location to guide rescue crews to the scene and save the skipper.\n\nThales MEOLUT Next antenna in Goose Bay, Canada. Image is courtesy of Thales Alenia Space.\n\n\u201cThis is the first contract to deploy our MEOLUT Next solution in Asia, which is now present on the four continents of the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia,\u201d said Benoit Broudy, Vice President, Navigation at Thales Alenia Space in France. \u201cThales Alenia Space sees space as a new horizon, helping humankind to build a better, more sustainable life on Earth. Saving lives is something that ties in with our company\u2019s aspirations, as demonstrated by our contribution to COSPAS-SARSAT Search and Rescue services.\u201d\n\nCOSPAS-SARSAT is an intergovernmental organization founded by Canada, the United States, Russia and France. Operational since 1988 and deployed in more than 40 countries around the world, this satellite-based search and rescue distress alert detection and information distribution system is best known for detecting and locating emergency beacons activated by aircraft, ships and hikers in distress. Today, almost 1 million ships and 300,000 aircraft are equipped with COSPAS-SARSAT distress beacons. To date, the COSPAS-SARSAT service has saved more than 57,000 lives in more than 17,000 search and rescue events. In the last few years, Cospas-Sarsat has helped save an average of 7 lives every day.

As of press time, the launch was scheduled for Jan. 23.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the launch is a new technology designed to improve safety and reduce cost: NASA\u2019s Autonomous Flight Termination Unit, or NAFTU. The technology is critical for several reasons, not the least of which is that the Defense Department is requiring all space launches from U.S. facilities use autonomous termination systems by 2025, said David Pierce, director of NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on autonomous flight safety systems since around 2002, with the vision from the DoD that this would provide for increased access to space, responsive space, while also lowering the cost of launch operations,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe technology has been in development and tested on sounding rockets and expendable launch vehicles in a test capacity, he said. In conjunction with Kennedy Space Center, the Space Force and the Federal Aviation Administration, NASA developed NAFTU to pull in GPS data to determine if a vehicle is off course and then automatically terminate the flight if needed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been nothing short of a Herculean effort to get us to this point, which I view as a turning point in launch range operations \u2014 not just at Wallops, but across the United States,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe NAFTU system is going to enable launch companies, the venture class, smaller launch companies, to come [to] Wallops and be able to launch at an increased cadence, but also enable lower cost launch operations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe estimate that this could reduce launch range costs by as much as 30 percent at our range.\u201d\n\n\n\nNAFTU \u2014 which received FAA certification for the launch \u2014 is a generic software package that companies can customize for their systems, Pierce said. In Rocket Lab\u2019s case, they modified the platform into what they coined \u201cPegasus\u201d on the Electron rocket.\n\n\n\nRocket Lab has used automated termination technology on 20 of its New Zealand launches. It has resulted in a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in range costs and efforts, Beck said, describing it as \u201ca huge, huge game changer.\u201d\n\n\n\nEighteen different companies have expressed interest in acquiring NAFTU through NASA\u2019s technology transfer process, Pierce said.\n\n\n\nIn addition to being the first Electron launch in Virginia, the rocket will carry Virginia-based HawkEye 360\u2019s sixth cluster of three radio frequency surveillance satellites. \u201cThis is the first time HawkEye\u2019s flying with us, which is great to be able to fly them out of LC 2 here,\u201d Beck said.\n\n\n\nThe scheduled launch is the first of three Electron launches carrying HawkEye satellites. Rocket Lab will deliver 15 HawkEye satellites into low-Earth orbit within two years, according to a company press release.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to definitely expand our constellation capacity over the mid-latitudes in particular,\u201d said Adam Bennett, senior director of product marketing at HawkEye 360.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant enhancement for our customers, both domestically and globally, as we collect unique forms of radio frequency geospatial data and supply that to help solve a lot of critical mission needs around the globe,\u201d he added.\n\nTopics: Space, Space Operations, Robotics and Autonomous Systems",

            "text": "NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover has completed its investigation of Mars\u2019 atmosphere, which has revealed crucial information about the planet\u2019s meteorology. This information is crucial for preparing for future human expeditions to Mars.\n\nThe rover completed an investigation that lasted for one Martian year, which is equivalent to two years on Earth. The research was led by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez-Manfredi of the Centre for Astrobiology (CAB) in Madrid, and it has had the participation of a team from the UPV/EHU\u2019s Planetary Sciences Research Group. The team studied the seasonal and daily cycles on Mars\u2019 atmosphere, including temperature and pressure, as well as significant variations on other time scales resulting from different processes.\n\nA paper detailing the results is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\nThe Perseverance rover\n\nPerseverance is a NASA autonomous vehicle that arrived at the Jezero Crater (the bed of an ancient, now dried-up lake on Mars) on 18 February 2021.\n\nThe rover is equipped with seven novel, complex scientific instruments dedicated to exploring Mars\u2019 atmosphere in search of signs of possible past life, collecting and depositing samples to be brought back to Earth, testing new technologies for use in human exploration, and studying the planet\u2019s atmosphere in detail.\n\nTo study the atmosphere, the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) instrument has been obtaining novel results. Throughout the seasons, the average air temperature at the Jezero Crater, located near the planet\u2019s equator, is around -55\u00b0C, but varies greatly between day and night, with typical differences of around 50-60\u00b0C. In the middle of the day, the heating of the surface generates turbulent movements in the air as a result of the rise and fall of air masses which cease in the evening, when the air settles.\n\nWhat can pressure sensors reveal about life on Mars?\n\nPressure sensors show detailed seasonal changes on Mars\u2019 atmosphere, produced by the melting and freezing of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the polar caps, as well as by a complex, variable daily cycle, modulated by thermal tides in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe pressure and temperature of Mars\u2019 atmosphere oscillate with periods of the Martian solar day with their submultiples, following the daily cycle of sunshine greatly influenced by the amount of dust and the presence of clouds in the atmosphere,\u201d explained Agust\u00edn S\u00e1nchez-Lavega, professor at the Faculty of Engineering \u2013 Bilbao (EIB) and co-researcher of the study.\n\nBoth sensors are also detecting dynamic phenomena in the atmosphere that occur in the vicinity of the rover, for example, those produced by the passage of whirlwinds known as \u2018dust devils\u2019 because of the dust they sometimes kick up, or the generation of gravity waves whose origin is not yet well understood.\n\n\u201cThe dust devils are more abundant at Jezero than elsewhere on Mars\u2019 atmosphere and can be very large, forming whirlwinds more than 100 metres in diameter. With MEDA we have been able to characterise not only their general aspects (size and abundance) but also to unravel how these whirlwinds function,\u201d said Ricardo Hueso, a lecturer at EIB.\n\nFurthermore, MEDA has also detected the presence of storms thousands of kilometres away, which are similar in origin to terrestrial storms, as shown by the images from orbiting satellites. These storms move along the edge of the north polar cap, formed by the deposition of carbonic snow.\n\nWithin the rich variety of phenomena studied, MEDA has been able to characterise in detail the changes that have taken place on Mars\u2019 atmosphere by one of the dust storms, such as the one that developed in early January 2022. Its passage over the rover led to abrupt changes in temperature and pressure, accompanied by strong gusts of wind, which kicked up dust and hit the instruments, damaging one of the wind sensors.\n\n\u201cMEDA is providing high-precision, meteorological measurements enabling Mars\u2019 atmosphere to be characterised, for the first time, from local scales at distances of a few metres, as well as on the global scale of the planet by collecting information on what is happening thousands of kilometres away. All this will lead to a better understanding of the Martian climate and improve the predictive models we use,\u201d concluded S\u00e1nchez-Lavega.\n\n\n\n",
