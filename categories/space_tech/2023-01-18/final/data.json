            "text": "The forthcoming Union Budget 2023-24 will be crucial for the emerging space industry. Given the government\u2019s impetus in promoting the private sector\u2019s participation in this segment, the budgetary allocations are seen as potential triggers to promote the space sector\n\nIn a major policy decision, taken in June 2020, the government opened the space industry to the private sector. Despite being one of a few spacefaring nations in the world, India accounts for only about 2% of the space economy which is currently valued at about $ 360 billion.\n\nThe government also opened the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\u2019s facilities to the private sector for testing, tracking and telemetry, launch pads, and laboratories. It aimed to enable the private space industry to climb the value chain.\n\nIn 2021-22, the government allocated Rs 13,949.09 crore to the Department of Space out of which \u20b95,720.46 crores has been under the Revenue Budget and the rest of \u20b98,228.63 crore under the Capital Budget.\n\nBuilding upon the mandate, the government also created various independent agencies under the Department of Space. The government defined its strategic roadmap for enhancing the role of Non-Government Entities (NGEs) in the space sector through hand-holding, tech support, and providing them with a level playing field. By opening ISRO\u2019s space infrastructure to private companies, the government laid the ground for developing satellite systems, and the launch of rockets and vehicles developed by the private sector.\n\nAlso Read Boosting the space sector for Indian private players\n\nIn a bid to further the cause of the sector, the Indian Space Association has outlined key policy recommendations. According to Lt General AK Bhatt (Retd.), Director General of the Indian Space Association (ISpA) these recommendations are aimed to put forward the suggestions received from the space industry.\n\nRecommendations for the space sector\n\nProduction Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the space industry \u2013 The space industry has strongly urged the government to include a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for space tech players in the upcoming budget.\n\nIn the Union Budget 2021-22, the finance minister announced an outlay of INR 1.97 Lakh Crores for the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes for 13 key sectors, to boost domestic manufacturing in sunrise and strategic sectors.\n\nWhile the PLI Scheme extends to electronics manufacturing on building a vibrant and robust electronic component manufacturing ecosystem for multiple sectors such as IT Hardware, LED Products, Automotive, Medical Devices, Solar Cells, Energy Storage, etc., the space-related activities do not fall under the scheme.\n\nExperts point out the anomalies as the space component is linked to telecom and electronic systems.\n\n\u201cThe PLI scheme will promote research and development in India and provide incentives to entities engaged in the space sector,\u201d says General Bhatt, adding that the space sector is all about the investment in new technology.\n\nVoicing a concern similar to ISpA, the SatCom Industry Association of India (SIA-India), whose members include AsiaSat, Dhruva Space, and others, has put forth a demand for the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for space tech players in the upcoming budget.\n\nFinancial support from Government through loans & grants and tax incentives \u2013 The space sector is capital intensive which requires heavy investment in the early stage of the development of satellite, and space-based equipment, including the launch mechanism.\n\nThe industry suggests that the tax incentives for companies and organizations operating in the space sector may include reduced corporate tax rates, tax credits for research and development expenses, and other forms of financial support. General AK Bhatt further explained that the private space industry is still maturing at this stage and the incentive will drive the ecosystem. Bhatt further clarifies that the existing policies restrict such invectives for the first 10 years which is applicable to private players, including startups.\n\nMost of the startups in the space domain are nearing 9-10 years so the new draft space policy must extend the benefits to the industry beyond the 10-year mark.\n\nSince the new space policy is in its final stages of development, the provision of tax exemption for startups should be continued till the time the incumbent policy is implemented.\n\n\n\nParity in treatment of capital gains for shares of unlisted companies\u2013 Considering that most space-tech companies in India are startups and access to capital is an issue, it would be beneficial to create parity in terms of the short-term capital gains tax rate and treatment with respect to listed and unlisted entities.\n\nGST exemption for private satellite launch service providers \u2013 The GST exemption remains the focal point of policy recommendations. While the government has included it in the Draft Indian Space Policy 2022 for consideration, no decision is taken yet on this.\n\n\u201cGST exemption for the provision of satellite launch services must be provided to all the parties who are in the process of providing such services,\u201d Bhatt emphasized.\n\nThis would result in the creation of a level playing ground for the entire industry. The government may also consider providing deductions or credits for companies that incur these costs as part of their operations in the space sector. These measures are aimed at encouraging employment generation and supporting the growth of private satellite launch service providers.\n\nSpace technology parks \u2014 General Bhatt also urges the government to set up space technology parks and form a group of experts for the use of the space ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe development of a Space Technology Park (STP) ecosystem will create a thriving environment for commercial organizations of all sizes, including startups working on new space technology, and will allow the Indian government and industry to develop and improve products and services related to the space industry,\u201d Bhatt says.\n\nExemption from angel tax--Considering that most space-tech companies in India are startups and access to capital is an issue, it would be beneficial to exempt them from the angel tax bracket altogether as part of its efforts to support the growth of the space industry in India.\n\nOverall, experts believe that if these measures are implemented, it could create a favourable environment for companies operating in the space domain and encourage investment, research, and development with the goal of making India a global hub to produce space-based products.\n\nWith such strategic policy interventions, the Department of Space can further work towards tapping the immense potential of the private sector working in the space sector.",

            "text": "Glasgow-based startup Metahelios has created a long-distance camera that can distinguish between different materials from a still image. The first-of-its-kind camera captures 100,000 frames per second and uses meta-surfaces to manipulate light passing through a material.\n\nLaunched in January 2022, Metahelios was created by Charles Altuzarra and Yash Shah. It specializes in advanced imaging technology and is planning to send its cameras to space after securing support from the Start-up loans program. With the support of Transmit start-ups, both founders received \u00a325,000 each through British Business Bank\u2019s start-up loan programme.\n\nThe camera uses matasurfaces, a bunch of engineered electromagnetic materials designed specifically for impacting radio, optical, acoustic, and microwave in desired ways. It was identified as a priority area by the UK Government\u2019s 2021 Innovation Strategy.\n\nThis latest camera innovation by Metahelios can have several use cases, for example, in the agriculture sector for monitoring crops remotely or by climate scientists to observe cloud formations. Moreover, as opposed to remote sensing devices that have large moving parts including a rotating mirror, the metasruface integrated technology is compact and solid that can provide a significant boost to satellite imaging systems.\n\nThe entrepreneurs have plans to develop additional imaging products over the next six months and will be exploring additional sectors including healthcare, to support the early diagnosis of cancer and research into other illnesses.\n\nDr Charles Altuzarra, co-Founder and CEO of Metahelios, said: \u201cIt has always been a dream to be involved in a space mission and the development of this imaging technology could soon see that become a reality. We have so far conducted a range of tests in labs and on the ground, but the evidence and data that could be collected via a satellite will be invaluable for growing the business and taking our cameras to the next stage.\n\n\u201cScotland\u2019s space and satellite technology scene is booming and we have spoken to a number of companies interested in trialling our imaging technology for a range of applications. We are a small business with big ambitions to be at the forefront of the emerging market for metasurface technology and the funding from the Start up Loans programme has provided a welcome boost to help us to achieve our goals.\u201d\n\nBarry McCulloch, senior manager, UK Network, Scotland at the British Business Bank, said: \u201cThe technology industry in Scotland is thriving and it is great to see ambitious start-ups like Metahelios bringing pioneering technology to the market that could transform a range of sectors. Supporting innovative entrepreneurs is a key part of strengthening the UK\u2019s position as a science superpower and access to finance can help business owners with essential research and development activities to take their ideas to the next level.\u201d",

Col. Brian Fredrickson, U.S. Space Force SSC QZSS-Hosted Payload program manager. \u201cThis delivery of the first spaceflight-ready payload represents an important milestone for the mission.\"\n\n\n\nContracting specialists from the 374th AW secured critical in-country security support contracts for the QZSS mission and logistics specialists were responsible for the physical delivery of the eight pallets of QZSS-Hosted Payload equipment. Together, the team received the payload and successfully transported it from Yokota Air Base to the Japanese partner facility.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real MVPs of this effort are the Contracting Squadron and Logistics Readiness Squadron,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jennifer Malatesta, 374th MSG deputy commander. \u201cThe 374th MSG is honored to be a part of this historic bilateral effort in enhancing space domain awareness.\"\n\n\n\nMalatesta added that it was very rewarding to see the culmination of months of planning and preparation executed successfully.\n\n\n\n\"This is an exciting and important mission,\" said 1st Lt. Joe Santiago, QZSS-HP\u2019s Logistics & Security lead, adding that the delivery would not be possible without Space Force's partnership with Air Mobility Command to secure safe transit from Hanscom Air Force Base's 66th Air Base Wing in Massachusetts to Yokota Air Base's 374th Airlift Wing in Japan. \"QZSS-HP's success depends on the contributions of a number of mission partners on the US side, including our partners at Yokota and Hanscom.\"\n\nThe payload delivery follows the historic Memorandum of Understanding signed two years ago between Japan's National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS) and the US Space Force.\n\n\n\nAs the payloads arrive in Japan, the SSC program will then begin the next stage of integration to the two QZSS host satellites and to prepare for launch, effectively unifying the two nations in space.\n\n",

            "text": "CHENNAI : Dhruva Space founder Sanjay Nekkanti\u2019s obsession with satellites began early. It was 2008 and he was still in college. The country was basking in the success of Chandrayaan-1, India\u2019s first moon mission, which generated a lot of interest in the space programme, especially among students. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) decided to tap into this frenzy and asked universities to encourage students to build satellites. It offered to deploy the student satellites in orbit for free.\n\nChennai\u2019s SRM University was among the earliest to take up this offer. Nekkanti, who was pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering, was drafted into the university team building the satellite, thanks to his unusual hobby, ham radio (amateur radio, involving two-way communication). After many challenges, the SRMSat, designed to address pollution by monitoring carbon dioxide and water vapour in the atmosphere, was ready in 2010. It was put into orbit by Isro\u2019s PSLV-C18 (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) in October 2011.\n\nYou might also like\n\nBudget may put India's missing middle in Ayushman Bharat\n\nUPI for NRIs: What it means for India and Indians abroad\n\nNew IT Rules draft includes gaming intermediaries\n\nIndia is 3rd biggest auto market now. What do the numbers reveal?\n\nThe experience of building a satellite set Nekkanti thinking. \u201cI was surprised by the cost arbitrage that existed in building a satellite in India and appalled that no one was tapping this huge opportunity,\" he recalls.\n\nBarring Isro, no other organization was building satellites (or rockets) in India back then. When he graduated in 2010, he reached out to his SRMSat mates with the idea of starting a company that builds satellites. But they were sceptical and declined. Nekkanti put his entrepreneurial ambitions on hold and headed to Europe to pursue a Masters in Space Technology and Spacecraft Instrumentation.\n\nHe returned in 2012 and set up Dhruva Space to build satellites. The initial days were tough, with funding hard to come by. Investors questioned Nekkanti on his business plan. Four years later, the market was still unresponsive and he almost sold the company. Things began to change only in 2019, as investor interest picked up.\n\nToday, Dhruva Space is a sought-after satellite maker. On 26 November, it launched two of its own satellites, Thybolt-1 and Thybolt-2, on board PSLV-54. The company now offers end-to-end services\u2014building satellites, launching, tracking and maintaining them. It has raised $8 million in funding so far and has orders to put three satellites in space. Many foreign entities are in talks with Dhruva Space to build and launch their satellites.\n\nDhruva Space is a part of India\u2019s space odyssey 2.0. The transformation that the country\u2019s space sector is witnessing is not led by Isro but by the private sector, specifically, by startups. Apart from Dhruva, a clutch of space startups, including Agnikul Cosmos, Skyroot Aerospace, Digantara and Pixxel, are building and launching rockets, engines, as well as satellites that will do everything from generating high-resolution pictures of earth to tackling space debris. And they have investors making a beeline for India.\n\nTo be sure, this is just the beginning, and India has a long way to go to catch up with the likes of the US, Russia and China, but it is an endeavour well begun.\n\nIsro, long the standard bearer of India\u2019s space ambitions, has played a big role in facilitating this shift. As Pawan Goenka, chairman of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), the regulatory entity facilitating the private sector\u2019s participation in the space industry, put it: \u201cThe space sector is transitioning from being Isro-dominated to being Isro-enabled.\"\n\nThe Trigger\n\nIt all began in June 2020, when the government opened up the space sector. It had realised that India would not be able to catch up with other space powers and establish itself as a leading player without involving private players. The reasons were obvious; India\u2019s space budget of $1.7 billion (in 2022) was miniscule compared to the US\u2019s $30 billion and China\u2019s $14 billion (which includes $1 billion from its private players). While the US had 1,650 space assets and China had 450, India\u2019s, at last count, had less than 100.\n\nAlso, India remained a marginal player in the commercial space market, which involves building and launching satellites, ground tracking and other applications. \u201cIndia\u2019s share in the $440 billion global space market is just 2%,\" says Goenka. The government wants to increase this share to 10% through the private sector, which will be able to attract large-scale private capital. This rationale sparked reforms in the space sector, and in June 2022, IN-SPACe was operationalized to facilitate private sector participation. A Space Policy is expected soon.\n\nA lot has happened in the last nine months. \u201cOver 100 companies have come up in this sector and in 2022 they raised as much as $110 million, which is more than what private space players had raised cumulatively till 2021,\" says Goenka.\n\nThe space pack\n\nOn 18 November, just days before Dhruva\u2019s satellite launch, Skyroot Aerospace launched Vikram-S, India\u2019s first private rocket, from Isro\u2019s launch facility at Sriharikota.\n\n\u201cVikram-S was launched to validate 80% of the technology that will go into Vikram-1, our orbital launch vehicle,\" says Pawan Kumar Chandana, co-founder of Hyderabad-based Skyroot Aerospace.\n\nStarted in 2018 with an investment of \u20b910 crore, Skyroot expects the commercial launch of Vikram-1 by the end of 2023, deploying satellites weighing up to 500 kg in orbit. It has scheduled eight launches in 2024. The company has raised \u20b9526 crore in funding and counts GIC (Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund) and Mukesh Bansal (founder of fashion e-commerce company Myntra) among its investors.\n\nLike Skyroot, Agnikul Cosmos, located in the IIT Madras Research Park, wants to dominate the small satellite launch market. It is developing rockets fuelled by its patented semi-cryogenic engines (using liquid oxygen and kerosene as fuel). The company uses a unique method to make its rockets: it 3-D prints them. \u201cThis helps us to ready an engine in two weeks, as against months otherwise,\" says Srinath Ravichandran, CEO & co-founder, Agnikul Cosmos, which has so far raised \u20b9105 crore from investors. The company has already built a dedicated launchpad at Sriharikota and its first rocket is expected to blast off in the coming weeks. \u201cCommercial launches will happen by the end of this year,\" he adds.\n\nThere is no dearth of confidence in these young Indian space entrepreneurs. Awais Ahmed, co-founder & CEO of Bengaluru-based Pixxel, wants to build a constellation of 24 hyper spectral micro satellites, which will act as an \u201cMRI scanner\" of Earth. They will monitor deforestation, track air and water pollution, check forest biodiversity, as well as coastal and marine health apart from changes in the urban landscape. It launched three demonstration satellites in 2022.\n\n\u201cOur customers are very happy with the images. We are already in commercial business,\" says Ahmed. The company, which has raised $35 million, plans to launch six satellites in 2023.\n\nAnother Bengaluru-based aerospace company, Digantara, wants to address the problem of space debris and has developed an in-orbit device that will track it. Though space agencies monitor debris from the ground, tiny bits (less than 1cm in size) are difficult to track. There are estimated to be 130 million such pieces in space. Travelling at 18,000 miles per hour, they pose a threat to satellites in orbit. Digantara plans to launch a constellation of 40 satellites to gather data on space junk in low-earth orbit (LEO).\n\nDigantara is also looking at monitoring the weather in space. It recently launched two satellites (ROBI & Pushan-Alpha) to set up the world\u2019s first commercial space weather monitoring system. It plans to have eight such satellites by 2024. This, too, is a critical need. According to reports, in February 2022, a solar storm cost SpaceX 40 satellites.\n\nThe Catalyst\n\nThe advent of startups in the space sector would not have been possible but for significant technological changes in recent years. As Agnikul Cosmos\u2019 Srinath put it: \u201cBig gave way to small, few became many, far changed to near and long life became short.\" He is referring to how satellites have changed.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s SpaceX demonstrated this with its Starlink satellites. Earlier, satellites used to be huge. They weighed over three tonnes and were put in faraway geo-synchronous orbits (where they moved in tandem with India as the earth rotated).\n\nSpaceX showed the world that instead of one large satellite, a constellation of satellites could do a better job. The shortcoming of coverage (smaller satellites cover a smaller area) is thus tackled with a constellation. SpaceX launched 4,000 small satellites in low-earth orbit instead of 10 big ones in a geosynchronous orbit to provide its internet services.\n\nAirtel-backed OneWeb is in the process of launching 648 small satellites in LEO mode to provide its high-speed satellite internet service.\n\nSmaller satellites have distinct advantages over large ones. They can be built quickly. Being closer to earth, they offer better latency (less delay in receipt of a signal). \u201cToday, a 3 kg satellite can take pictures with 3-metre resolution. A few years ago, it required a 300 kg satellite,\" says Skyroot\u2019s Chandana. The life of smaller satellites is just around three years \u2014 unlike 15 years for large ones \u2014 but that is not a worry as technology is evolving rapidly and older satellites can be replaced by those with newer tech.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait 15 years as the technology will become obsolete\" says Dhruva Space\u2019s Nekkanti. Unlike in the case of a large satellite, a constellation of satellites can continue to offer services even if a few malfunction.\n\n\u201cThey will still be cheaper than a single large one,\" says Agnikul Cosmos\u2019 Srinath. This is because smaller satellites use industry-grade rather than space-grade components (as they are parked closer to earth, where radiation is lower and have a shorter lifespan). Moreover, while an Insat class satellite will cost at least \u20b9400 crore, smaller satellites can be built for just \u20b910 crore, says Pixxel\u2019s Ahmed. Also, smaller satellites are placed in low orbit and at the end of their lives they can be lowered into the atmosphere to burn out (using onboard fuel) leaving no space junk.\n\nThere is no need for large launch vehicles such as the PSLV or GSLV (geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle), which cost \u20b9300 crore and \u20b9450 crore, respectively, to launch small satellites. The rockets that Skyroot and Agnikul Cosmos are building will cost a fraction of that, at around \u20b920 crore. \u201cIt is this reduction in cost that has made the private sector\u2019s entry in the space sector possible,\" says Srinath. No investor would want to support a private player who needs \u20b9400 crore to build just one satellite or launch vehicle, he adds.\n\nAccording to European Space Agency data, since the beginning of the space age (in 1957, when the USSR launched the Sputnik satellite), 14,710 satellites have been put into orbit. Experts estimate that anywhere between 70,000 to 100,000 satellites will be launched in the next 15 years and over 80% will be small satellites weighing less than 500 kg. It is this market that Indian space startups are looking to take advantage of as they are nimble (they can launch quickly unlike Isro, which needs months to ready a launch vehicle) and can deploy satellites at specific locations\u2014a critical requirement when it comes to a constellation.\n\nISRO\u2019s role\n\nSo, where does all this leave Isro? \u201cIt will play a leading role in enabling the private sector to come in, through IN-SPACe,\" says Goenka. The private sector will rely on Isro for infrastructure\u2014be it launch facilities, tracking systems, technology transfers and capacity building. India\u2019s space agency will focus on scientific missions, passing on the commercial business to the private sector, he adds.\n\nIsro, whose accomplishments to date include 121 spacecraft missions, 87 launch missions and 385 foreign satellite launches, will focus on deep-space missions, and putting an Indian in space through its Gaganyaan mission. It is also working on a small satellite launch vehicle, a reusable launch vehicle and an air-breathing propulsion system.\n\nIsro has set up NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL) to handle the commercial end of the business. In September, HAL and L&T bagged a \u20b9860 crore contract for the manufacture of five PSLVs over four years from NSIL.\n\nPrivate space players, on their part, are eagerly looking forward to India\u2019s space policy, which is due soon. They expect a policy that is clear and liberal. \u201cThe draft policy is encouraging,\" says Pixxel\u2019s Ahmed.\n\nMany call the recent policy changes the Indian space sector\u2019s \u20181991 moment\u2019. Going by the giant leap space startups have made in such a short period, that certainly appears to be the case.\n\nElsewhere in Mint\n\nIn Opinion, Vivek Kaul says IDBI Bank sell-off could be a precursor for sale of other PSBs.

            "text": "Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales and Leonardo, has signed a contract with prime contractor Appworks to provide Thailand with a complete Search And Rescue (SAR) operational system based on the COSPAS-SARSAT MEOSAR Service.\n\nThe solution will make it possible to detect and locate distress signals from COSPAS-SARSAT beacons on land, in the air and at sea instantaneously, over a radius of 2,500 km centred around Bangkok, mainly using the Galileo satellite positioning system. This solution also includes delivery of a Mission Control Centre (MCC) dedicated to managing and distributing alerts, and a Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) to manage all search-and-rescue activities for armed forces, coastguards, sea rescue and other services.\n\nThales Alenia Space\u2019s innovative MEOLUT Next product, which employs a phased array antenna, will give Thailand unrivalled performance. Where conventional MEOLUT systems rely on six large parabolic antennas covering an area about the size of a football field and are only capable of receiving signals from six satellites (one per antenna), the MEOLUT Next solution, with its compact antennas taking up less than 6 square metres, tracks up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing distress beacon detection and expanding coverage. MEOLUT Next is capable of detecting distress signals from up to 5,000 km away.\n\nThe solution is already operated by the main users of COSPAS-SARSAT (USA, Canada, France, the European Union, and Togo) and is today helping to save lives, as recently demonstrated in the Indian Ocean. On November 18, 2022, a MEOLUT Next antenna picked up a distress signal from the Asteria, a yacht skippered by Tapio Lehtinen competing in the Golden Globe race, 2,000 km southwest of La R\u00e9union, well outside the range of VHF radio and other communications systems. The Asteria was sinking fast, and Tapio just had time to put on his survival suit and jump into his liferaft before activating his COSPAS-SARSAT distress beacon. Within only four minutes, MEOLUT Next had pinpointed the boat\u2019s location to guide rescue crews to the scene and save the skipper.\n\n\u201cThis is the first contract to deploy our MEOLUT Next solution in Asia, which is now present on the four continents of the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia.\u201d said Benoit Broudy, Vice President Navigation at Thales Alenia Space in France. \u201cThales Alenia Space sees space as a new horizon, helping humankind to build a better, more sustainable life on Earth. Saving lives is something that ties in with our company\u2019s aspirations, as demonstrated by our contribution to COSPAS-SARSAT Search and Rescue services.\u201d\n\nCOSPAS-SARSAT is an intergovernmental organization founded by Canada, the United States, Russia and France. Operational since 1988 and deployed in more than 40 countries around the world, this satellite-based search-and-rescue distress alert detection and information distribution system is best known for detecting and locating emergency beacons activated by aircraft, ships and hikers in distress. Today, almost 1 million ships and 300,000 aircraft are equipped with COSPAS-SARSAT distress beacons. To date, the COSPAS-SARSAT service has saved more than 57,000 lives in more than 17,000 search-and-rescue events. In the last few years, COSPAS-SARSAT has helped save an average of seven lives every day.\n\nConventional MEOLUT (Medium Earth Orbit Local User Terminal) systems use large parabolic antennas and are limited by how many satellite signals they can receive. Thales Alenia Space\u2019s MEOLUT Next solution is compact, measuring less than six square meters and is able to track up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing distress beacon detection while expanding coverage. Since there are no mechanical components, hardware maintenance costs are the lowest on the market.\n\nFor Editorial Inquiries Contact:\n\nEditor Matt Driskill at matt.driskill@asianaviation.com\n\nFor Advertising Inquiries Contact:\n\nHead of Sales Kay Rolland at kay.rolland@asianaviation.com",

            "text": "Two astronauts will complete the first spacewalk of the year continuing a rush of activity on the International Space Station as the orbiting laboratory prepares for another busy year of research in low-Earth orbit.\n\nNASA astronaut Nicole Mann and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Koichi Wakata will begin their 6.5-hour spacewalk on Friday around 8 a.m. after exiting the ISS airlock.\n\nWakata will wear the spacesuit with red stripes, and Mann's spacesuit will be stripe-less.\n\nThis will mark the first spacewalk for both astronauts and allow all the Crew-5 astronauts to have completed at least one spacewalk during their mission. The Crew-5 mission is Mann's first spaceflight. Wakata recently marked his 400th cumulative day in space throughout his career.\n\nMann and Wakata's tasks outside the ISS will be to install a frame, known as struts, to support the next pair of international Roll-Out Solar Arrays known as iROSAs.\n\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n\nThere are four iROSAs currently installed outside the International Space Station installed over a handful of spacewalks as part of an effort to upgrade the station's power grid. The solar arrays arrive in space rolled up like carpets and unfurl in space.\n\n\"They're supplying about nine kilowatts of power, which is going towards a lot of payloads and science,\" NASA's Spacewalk Flight Director Chloe Mehring said of the four iROSAs.\n\nThe astronauts will also tighten some bolts and cables. If there is time, they could complete some \"get ahead tasks\" working ahead to help speed up the next iROSA installation.\n\nNASA's ISS Program operations integration manager Dina Contella estimated the next set of solar arrays from Boeing and Redwire Space would launch sometime in June on SpaceX's 28th resupply mission to the space station.\n\nNASA management has been pleased with the new roll-out of solar arrays. The space agency also plans to use the arrays on Gateway, a small orbiting outpost around the moon where astronauts will stop before heading down to the lunar surface.\n\n\"When you see the arrays unfurl, and they seem to do so perfectly and then provide power right away, it's really impressive,\" Contella said. \"This is proving this is a good technology. They're lightweight and flexible, easy to launch. And I do think this is a really good methodology, and we are planning to use it in the future.\"\n\nNASA lead spacewalk Officer Keith Johnson said the innovative iROSAs are a step forward in power generation technology.\n\n\"It's always the right direction to be able to update and accommodate higher power capacity, higher storage, and for all the use that we want to get out of the station,\" Johnson said.\n\nNonstop space traffic\n\nActivity on the International Space Station is always ongoing, and the astronauts live by a very detailed schedule. Their days are packed with science research, outreach events talking to people back on Earth, ISS maintenance, working out in the low-gravity gym, personal time and sleep.\n\nSince November, astronauts have completed three spacewalks, and Northrop Grumman and SpaceX cargo supply vehicles have either come or gone from the space station.\n\n\"It\u2019s been really busy,\" Contella said. \"We\u2019ve had a lot happening, I'd say. Multiple vehicles coming and going and spacewalks.\"\n\nAdditionally, the crew has made adjustments due to the Russian Soyuz spacecraft leaking coolant.\n\nThe spacecraft was how Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin and NASA Astronaut Frank Rubio arrived at the ISS in September and would have been their ride home before it began leaking coolant. Engineers believe the leak was caused by a space debris strike to the spacecraft.\n\nNow Russia will send up another Soyuz spacecraft in mid-February to bring the crew back to Earth.\n\nContella said after the new Soyuz arrives, the crew will spend \"several more months\" in space before coming home, possibly in September. The problem Soyuz spacecraft will autonomously return to Earth after the new one arrives.\n\nUntil the new Soyuz arrives, the astronauts moved Rubio's seat liner to the SpaceX Crew Dragon in case of an emergency evacuation. The old Soyuz will remain the emergency evacuation plan for Prokopyev and Petelin.\n\nNASA and SpaceX are planning to launch the Crew-6 astronaut mission to the ISS in late February, and the Crew-5 astronauts would undock and return home a few days after the Crew-6 mission's arrival.\n\nSTELLAR SNACK: HOW A BLACK HOLE EATS A DOOMED STAR FOR BREAKFAST\n\nThere are also two re-supply missions planned for February, Russia's Progress supply vehicle and SpaceX's Cargo Dragon on its 27th re-supply mission for NASA.\n\nNorthrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo spacecraft that arrived in November will undock from the ISS sometime in March.\n\nIn April, Boeing is scheduled to launch its first astronauts to the ISS on the CST-100 Starliner. The crewed flight test will be the final step to certify Boeing's capsule to fly astronauts as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program like SpaceX has been doing since 2020.",

            "text": "The planet is rocky and almost precisely the same size as Earth, but whips around its star in only two days.\n\nResearchers using NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope have formally embarked on a new frontier: Identifying and analyzing rocky exoplanets that orbit red dwarf stars. A team led by Kevin Stevenson and Jacob Lustig-Yaeger, both of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed that LHS 475 b not only exists, but it is a small, rocky planet that is almost exactly the same size as Earth. Before Webb, researchers typically targeted planets that are larger than Jupiter, which is 11 times wider than Earth. This will inevitably be the first of many discoveries Webb data will help researchers make as they continue exploring planets elsewhere in our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nUsing NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, researchers confirmed an exoplanet, a planet that orbits another star, for the first time. Formally classified as LHS 475 b, the planet is almost exactly the same size as our own, clocking in at 99% of Earth\u2019s diameter. The research team is led by Kevin Stevenson and Jacob Lustig-Yaeger, both of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nA Red Dwarf Star (M dwarf) is a small, low-mass, dim, and cool star. Many have big flares and mass ejections on their surfaces. The habitable zone of red dwarf stars is closer to the star than stars like our sun, making it easier to observe potentially habitable planets.\n\nThe team chose to observe this target with Webb after carefully reviewing targets of interest from NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which hinted at the planet\u2019s existence. Webb\u2019s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) captured the planet easily and clearly with only two transit observations. \u201cThere is no question that the planet is there. Webb\u2019s pristine data validate it,\u201d said Lustig-Yaeger. \u201cThe fact that it is also a small, rocky planet is impressive for the observatory,\u201d Stevenson added.\n\n\u201cThese first observational results from an Earth-size, rocky planet open the door to many future possibilities for studying rocky planet atmospheres with Webb,\u201d agreed Mark Clampin, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \u201cWebb is bringing us closer and closer to a new understanding of Earth-like worlds outside our solar system, and the mission is only just getting started.\u201d\n\nAmong all operating telescopes, only Webb is capable of characterizing the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. The team attempted to assess what is in the planet\u2019s atmosphere by analyzing its transmission spectrum. Although the data show that this is an Earth-sized terrestrial planet, they do not yet know if it has an atmosphere. \u201cThe observatory\u2019s data are beautiful,\u201d said Erin May, also of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \u201cThe telescope is so sensitive that it can easily detect a range of molecules, but we can\u2019t yet make any definitive conclusions about the planet\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAlthough the team can\u2019t conclude what is present, they can definitely say what is not present. \u201cThere are some terrestrial-type atmospheres that we can rule out,\u201d explained Lustig-Yaeger. \u201cIt can\u2019t have a thick methane-dominated atmosphere, similar to that of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan.\u201d\n\nThe team also notes that while it\u2019s possible the planet has no atmosphere, there are some atmospheric compositions that have not been ruled out, such as a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere. \u201cCounterintuitively, a 100% carbon dioxide atmosphere is so much more compact that it becomes very challenging to detect,\u201d said Lustig-Yaeger. Even more precise measurements are required for the team to distinguish a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere from no atmosphere at all. The researchers are scheduled to obtain additional spectra with upcoming observations this summer.\n\nWebb also revealed that the planet is a few hundred degrees warmer than Earth, so if clouds are detected, it may lead the researchers to conclude that the planet is more like Venus, which has a carbon dioxide atmosphere and is perpetually shrouded in thick clouds. \u201cWe\u2019re at the forefront of studying small, rocky exoplanets,\u201d Lustig-Yaeger said. \u201cWe have barely begun scratching the surface of what their atmospheres might be like.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also confirmed that the planet completes an orbit in just two days, information that was almost instantaneously revealed by Webb\u2019s precise light curve. Although LHS 475 b is closer to its star than any planet in our solar system, its red dwarf star is less than half the temperature of the Sun, so the researchers project it still could have an atmosphere.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 findings have opened the possibilities of pinpointing Earth-sized planets orbiting smaller red dwarf stars. \u201cThis rocky planet confirmation highlights the precision of the mission\u2019s instruments,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cAnd it is only the first of many discoveries that it will make.\u201d Lustig-Yaeger agreed. \u201cWith this telescope, rocky exoplanets are the new frontier.\u201d\n\nLHS 475 b is relatively close, at only 41 light-years away, in the constellation Octans.\n\nThe team\u2019s results were presented at a press conference of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) on January 11, 2023.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the world\u2019s premier space science observatory. Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).",

            "text": "We live in an era of renewed space exploration, where multiple agencies are planning to send astronauts to the Moon in the coming years. This will be followed in the next decade with crewed missions to Mars by NASA and China, who may be joined by other nations before long. These and other missions that will take astronauts beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and the Earth-Moon system require new technologies, ranging from life support and radiation shielding to power and propulsion. And when it comes to the latter, Nuclear Thermal and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NTP/NEP) is a top contender!\n\nNASA and the Soviet space program spent decades researching nuclear propulsion during the Space Race. A few years ago, NASA reignited its nuclear program for the purpose of developing bimodal nuclear propulsion \u2013 a two-part system consisting of an NTP and NEP element \u2013 that could enable transits to Mars in 100 days. As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program for 2023, NASA selected a nuclear concept for Phase I development. This new class of bimodal nuclear propulsion system uses a \u201cwave rotor topping cycle\u201d and could reduce transit times to Mars to just 45 days.\n\nThe proposal, titled \u201cBimodal NTP/NEP with a Wave Rotor Topping Cycle,\u201d was put forward by Prof. Ryan Gosse, the Hypersonics Program Area Lead at the University of Florida and a member of the Florida Applied Research in Engineering (FLARE) team. Gosse\u2019s proposal is one of 14 selected by the NAIC this year for Phase I development, which includes a $12,500 grant to assist in maturing the technology and methods involved. Other proposals included innovative sensors, instruments, manufacturing techniques, power systems, and more.\n\nNuclear propulsion essentially comes down to two concepts, both of which rely on technologies that have been thoroughly tested and validated. For Nuclear-Thermal Propulsion (NTP), the cycle consists of a nuclear reactor heating liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) propellant, turning it into ionized hydrogen gas (plasma) that is then channeled through nozzles to generate thrust. Several attempts have been made to build a test this propulsion system, including Project Rover, a collaborative effort between the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) that launched in 1955.\n\nIn 1959, NASA took over from the USAF, and the program entered a new phase dedicated to spaceflight applications. This eventually led to the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA), a solid-core nuclear reactor that was successfully tested. With the closing of the Apollo Era in 1973, the program\u2019s funding was drastically reduced, leading to its cancellation before any flight tests could be conducted. Meanwhile, the Soviets developed their own NTP concept (RD-0410) between 1965 and 1980 and conducted a single ground test before the program\u2019s cancellation.\n\nNuclear-Electric Propulsion (NEP), on the other hand, relies on a nuclear reactor to provide electricity to a Hall-Effect thruster (ion engine), which generates an electromagnetic field that ionizes and accelerates an inert gas (like xenon) to create thrust. Attempts to develop this technology include NASA\u2019s Nuclear Systems Initiative (NSI). Project Prometheus (2003 to 2005). Both systems have considerable advantages over conventional chemical propulsion, including a higher specific impulse (Isp) rating, fuel efficiency, and virtually unlimited energy density.\n\nWhile NEP concepts are distinguished for providing more than 10,000 seconds of I sp , meaning they can maintain thrust for close to three hours, the thrust level is quite low compared to conventional rockets and NTP. The need for an electric power source, says Gosse, also raises the issue of heat rejection in space \u2013 where thermal energy conversion is 30-40% under ideal circumstances. And while NTP NERVA designs are the preferred method for crewed missions to Mars and beyond, this method also has issues providing adequate initial and final mass fractions for high delta-v missions.\n\nNew Class of Bimodal NTP/NEP with a Wave Rotor Topping Cycle Enabling Fast Transit to Mars. Credit: Ryan Gosse\n\nThis is why proposals that include both propulsion methods (bimodal) are favored, as they would combine the advantages of both. Gosse\u2019s proposal calls for a bimodal design based on a solid core NERVA reactor that would provide a specific impulse (I sp ) of 900 seconds, twice the current performance of chemical rockets. Gosse proposed cycle also includes a pressure wave supercharger \u2013 or Wave Rotor (WR) \u2013 a technology used in internal combustion engines that harnesses the pressure waves produced by reactions to compress intake air.\n\nWhen paired with an NTP engine, the WR would use pressure created by the reactor\u2019s heating of the LH 2 fuel to compress the reaction mass further. As Gosse promises, this will deliver thrust levels comparable to that of a NERVA-class NTP concept but with an I sp of 1400-2000 seconds. When paired with a NEP cycle, said Gosse, thrust levels are enhanced even further:\n\n\u201cCoupled with an NEP cycle, the duty cycle Isp can further be increased (1800-4000 seconds) with minimal addition of dry mass. This bimodal design enables the fast transit for manned missions (45 days to Mars) and revolutionizes the deep space exploration of our solar system.\u201d\n\nBased on conventional propulsion technology, a crewed mission to Mars could last up to three years. These missions would launch every 26 months when Earth and Mars are at their closest (aka. a Mars Opposition) and would spend a minimum of six to nine months in transit. A transit of 45 days (six and a half weeks) would reduce the overall mission time to months instead of years. This would significantly reduce the major risks associated with missions to Mars, including radiation exposure, the time spent in microgravity, and related health concerns.\n\nArtist\u2019s concept of a bimodal nuclear rocket making the journey to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the Solar System. Credit: NASA\n\nIn addition to propulsion, there are proposals for new reactor designs that would provide a steady power supply for long-duration surface missions where solar and wind power are not always available. Examples include NASA\u2019s Kilopower Reactor Using Sterling Technology (KRUSTY) and the hybrid fission/fusion reactor selected for Phase I development by NASA\u2019s NAIC 2023 selection. These and other nuclear applications could someday enable crewed missions to Mars and other locations in deep space, perhaps sooner than we think!\n\nFurther Reading: NASA",
