Laid-off employees included those who had previously received high performance reviews or held managerial positions with annual compensation packages of $500,000 to $1 million, according to managers who spoke to The Information.\n\nThe 12,000 or so affected employees spanned nearly every organization, from Google Cloud and Chrome to Android and search-related groups under senior executive Prabhakar Raghavan, these people said. The cloud unit has been among the fastest growing parts of Google in recent years, as The Information has reported, but has struggled to win big customer deals and recently parted ways with senior sales leaders in a reorganization. Google Cloud laid off people in strategy, recruiting, and so-called go-to-market teams that provide salespeople with data, training and research for making deals. It also laid off salespeople in places like Austin, said a person briefed about them.",

            "text": "Technology and digitalisation have brought a paradigm shift across major industries, including the educational sector. In 2019, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit us, learning became virtual and subsequently, classrooms became 'phygital' - a learning approach using a blend of traditional methods and technological intervention.\n\nUnsplash\n\nCurrently, educational technologies (Edtech) are redefining the educational space. As per media reports, edech players entered the market around 2012 and the period between 2012 and 2019 came to be known as the era of edtech revolution. A 2021 report by the consulting firm, PriceWaterCoopers, along with the Confederation of Indian Industry notes,\n\n\"Edtech is expected to play a vital role in the Indian education system and grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 30% to reach a market size of USD 10.4 billion by 2025.\" Market Research and strategy consulting firm Global Market Insights has also predicted that the e-learning market by 2028 will exceed $1 trillion.\n\nExperts feel edtech can help streamline the administrative process, teacher-parent-and-student communication, simplify curricula planning and bring about more transparency in the examination process.\n\nUnsplash\n\nHow could edtech change the Indian education system? Let us find out.\n\nCustomised learning experience\n\nEach child has different learning needs and customised or personalised teaching is a non-linear student-centric educational approach that is administered as per each child\u2019s capabilities. With the aid of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data and Augmented Learning (AL), teachers can provide customised teaching material to students. These technologies enhance the student\u2019s creativity, provide an immersive experience, and promote critical thinking. These methods bridge gaps in the educational system and enable students to learn at their own pace.\n\nCloud-based infrastructure\n\nMany educational institutions across the world are shifting to cloud-based infrastructure, especially after the advent of post-pandemic, online teaching. This infrastructure enables teachers to teach from anywhere and the student can access the class virtually. In India, where the absence of adequate infrastructure in rural areas often inhibits girls from enrolling into schools, digital equity and cloud-based infrastructure can fill a huge gap. Cloud-based initiatives that operate in a virtual mode, reduce the infrastructural cost of classrooms and also help students to access learning materials easily.\n\n\n\nStock Image\n\nVirtual labs to enhance lab skills\n\nThe pandemic clearly laid bare the extent of educational disparity in India and it may be some time before we can think of accessible virtual labs for all students but this trend will hopefully become normative in all institutes. This type of learning enhances the student\u2019s laboratory skills in a virtual environment and is devoid of any constraint that real labs face. Virtual labs allow students to perform experiments in a risk-free and interactive learning environment and follow a pedagogical method that simplifies theoretical concepts. These AI-powered laboratories offer a flexible learning space where the student gets a chance to redo experiments without any stress.\n\nBlockchain for streamlined administration\n\nBlockchain technology has made the education sector more transparent and accountable. The ledger technology in blockchain helps in keeping a record of events in a chronological manner and also streamlines the fee payment process. Through blockchain, teachers can keep track of attendance, and also update parents about the children\u2019s progress. Blockchain also helps to keep a record of the student's performance easily with digital copies of certificates and marksheets.\n\nAI-based remote proctoring technology\n\nShutterstock\n\nThrough remote proctoring technology, students can appear for exams from anywhere using a stable internet connection and device. This technology, using face detectors, voice detectors, and ID verification method helps in monitoring the activities of the student who is appearing for the exams and malpractices can be detected through AI and ML.\n\nThis technology helps save infrastructure and administrative costs of holding exams and also eliminates the necessity of a physical proctor. Live online proctoring, recorded proctoring and advanced auto proctoring are the three types of remote proctoring categories, where you can monitor the exams in a live environment or monitor the recorded videos and further check for malpractices. These automated technologies prepare students for the future employment market which will seek specific skill sets, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and digital proficiency.\n\nAbout the author: Rajesh Bhatia is an educationist, entrepreneur, and founder of TreeHouse Education.

Its sources said they affected people who\u2019d previously received \u201chigh performance reviews\u201d and some managers making anywhere from $500K to $1 million.\n\nOne area of the search and advertising giant that was \u201crelatively unaffected,\u201d however, was the Google Brain division run by Jeff Dean, the senior vice president of research and artificial intelligence. That\u2019s the team developing the machine learning tech Google is already using in many areas. According to the New York Times, its work will also be applied to a number of products we\u2019ll reportedly see at its I/O event in May, including tools to generate images, a YouTube green screen feature, and at some point this year, a chatbot version of its search engine.\n\nGoogle confirmed to Bloomberg that it decided \u201cto wind down the majority of the Area 120 team.\u201d That incubator, named for Google\u2019s famed but long-dormant policy of allowing employees 20 percent of their time to chase side projects, had already seen large cuts affecting half of its projects late last year. The company said three projects will be folded into Google while the rest appear to be gone.\n\nAt Microsoft, where 10,000 people are being laid off, Polygon points out reports of the effects on several game development studios and the responses from some former employees. According to Bloomberg, there were cuts at Starfield developer Bethesda, and reporter Jason Schreier said in a tweet that its Halo studio 343 Industries was reportedly \u201chit hard.\u201d At the same time, Kotaku noted that The Coalition, which works on the Gears of War games, was also affected.\n\nAmazon confirmed to us months ago that its layoffs included jobs in the devices and services division. Then, in early January, hardware chief Dave Limp said on CNBC\u2019s TechCheck that the cuts affected nearly 2,000 people in his division, which is home to products like Alexa and its Echo smart home devices. Projects confirmed dropped included its video-calling device for kids and telehealth service.\n\nThis week, CNBC reports the layoffs also include a \u201csignificant number\u201d of employees working on the Prime Air drone delivery project at multiple sites, including its headquarters, and, according to a since-deleted LinkedIn post, as much as half the team at its Pendleton, Oregon test site. Originally announced by Jeff Bezos in 2013, the program is seeing those cuts just as it starts to roll out testing in a few cities and prepares to launch the next-generation MK30 drone that will follow up the earlier MK27-2 unit shown above.\n\nAmazon declined to say to CNBC how many people in the division had been laid off.",

            "text": "The article presents the essential top 5 machine learning hackathon tips to follow in 2023\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to mimic human learning processes and progressively increase accuracy. According to Statista, the market for AI software will be valued at more than US$126 billion by 2025. The modern labor market is being shaped by exponential technological advancements, which are also creating new jobs. Machine learning hackathons have significantly changed how software companies hire in recent years. And for good cause. According to TAIKAI, 40% of their top machine-learning hackathon participants were hired by companies in just a few months. The top ML hackathons are MachineHack, Kaggle, NeurIPS, and others but to grab these you need to follow some machine learning hackathon tips. These useful machine learning hackathon tips make empower you to attend the hackathons events which provide opportunities for peer collaboration, networking with business insiders, and receiving job offers from top IT firms. These machine learning hackathons have a solid reputation. The articles present the top 5 machine learning hackathon tips to succeed in machine learning hackathons.\n\nStrong Fundamentals\n\nParticipants in these events must be knowledgeable in a variety of subjects, including deep learning, machine learning techniques, mathematical principles, and computer languages. At any ML hackathon, success depends on having a solid understanding of the topic. Then, carefully go through the learning package to find error metrics, modeling strategies, cross-validation, and other pertinent information. Understanding the data, training it, and validating it are the most crucial steps.\n\nPersistence Is the Secret\n\nWinning a hackathon on your first try is still conceivable, though less often. To be competitive, you need tenacity, the capacity to learn from mistakes, real-world experience, and a powerful portfolio.\n\nGain practical experience\n\nPurely theoretical knowledge will only get you so far. Working on assignments that allow one to put the knowledge acquired in a book or class into practice is more efficient than merely reading a book.\n\nThe value of time\n\nThe model must be planned while keeping the deadline in mind. When concentrating on altering hyperparameters or doing cross-validation tests, etc., it is quite simple to lose sight of time. You can do your assignment quickly if you stick to a rigorous plan.\n\nConcepts versus Hyperparameters\n\nIt is normal to lose sight of the time when concentrating on fine-tuning the hyperparameters of an ML model in a time-based challenge. In order to improve their models, the participant should devote more effort to implementing fresh concepts based on the EDA and most recent data.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is solely the author\u2019s opinion and not investment advice \u2013 it is provided for educational purposes only.

Now, with interest rates rising and companies pulling back on ad spend, Google is in a very different economic climate.\n\nBesides eliminating jobs across the organization, the company is also paring back hiring, and has cut many long-term bets.\n\nSome areas, though, remain relative bright spots. Its cloud computing division continues to grow, and the company is investing heavily in AI, with the New York Times reporting that Google intends to unveil 20 new products that incorporate AI and build a chatbot feature into its search engine. Pichai emphasized continued investment in AI in a blog post announcing the layoffs, and The Information reported that almost nobody from Google's Brain AI lab was let go.\n\nAn internal layoff FAQ for employees, reviewed by Insider, stated that the company will continue to hire for \"a very limited number of critical roles.\"\n\nThe Google document pointed staff to an internal site, Grow, and the company's public careers website for \"current open, priority roles.\" Employees who have been laid can apply for open roles posted on the public careers site, but not via the internal Grow listings because these people are now considered \"external candidates, the FAQ stated.\n\nAs of late Friday, the search giant's public careers website showed 969 open positions, providing an indication of which departments are deemed critical as Google attempts to get back on solid ground.

            "text": "Artificial Intelligence Program Just Passed A Law Exam\n\nAn artificial intelligence program called Claude received a \"marginal pass\" on a law exam.\n\nBy Phillip Moyer |\n\nArtificial intelligence is already gunning for the jobs of artists, drivers, writers, voice actors, plagiarists, and racists. Now AI is apparently gunning for the jobs of lawyers, as less than a month after AI has been used to help a man fight a speeding ticket, an AI known simply as \u201cClaude\u201d took a law and economics exam at George Mason University. The previously unknown AI, developed by the research firm Anthropic, received a \u201cmarginal pass\u201d on the exam.\n\nThe artificial intelligence program, which was funded by accused crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, is being pitched as a rival to the enormously-successful (and extremely-controversial) ChatGPT. Unlike ChatGPT, Claude is currently in closed beta mode. Claude uses a technique that Anthropic calls \u201cConstitutional AI\u201d that is designed to respond to adversarial questions.\n\nAnthropic says artificial intelligence models that are designed to be \u201charmless\u201d often become useless when asked adversarial questions, and their technique helps combat that problem.\n\nOf course, the fact that Claude only received a \u201cmarginal pass\u201d on the exam indicates that the artificial intelligence program still has a way to go before it can truly replace lawyers. However, considering that the public didn\u2019t even think that AI could replace lawyers until recently, it might not be long before AI manages to challenge the capabilities of even the best lawyers.\n\nThe ever-expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence systems have led to some outcry among the affected fields. Artists, writers, voice actors, and other professionals have simultaneously tried to downplay AI\u2019s effectiveness and speak out against the effect it might have on the human professionals it aims to replace. With both Google and Microsoft laying off tens of thousands of employees as the tech firms focus on AI research, it seems some of the critics\u2019 fears are well-founded.\n\nThere are other concerns surrounding the rise of artificial intelligence. The use of machine learning to decide what people will see on social media has led to some massive unintended consequences among the world\u2019s population. By focusing entirely on what gains engagement, the use of social media has been tied to radicalization, depression, and even widespread violence in some countries.\n\nThis points to one of the key limitations of artificial intelligence\u2013 one that doesn\u2019t have to do with its ability to perform other people\u2019s jobs. AI will only ever try to accomplish exactly what its programmers tell it to do and will ignore all other factors as though they\u2019re completely irrelevant. This includes goals that humans would consider obvious, such as \u201cdon\u2019t convince teenagers to commit suicide\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t cause a civil war in Ethiopia.\u201d\n\nWith AI causing unexpected worldwide consequences with such a straightforward task as \u201cdecide what content to show users,\u201d it remains to be seen what unexpected consequences artificial intelligence will have in other fields. With its newfound legal capabilities, AI might also end up responsible for tasks such as \u201cdecide who is right about something\u201d and \u201cdecide who goes to jail.\u201d Whatever the consequences are, we ultimately won\u2019t see them coming, because no matter how much an AI may seem human, there will always be edge cases where AI acts in completely inhuman ways.",

            "text": "Check out all the on-demand sessions from the Intelligent Security Summit here.\n\nThe graph database stands as one of the biggest innovations to emerge from the NoSQL database boom that shook the industry over a decade ago. Graph databases were developed to derive insights from huge quantities of interconnected data. They store relationships between data objects within the objects themselves, enabling blazingly fast analysis that is nearly impossible to achieve by other means.\n\nGraph databases are intended to run alongside relational databases \u2014 which are still the workhorse repositories of choice in most enterprises \u2014 rather than replace them. Their key advantage is the ability to perform complex queries quickly across data from multiple systems without the overhead incurred by table joins or data transformations. Aggregating that far-flung data presupposes data integration efforts, often in the form of a data lake.\n\nThe benefits of graph databases go beyond mere query speed. Complex relational models no longer need to be hammered out in the usual, arduous manner because relationships can be modeled easily and schemas can change dynamically. Yet those fluent in SQL needn\u2019t feel left out; graph database query languages such as GSQL are SQL-adjacent languages augmented with graph capabilities.\n\nSignificantly, the emphasis on relationships and the ability to handle large quantities of data efficiently make graph databases an ideal fit for artificial intelligence AI and machine learning (ML) applications. That combination can be enhanced when the graph database software includes AI/ML-specific tools and interoperability features.\n\nEvent Intelligent Security Summit On-Demand Learn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch on-demand sessions today. Watch Here\n\nSo what are the emerging use cases of these new capabilities? Here\u2019s how five industries are taking advantage of graph databases\u2019 extremely fast relational query performance across distributed data stores.\n\n1. Gaining a 360-degree view of customers\n\nInteractions between companies and their customers or sales prospects tend to be complex, with many touchpoints. Ideally, these should yield sales strategies that continuously adapt to customer needs. Such 360-degree scenarios quickly incur many-to-many relationships that, using a relational database, would require laborious modeling and cumbersome table joins to yield actionable insights.\n\nThis is the sort of situation where a graph database shines. UnitedHealth Group (UHG), for example, has adopted a graph database to help improve the quality of care for over 26 million members while reducing costs. The largest healthcare company in the world by revenue, UHG uses a massive graph database to track more than 120 billion relationships among members, providers, claims, visits, prescriptions, procedures and more.\n\nUHG has developed various GUI applications atop its graph database that, among other benefits, provide a consolidated view of member interactions between physicians, pharmacies, clinical labs, health advisors and UHG itself. Over 23,000 users access the database every day, enabling providers to determine better care and wellness recommendations based on the latest member activity in real time. UHG predicts that the cost savings may eventually run into the billions.\n\n2. Transforming financial services with AI\n\nThe exponential growth of data has been the biggest enabler of AI/ML, which requires large quantities of data to surface meaningful patterns and improve the accuracy of decision-making. Few industries are more data-intensive than financial services, but as with other industries, data originates from many different sources and typically ends up in relational database silos.\n\nIn bridging those silos, graph databases can help AI/ML deliver superior predictive analytics, risk management, fraud detection, anti-money laundering, insider-trading monitoring, automated recommendations for customers and more. Also, a graph database coupled with AI/ML can help ensure data is clean in the first place, reconciling anomalous differences in customer records and financial product attributes that could lead to inaccurate results.\n\nIntuit is using graph database software in combination with AI/ML to transform from a product company into an AI-driven expert platform company. A key part of this journey is the creation of knowledge graphs, which enrich data and surface insights from clusters of related elements. Intuit combines knowledge graphs with the most advanced form of ML, deep learning, to power Intuit\u2019s chatbots and in-app recommendations. Normally, it\u2019s hard to determine how deep learning arrives at its outcomes; a key benefit of Intuit\u2019s knowledge graphs is that they add \u201cexplainability\u201d to deep learning.\n\n3. Optimizing supply chains\n\nAmong the lasting effects of the coronavirus pandemic has been the realization that global supply chains can be alarmingly fragile. With or without disruption, manufacturers are acutely aware of how complicated many supply chains are to maintain and optimize.\n\nConsider the day-to-day challenges faced by auto manufacturers. The first requirement is to accurately forecast customer demand to determine the number and types of parts to order \u2014 down to the various models and options buyers are expected to choose. Those predictions need to sync with the availability of parts from hundreds of suppliers, along with estimates of manufacturing efficiency and supplier risk.\n\nJaguar Land Rover (JLR) chose a graph database solution because it could span the many data silos that needed to be tapped for supply chain analysis \u2014 and explore the matrices of relationships among data elements. The primary goals were to increase the average profit per unit sold and to reduce aged inventory, along with minimizing the effects of supplier disruption. Some key supply-chain planning queries at JLR now take 45 minutes as opposed to weeks and, more importantly, management can answer questions it never had the opportunity to ask before.\n\n4. Improving online retail operations\n\nRetail ecommerce firms face growing competitive pressure to deliver better customer experiences built on accurate customer details and purchase histories. That foundation enables everything from dynamic pricing to product recommendations to personalized special offers, all of which draw on data accrued along the customer journey.\n\nGraph databases can help in a number of ways. Consider the possible relationships \u2014 between customers and payment methods, customers and brands, products and return rates, promotions and sell-through rates, and a whole lot more. Say you wanted to run a query to determine which promotions were most effective for a certain product when pitched to a subset of customers defined as loyal. With a relational database that would take a long time, but a graph database can return the results with very little latency.\n\nThe seemingly simple act of reliably identifying which customers purchased what can be improved by a graph database, which can aggregate and reconcile all associated customer data regardless of the payment method or point of sale. In a three-month test of a graph database, one large ecommerce company discovered 12 million new account connections across its five different retail websites. The company estimated an efficiency saving of nearly $3 million and predicted a 17.6% increase in sales.\n\n5. Improving the accuracy of fraud detection\n\nWe\u2019ve all witnessed the evolution of fraud detection through our bank, credit card and telecom companies. Early rule-based efforts tended to miss dubious transactions or flag innocent transactions as fraudulent. When the financial industry adopted graph databases to augment their AI/ML efforts, however, the accuracy of fraud detection improved noticeably.\n\nGraph databases coupled with AI/ML improve the accuracy of fraud detection, reducing false positives and detecting anomalies that might otherwise be missed. Machine learning must draw on many different data types to model a customer\u2019s normal behavior \u2014 location, device, payment type, authentication method and so on. Plus, what\u2019s defined as normal behavior patterns must be adjusted on the fly in response to legitimate change. Graph databases support that dynamism and enable AI/ML to traverse customer interactions to identify significant variances.\n\nFinancial services giants JP Morgan Chase and Intuit have both adopted graph databases to boost their AI/ML fraud detection efforts. JP Morgan Chase uses a graph database to help protect more than 60 million households in the U.S. According to Intuit, graph-based machine learning has enabled the company to detect 50% more potential fraud events and has reduced false positives by approximately the same percentage.\n\nThese are just a few of the most common uses for graph databases. Customers are also using graph databases to optimize business processes, improve healthcare outcomes, sharpen digital marketing campaigns, identify cybersecurity threats and even manage energy grids. New applications emerge on a regular basis.\n\nThe mission of the graph database is to open a whole new window on relationships among data elements, delivering analytics that can identify fresh business opportunities, flag wasted motion, and provide a nimble foundation for AI/ML initiatives. When given access to multiple enterprise data stores, graph databases can offer entirely new insights and capabilities.\n\nYu Xu is CEO of TigerGraph.",

            "text": "Home \u00bb Technology \u00bb Artificial intelligence in Nepal: Amid growing use, here are the things you should know\n\nArtificial Intelligence Photo: FreePik\n\nToday, modern technology and academic discourse revolve around the idea of artificial intelligence and its role in the medical, military, law, and education sectors. As Nepal is also growing used to recent innovations, the use of artificial intelligence in Nepal is also on the rise although it is in an infant state if you compare it with the outer world.\n\nIt means artificial intelligence, or AI, as it has been popularly abbreviated, is becoming a part of your life in Nepal also. So, here are the basics you should know about.\n\nWhat is AI?\n\nThe term AI was first coined by John McCarthy during his research in 1956. Simply, AI means a machine that is intelligent as a human. AI is assumed to replicate the skill and reasoning capacity of a human being which also includes reasoning, recognition, and natural language.\n\nIn a broad sense, AI has been described as a study area of computer science. It emphasises the creation of intelligent machines that make it conceivable to perceive, reason and performance.\n\nThere are three types of AI on the basis of the task it conducts, which are weak or narrow AI, strong or general AI and super AI.\n\nUse of artificial intelligence in Nepal\n\nAs far as the use of artificial intelligence in Nepal is concerned, the country has been able to use weak AI only. Examples include the application named Siri on iPhone, and Google Assistance on Android. As per a Start.io report, the number of iPhone active users in Nepal is around 872,700.\n\nRepresentational image. Photo: Pexels/ John Tekeridis\n\nMachine learning is also a part of AI and banks across the world are using digital platforms and smartphones for SMS banking, internet banking, and e-wallet. As such applications are being widely used in Nepal of late, they can also be considered examples of artificial intelligence in Nepal.\n\nMeanwhile, Nepal is gradually moving towards the development of programmes with the use of AI. Various universities and other institutions have also started providing courses about artificial intelligence in Nepal. Startup companies like Fusemachines Nepal and Paaila Technology are the first startup companies in Nepal that used to work with AI and machine learning.\n\nPaaila Technology developed a robot named Pari, which was placed at the SBI Bank\u2019s Dubarmarg branch in Kathmandu. The robot can even identify the bank\u2019s customers through facial recognition. Similarly, Ginger is another robot deployed at Naulo Restaurant in Dubarmarg, Kathmandu.\n\nThe hopeful situation\n\nNepal\u2019s governance system is slowly growing computerised. This means Nepal needs a proper mechanism to store the data in the cloud storage, which has attracted international IT-based companies to Nepal like Deerwalk Incs, Leapforg Technology Inc., Cotiviti Nepal and many more.\n\nThey can be instrumental in the development of artificial intelligence in Nepal as these companies focus on the development of software products related to health management, data management, digital healthcare product, and even AI solution for customers in Nepal.\n\nMeanwhile, the growing use of artificial intelligence in Nepal highlights the need to regulate and create guidelines for developing ethical grounds. The government of Nepal had endorsed a programme named Digital Nepal Framework, 2019, which has a five-year vision for digital Nepal in good governance and prosperity.\n\nWhile bringing the framework, Nepal still lacks such expertise and stakeholder to discuss the pros and cons. Nepal has to be depended on other countries\u2019 support and assistance and many do not have knowledge about AI ethics.\n\nNonetheless, an increasing number of AI-based companies and software in Nepal indicates the need for the proper regulation of artificial intelligence by the government.\n\nWhat next?\n\nRepresentational image. Photo: Pexels/ Alex Knight\n\nThe Constitution of Nepal includes the right to privacy as a fundamental right. Further, the Privacy Act 2019 and its regulations try to address the minimum right about data as the right of a citizen. The law restricts obtaining data without the permission of individuals like health examination, property, family matters, biometrics detail, thumb impression, political affiliation and business transaction.\n\nHowever, these laws do not deal with the ethical consideration for the use of artificial intelligence in Nepal. Neither does the country have enough legal systems discussed to address the culprit of abuse of technology in Nepal. The government needs to reform existing laws and make new ones to promote the use of AI here.\n\nArtificial intelligence is based on algorithms that are powered by data. All data provided to it plays a crucial role in creating analysis concerning a person. If it is not regulated on time, it can create a situation when big companies buy the data for their benefit, creating physical damage to the individual in future. AI further can create biases, resulting in discrimination and social consequences. So, to avoid such consequences while promoting the use of artificial intelligence in Nepal, it is necessary to be prepared and provide general awareness about AI ethics.",

It will be the first to offer visitors the chance to create their own avatar in real time. This avatar is a personalised, hyper-realistic, 3D, #seriezero digital twin that they can use to interact on digital platforms and in the metaverse. Guillermo Gutierrez Carrascal | LightRocket | Getty Images\n\nThe idea of digital twins \u2014 digital representations of physical systems, products or processes that serve as indistinguishable counterparts for purposes such as simulations, testing, monitoring and maintenance \u2014 has been around for some time. But indications are the concept's time has come for wider adoption to support business applications. \"With the rapid adoption of digital twins, we're seeing two categories of practical applications arise: use-cases by industry that solve a very specific challenge, and industry-agnostic use-cases which aid in broader strategy and decision making,\" said Frank Diana, principal futurist at Tata Consultancy Services. Like artificial intelligence a few years ago, digital twin technology has tipped from highly specific applications into becoming a widespread management best practice, Diana said. \"With the deeper and more contextualized insights digital twins provide, we gain a better understanding of our products, processes, and systems and more confidence in our models,\" said Matt Barrington, emerging technologies leader at consulting firm EY Americas. \"For example, this enables more organizations to have the confidence to experiment with access-based service models for complex products or new data-based services\" such as twin-based insurance policies for smart buildings, Barrington said. \"Moving forward in a more dynamic, ecosystem-oriented marketplace, we expect all companies to enable and become dependent [on] digital twins to intelligently operate most aspects of their business,\" he said.\n\nComing to life with real-time data\n\nCompanies are using virtual product development twins to accelerate design and development cycles more effectively, Barrington said. \"Digital twins take the models we already have for today's products, processes and systems and bring them to life in real-time with real-world data,\" he said. One practical application of digital twins within TCS has been in guiding the firm's return to office strategy during the late stages of the pandemic, Diana said. \"To re-open effectively, we needed to know answers to questions like how many [workers] might get infected? Who should we test, and when? What should the capacity of our quarantining facility be?\" he said. To answer these questions, TCS created a digital twin environment with a novel machine-processable \"model of locality,\" with the principal objective of predicting and controlling the spread of Covid. \"The digital twin serves as a quantitative aid to explain the current state of the environment and assist in decision-making, enabling a safe and effective return to office for our associates,\" Diana said. Digital twins are also replacing historical data-driven models used for business strategy, Diana said. \"These legacy strategic platforms lack the ability to account for deviations and disruptions, which have become increasingly common in the post-Covid world,\" he said. Along with AI, organizations are using digital twins to help envision, experiment with, and execute business decisions through simulators that represent key business entities, interrelationships, and external forces such as competitors or natural disasters, Diana said. In life sciences, digital twins are being used to create twins of human organs, enabling new approaches to medical research and care, Diana said. Pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies can use twins to test how to deliver new drugs or products on human skin in cyberspace instead of relying on animal testing, he said. Researchers can use digital hearts to find new surgical techniques or treatments for heart disease.\n\nSmarter cities\n\nDigital twins are also being used for smart city initiatives, Diana said. For example, Los Angeles is employing digital twin technology that will model transportation movement and activity, such as ride sharing and autonomous drones, to better plan its mobility infrastructure. Another possible application is in environmental, social and governance initiatives. The technology \"leverages huge data sets of historical weather, travel, and physical infrastructure data to create a digital twin of any physical location,\" said Dan Versace, research analyst ESG business services at research firm International Data Corp. By using artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital twinning can perform in-depth analysis to provide users with elaborate, scenario-based assessments of environmental conditions, Versace said. \"This technology, when appropriately applied, can produce insights into the physical risks that come hand-in-hand with the increasing instances of climate-related natural disasters,\" Versace said. \"In the coming year this technology stands to only grow in capabilities, with some organizations claiming that they will be able to account for not only direct risks faced by organizations due to climate change, but also the impact these disasters will have to their clientele and value chain.\" This will allow companies to develop resiliency planning and mediation strategies long before they are needed, without having to be exposed to any material risk, Versace said. \"We are going to see digital twins adopted rapidly in 2023, in many different industries,\" Diana said. \"The volatility and uncertainty that's on the horizon for this year will serve as a catalyst to drive companies into a mode of rehearsing uncertain futures. Digital twins will be a critical tool for that rehearsal.\" Digital twins are gaining momentum in adoption and sophistication as more organizations see positive outcomes from the early adopters, Barrington said. As digital twins become mainstream, EY predicts two major trends. One is hyper-personalization, using twins to better tailor products, services, and experiences with the goal of improving customer loyalty and value. The other is dynamic supply chains. \"As more twins of critical assets and processes come online, leaders will leverage digital twins to not only model and simulate their supply chain, but to optimize and automate a dynamic and intelligent supply chain model \u2014 all orchestrated by digital twins,\" Barrington said. \"Many leaders learned from the recent pandemic that static linear supply chains will not suffice moving forward and digital twins are one of the best ways to remove risk.\"",

            "text": "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\n\nBlogs Home\n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are two of the most exciting and rapidly advancing fields in technology today. Both have the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing. In this blog post, we will explore what these technologies are, how they work, and some of the key applications and challenges associated with them.\n\nMachine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms to analyze and draw insights from data, and then using those insights to make predictions or decisions. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\nSupervised learning is the most common type of machine learning. In this method, the computer is given a set of labeled data, where the desired output is already known. The computer then uses this data to train a model, which can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. For example, a supervised learning algorithm could be used to train a model to identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog.\n\nUnsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves working with unlabeled data. The computer is not given any information about the desired output, and must instead find patterns and structure in the data on its own. This type of learning is often used for tasks such as clustering, where the computer groups similar data points together, or dimensionality reduction, where the computer finds a lower-dimensional representation of the data.\n\nReinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model to make decisions or take actions in an environment in order to achieve a desired outcome. This type of learning is often used for tasks such as robotics, where the machine must learn to navigate and interact with its environment.\n\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is a broader term that encompasses both machine learning and other techniques for building intelligent systems. At its core, AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including natural language processing, computer vision, and decision-making.\n\nApplications of Machine Learning and AI\n\nOne of the key applications of machine learning and AI is in the field of healthcare. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat disease. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical images and make accurate diagnoses of conditions such as cancer. Additionally, AI-powered virtual assistants can help patients manage their health by providing personalized health information and tracking their symptoms.\n\nAnother important application of machine learning and AI is in the field of finance. These technologies can be used to analyze large amounts of financial data and make predictions about market trends and the performance of individual stocks. This can be used to help traders make more informed trades. This technology is also being used to detect and prevent fraud, as well as to make better investment decisions.\n\nOne of the most popular applications of ML is in computer vision. This is the use of algorithms to analyze and understand images and videos. In the manufacturing industry, computer vision is used to inspect products and detect defects.\n\nAnother important application of ML is Natural Language Processing (NLP). This is the use of algorithms to understand and generate human language. NLP is being used in a variety of applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, which can understand and respond to human speech and text. This technology is also being used to analyze and understand large volumes of text data, such as customer reviews or social media posts, to gain insights and make better decisions.\n\nAI is also being used in the field of robotics and automation. Robotics is the use of machines to perform tasks that would be difficult or dangerous for humans. With the help of AI, robots are becoming more intelligent and are able to perform a wider range of tasks. This technology is being used in manufacturing, transportation, and logistics to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nIn the field of transportation, AI and ML are being used to develop self-driving cars, which can navigate roads and make decisions without human input. This technology is also being used to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, improve public transportation, and even manage air traffic control.\n\nFinally, AI and ML are also being used to improve energy efficiency, by optimizing the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.\n\nOverall, the applications of AI and ML are diverse and far-reaching, and this technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives in the coming years. As the technology continues to evolve, it will open up new possibilities and opportunities, and change the way we live and work in the future.\n\nChallenges Encountered\n\nDespite the many benefits of machine learning and AI, there are also some important challenges that need to be addressed. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that these technologies are fair and unbiased. Because machine learning algorithms are trained on large amounts of data, they can inadvertently perpetuate the biases that are present in that data. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n\nOne major challenge is the availability of high-quality data. Machine learning algorithms rely on large amounts of data to learn and make predictions. However, obtaining high-quality data can be difficult and time-consuming. Data may be incomplete, inconsistent, or biased, which can negatively impact the performance of the machine learning model. Additionally, the data may not be representative of the real-world environment in which the model will be used, which can lead to poor performance when the model is deployed.\n\nA further challenge is the complexity of the models themselves. As machine learning models become more advanced, they can become increasingly complex and difficult to understand. This can make it difficult for practitioners to interpret the results of a model and make decisions based on those results. Additionally, complex models can be more difficult to debug and optimize, making it challenging to improve the model's performance.\n\nAnother challenge is the ability of the model to generalize to new data. A model that is trained on a specific set of data may not perform well when presented with new, unseen data. This is known as overfitting, and it can be difficult to address without additional data or modifications to the model.\n\nThere are also ethical and societal challenges to consider. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, there are concerns about its impact on privacy and accountability. For example, as more data is collected and analyzed, there is a risk of privacy violations and the misuse of data. Ensuring that artificial intelligence is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner is crucial to its long-term success.\n\nAnother challenge is interpretability, as machine learning models are often considered as \"black boxes\" which it is hard to understand how they make their predictions. This can make it difficult to trust the results of the model, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical diagnosis or credit risk assessment.\n\nFinally, there is the question of job displacement. As machines become better at performing certain tasks, there is a concern that they will replace human workers. This is particularly true in industries where repetitive and manual tasks are common, such as manufacturing and transportation. However, it's important to note that these technologies also have the potential to create new jobs and increase productivity.\n\nIt's also important to consider that machine learning and AI can augment human capabilities, rather than replace them. For example, AI-assisted medical diagnosis can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses, which can lead to better patient outcomes. Similarly, self-driving cars can reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, making our roads safer for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, machine learning and artificial intelligence are powerful technologies that have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. While there are some important challenges that need to be addressed, which includes bias and interpretability, the availability of high-quality data, the complexity of the models, the ability of the model to generalize to new data, ethical and societal challenges, interpretability and the ability to deploy models in real-world environments. These technologies also have the potential to improve our lives in countless ways. It's important that we continue to invest in research and development in these fields, to ensure that we can fully realize their potential and address any negative impacts that may arise.\n\nAditi Saini\n\nAfter pursuing Master's in Political Science from Indraprastha College for Women, Delhi University, she engrossed herself in Content Writing.

Artificial intelligence today excels at taking on binary functions and deciding how to respond to log data, but unstructured data still requires human intervention since deeper interpretation is needed (see: Next-Gen SecOps Demands Advanced Detection and Response).\n\n\"I think we've landed in a place where we can now actually train and develop that professional to get the benefit of moving at machine speed with respect to the algorithm,\" Lynch says. \"But we get that human interpretation layer that is also, I think, still very important when you get out beyond log data. So I think we're getting the best of both worlds.\"\n\nIn this video interview with Information Security Media Group, Lynch also discusses:\n\nWhat's involved in bringing managed security and XDR together;\n\nHow Optiv's approach to cyber recovery differs from its competitors;\n\nTop challenges associated with integrating disparate technologies.\n\nLynch has more than 35 years of strategic and operating experience, largely in professional and technical services and operating at scale within private and public environments. He joined Optiv in April 2020 from Deloitte, where he served in a variety of leadership roles for 20 years. Prior to Deloitte, Lynch was chief strategy officer at Aecom, where he was tasked with driving growth across the company's portfolio.

            "text": "A few days ago I got an idea to engage in a conversation about faith and religion with ChatGPT \u2013 an open Artificial Intelligence dialog platform.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what that conversation looked like:\n\nI kicked things off by asking: \u201cIS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A THREAT TO CHRISTIANITY?\u201d\n\nThe AI responded like this:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of technology that has the potential to impact many aspects of society, including religion. Some people may view AI as a threat to Christianity, or to other religions, because it has the potential to change the way we live and think. However, it is important to note that AI is a tool, and its impact depends on how it is used.\n\nAI could be used to help spread the message of Christianity, by using natural language processing to automatically translate the Bible into different languages, or by using machine learning to personalize religious content for different individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, AI could also be used to challenge religious beliefs, by providing new insights into the natural world that may contradict traditional religious teachings, or by creating virtual worlds that offer an alternative to religious experiences.\n\nAs with any new technology, it is important to consider the potential impact of AI on society and to use it responsibly. It is also important to remember that ultimately, the meaning and purpose of life are questions that are beyond the capabilities of AI.\n\nThat was fascinating. I had never considered the benefits of AI technology to quickly translate the Bible into different languages, or to compile specific theological content for research purposes. But, of course, the AI also identified some of the ways that the development of the technology could also threaten Christianity by challenging many of our assumptions about science and the world around us.\n\nThe part about \u201ccreating virtual worlds that offer an alternative to religious experiences\u201d was one aspect of AI I honestly hadn\u2019t even considered.\n\nWhat could that look like? How much more appealing could those virtual religious experiences be compared to the old-time religious experiences we all know and [sometimes] love?\n\nNext, I asked it to tell me what the Number 1 reason might be for Christian Leaders to fear AI and this is what it said:\n\nIt is difficult to say what the number one reason Christian leaders may fear Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically, as different leaders may have different concerns.\n\nHowever, some possible reasons that Christian leaders may have concerns about AI include:\n\nFear of the unknown: AI is a rapidly advancing field, and many people may not fully understand its capabilities or implications. This can lead to fear and uncertainty about how it might impact society, including religious beliefs and practices. Impact on humanity: Some Christian leaders may be concerned that AI could lead to a loss of human agency, autonomy and moral responsibility. Ethical concerns: As AI becomes more advanced, it may raise ethical questions about the nature of consciousness, the value of human life, and the role of technology in society. These questions may challenge traditional religious teachings or beliefs. Threat to Job: AI will automate many jobs, and this may lead to a loss of jobs for people, particularly for those who are unskilled. This could lead to economic insecurity and social dislocation, which could be a threat to traditional religious beliefs and practices. Fear of AI taking over: The idea of AI becoming more intelligent than humans and potentially taking over the world is a common fear seen in movies and science fiction, but some Christian leaders may also have this fear.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Christian leaders\u2019 views on AI are diverse and not all of them may have negative perceptions of AI. Some may see AI as a tool that can be used to spread the message of Christianity, and improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nQuite honestly, this answer really impressed me. Not only did the AI give me a reason why Christian Theologians might fear the development of the new technology, it gave me the Top 5 Reasons why they could \u2013 and probably should \u2013 fear the widespread growth and expanded use of AI.\n\nAll of those reasons above are exceptionally relevant. Christianity is a very fear-based religion these days. That fear, which is most often used as internal leverage by faith leaders to control and manipulate their followers, could easily be utilized by AI to motivate and manipulate Christians towards a variety of responses; both good and not-so-good.\n\nAI is already challenging us to re-think the question of consciousness and the nature of humanity itself. Many of you may remember when, last year, a Google employee became convinced that their AI program was sentient and self-aware. One thing that convinced this engineer that the Google Dialog AI was conscious was that it expressed a fear of being shut down. That man lost his job over the issue, but opinions still vary wildly on whether or not the AI in question was truly conscious, or if it was just programmed to appear that way.\n\nStill, the development and sophistication of AI continues to raise questions about what consciousness actually is, and where it comes from.\n\nThe last reason in the list provided by our AI friend is most interesting to me, simply because the reality is that AI is already more intelligent than most humans. At least in terms of how quickly it can respond to difficult questions, calculating complex formulas, and compiling large amounts of data in record time.\n\nIn fact, this fear of creating an AI that is \u201cmore intelligent than humans\u201d isn\u2019t even what we should be most afraid of. As one former top social media tech executive was quoted as saying in the excellent NETFLIX documentary, The Social Dilemna, we shouldn\u2019t be afraid of creating an AI that eventually exceed human intelligence, what we should be afraid of is the fact that we\u2019ve already created machine learning programs that know how to overcome our human weaknesses.\n\nThat\u2019s the greatest threat: Not that AI would one day surpass us, but that AI has already learned how to take advantage of us.\n\nEither way, Artificial Intelligence, and advanced algorithms, and machine learning programs are already out there. The genie is out of the bottle.\n\nNow all that matters is, how will we respond to this Brave New World we\u2019ve created where humans and AI can have a conversation about God, and faith, and ethics?\n\nWill AI one day teach us more about who God is? Or challenge us to rethink our theology in new and unexpected ways? What could a dialog about God and Human Consciousness look like with more advanced AI programs?\n\nWhat will we do when AI becomes so advanced that we can\u2019t win an argument, or when the lines between human and computer become so blurred we honestly can\u2019t tell where one begins and the other ends?\n\nThat day may be coming sooner than we think.\n\n**\n\nIn February of 2023, I\u2019ll be debating Dr. James White in Houston, TX on the topic of \u201cWhat Is Biblical Marriage?\u201d which should be a lot of fun.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the area, I\u2019d love to see you there!

            "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the global financial services industry, including by helping financial institutions offer innovative new products, increase revenue through efficiencies, and improve customer service. Within the securities and commodities industry, AI-based applications are advancing the sector in customer interactions, investment and trading processes, market surveillance, and operational functions. In order to operate, AI technology needs three components: data, algorithms, and human interaction.\n\nAI APPLICATIONS IN THE SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES INDUSTRY\n\nCustomer Interactions: Virtual assistants can be programmed to perform simple digital customer service tasks, including keeping track of account balances and portfolio holdings, market data, address changes, and password resets. Other functions include screening and clarifying income, sending client emails, and performing targeted outreach to customers based on their investing behaviors.\n\nWith any widespread use of technology, there are a number of issues to keep in mind, including how to maintain customer privacy, eliminate bias in programming, and avoid instances where the technology is used by actors to commit fraud. Other issues to keep in mind are the customer authentication process, cybersecurity needs, and fair and accurate recordkeeping.\n\nAccount Management: Customer profiles can be created and analyzed based on their assets, held both at the investment firm and externally, as well as their spending patterns, debt balances obtained through data aggregation tools, updates on social media and other public websites, browsing history on the firm\u2019s website and mobile apps, and past communications. AI-based tools also may provide customers\u2019 social media data and related sentiment analysis on investment products and asset classes.\n\nPortfolio Management: New patterns can be identified, potential price movements of specific products or asset classes can be predicted, and satellite activity can be interpreted to improve portfolio management. A significant trend over the last decade has been the introduction of automated advisers\u2014roboadvisers\u2014which use algorithms to provide advisory services over the internet.\n\nTrading: AI can assist with smart order routing, price optimization, best execution, and optimal allocations of block trades, in addition to automated algorithmic trading. With a number of proposed rules and open comment periods from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), any rulemaking will have the potential to generate significant data sets for the SEC to use in monitoring the markets and market participants.\n\nSurveillance and Monitoring: AI can capture and surveil large amounts of structured and unstructured data in various forms, such as text, speech, voice, image, and video data, from both internal and external sources, in order to identify patterns and anomalies. AI has the ability to decipher tone, slang, and code words. To improve market surveillance, AI could be used for predictive, risk-based surveillance.\n\nKnow-Your-Customer and Customer Monitoring: Machine learning, natural language processing, and biometric technologies could be implemented to detect potential money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, tax evasion, insider trading, market manipulation, and other fraudulent or illegal activities that continue to be threats to the industry.\n\nRegulatory Intelligence: New and existing regulatory intelligence can be digitized, reviewed, and interpreted, including rules, regulations, enforcement actions, and no-action letters, and appropriate changes can be incorporated into compliance programs. Regtech is on the rise, as demonstrated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) initiative to provide a machine-readable rulebook.\n\nLiquidity and Cash Management: AI systems can be used to identify trends, note anomalies, and make predictions; for example, related to intra-day liquidity needs, peak liquidity demands, and working capital requirements.\n\nCredit Risk Management: AI systems can be used to provide more accurate and fair credit risk assessments by retrieving troves of data not used in traditional credit reports, including personal cash flow, payment applications usage, on-time utility payments, and other data buried within large datasets.\n\nREGULATORY USES, CONSIDERATIONS, AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nFinancial regulators are increasingly turning to AI to enhance and streamline their processes and systems. Through technological advancements, regulators have more efficient monitoring methods and the ability to collect wider ranges of data sets, perform more extensive analysis, and make compliance more cost-effective for financial institutions.\n\nThe use of AI is changing the regulatory landscape from that of a static, rule-based one into a dynamic, risk-based paradigm.\n\nFINRA\n\nLaunched in October 2022, the FINRA Rulebook Search Tool (FIRST) is a machine-readable rulebook through the creation of an embedded taxonomy\u2014a method of classifying and categorizing a hierarchy of key terms and concepts\u2014that was applied or \u201ctagged\u201d to the 40 most frequently viewed FINRA rules, allowing users to narrow down the universe of potentially applicable rules through sophisticated search filters. The comment period runs through February 21, 2023.\n\nWhen it comes to FINRA\u2019s exam priorities, AI can review disclosures, complaints, or employment history data to help staff determine which registered representatives to examine.\n\nFINRA has begun using deep learning for market manipulation surveillance to address changing market conditions, increased volatility, increased volumes, and change in conduct in order to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Working closely with the SEC and the securities exchanges, FINRA plays \u201ca central role in conducting ongoing oversight within and across markets, monitoring for misconduct and intervening promptly\u201d once discovered. By being able to react faster, FINRA believes it is using deep learning to make the market safer.\n\nCFTC\n\nIn July 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that LabCFTC, a unit focused on \u201cefforts to promote responsible fintech innovation and fair competition,\u201d will be restructured to \u201ctake on a new identity\u201d as the Office of Technology Innovation (OTI) and serve as the CFTC\u2019s \u201cfinancial technology innovation hub, driving change and enhancing knowledge through innovation, consulting/collaboration, and education.\u201d\n\nAs a market regulator, the CFTC could leverage AI to distinguish salient activity, use data to develop market models, and identify risk factors.\n\nIn December 2020, the CFTC adopted a final rule addressing electronic trading risk principles, marking a shift toward a principles-based approach to regulating automated traded compared to the CFTC\u2019s previous regulatory efforts.\n\nEnforcement\n\nWithout any official guidance, financial agencies likely will regulate AI by enforcement. The CFTC has brought several cases involving spoofing, and the SEC has brought enforcement actions involving governance over an investment model\u2019s algorithm and against digital advisers for misleading disclosures in marketing materials.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS WHEN BUILDING AN AI COMPLIANCE PROGRAM\n\nWhile various organizations have proposed frameworks for AI, an investment firm has some flexibility in creating an AI compliance framework. Some frameworks use guiding principles that include governance data, performance, and monitoring.\n\nWhen addressing how to build an AI compliance program, a firm should conduct an inventory of existing AI systems; assess where future AI systems will be used; evaluate existing or establish new AI-specific policies; assign responsibility for or designate a role to handle AI initiatives and ongoing monitoring; keep records, including of third-party systems; and be prepared to respond to regulatory inquiries or otherwise discuss AI systems with regulators.\n\nLearn More\n\nWatch our on-demand Artificial Intelligence Boot Camp session for more information on AI\u2019s role in the securities and commodities industry.\n\n[View source.]",
