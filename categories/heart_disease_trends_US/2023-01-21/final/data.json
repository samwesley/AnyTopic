            "text": "An estimated 60 million people comprising one-fifth of the United States (US) population, reside in areas defined as rural.1 These individuals face numerous disparities in both health outcomes and health care access compared to those living in urban areas. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is 40% higher among rural vs urban residents, and mortality rates associated with all types of CVD and stroke are also higher in rural areas.1-3\n\nThe availability of specialists, including cardiologists, is especially sparse in the rural US, and researchers have found significant inequities between patients receiving cardiology treatment in rural vs urban hospitals.4,5 In a retrospective study published in January 2022 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Loccoh et al examined differences in outcomes between Medicare beneficiaries (n=2,182,903) presenting to rural or urban hospitals with acute cardiovascular conditions.5\n\nPatients receiving treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at rural hospitals showed lower rates of cardiac catheterization (49.7% vs 63.6%; P <.001), percutaneous coronary intervention (42.1% vs 45.7%; P <.001), and coronary artery bypass graft (9.0% vs 10.2%; P <.001) compared with those treated at urban hospitals.5\n\nAmong patients with ischemic stroke, rates of thrombolysis (3.1% vs 10.1%; P <.001) and endovascular therapy (1.8% vs 3.6%; P <.001) were also lower at rural vs urban hospitals.5\n\nIn addition, 30-day mortality was higher among rural vs urban patients with AMI (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12), heart failure (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16), and ischemic stroke (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.18-1.22) after adjustment for demographic factors and comorbidities. The most pronounced differences in mortality were observed among patients receiving treatment at critical access hospitals in remote rural areas.5\n\nRelated Content\n\n\u201c Access to cardiology care, like other types of health care, is determined by many different factors including the supply of health care providers, availability of emergency departments and hospitals, as well as health insurance coverage.\n\nImproving cardiology care and outcomes in the rural US will require a range of efforts from various stakeholders. \u201cGovernmental or health care systems that incentivize physician practices in these areas are needed \u2013 such as programs that pay down student loans and provide loan forgiveness, for example,\u201d Deirdre Mattina, MD, FACC, general cardiologist in the section of regional cardiovascular medicine at the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, told Cardiology Advisor.\n\nAdditionally, she noted, \u201cMedicaid services are often reimbursed at lower rates than commercial insurance plans, which creates disparities in health care delivery by disincentivizing physicians to offer care to this vulnerable population.\u201d\n\nAlong with better reimbursement models and programs that provide benefits to physicians practicing in underserved locations including the rural US, the further integration of telehealth into cardiology practices is needed to provide a \u201cbridge to infrequent in-person care,\u201d Dr Mattina said.6\n\nTo learn more about these regional disparities in access to cardiology care, we interviewed Laxmi Mehta, MD, clinical professor of internal medicine and section director of preventative cardiology and women\u2019s cardiovascular health at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus; Sameed Khatana MD, MPH, senior fellow and assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and staff cardiologist at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center; and Basera Sabharwal, MD, chief cardiology fellow at Mount Sinai Morningside in New York.\n\nWhat factors are driving the shortage in access to cardiology care in the rural US?\n\nDr Mehta: Transportation issues including lack of vehicle access, long travel distances, high costs of transportation, and inadequate infrastructure in transportation means can contribute to poor access to care. Rural hospitals are often designated as critical access hospitals, which are typically smaller and have less capacity for intensive care or rehabilitation services. As rural hospitals continue to close nationwide, access is even more challenging for rural patients. Furthermore, workforce shortages also impact staffing in rural areas and in turn limit access to adequate care. High rates of uninsurance amongst rural populations also result in financial strain and impact access to care.\n\nDr Khatana: Access to cardiology care, like other types of health care, is determined by many different factors including the supply of health care providers, availability of emergency departments and hospitals, as well as health insurance coverage. The number of physicians in rural areas has been declining for decades. Rural hospitals have also been closing at a greater rate than urban hospitals due to factors such as low reimbursement, staffing shortages, and low patient volume. Additionally, we know that many states with large rural populations in the South and Midwest have not expanded Medicaid health insurance, therefore depriving many rural low-income individuals of health insurance.\n\nDr Sabharwal: Battling health care disparities between rural and urban areas has been ongoing for over a decade now. In general, life expectancy in urban populations is about 3 to 4 years higher than in rural areas, with some indigenous populations having a life expectancy that is 5 to 6 years lower than people living in urban areas.1 Multiple factors are responsible for this, including higher rates of common but treatable risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol.\n\nAnother primary reason for health care disparities is social determinants of health including income, education, employment, housing, distance from a health care center, transportation, food insecurity, and limited or no health insurance. All of these factors, as well as scarcity of primary care providers for screening and treatment of common conditions like high blood pressure, and less favorable mental and behavioral health care availability, lead to an increase CVD and stroke.\n\nRegarding acute care, distance to a hospital center is extremely important. On average, rural residents live more than 10 miles from a hospital, which is twice as far than those living in urban locations. Moreover, hospitals in rural areas see a lower volume of complex and critical diseases, leading to lack of experience in these areas and thus differential disease outcomes between urban and rural hospitals. This gap becomes even wider for complex CVDs. Health practitioners in urban areas are super-specialized, and the high volumes they deal with lead to improved health metrics of those diseases. On the other hand, care in rural areas is less specialized and practitioners practice more widely.\n\nData shows that less than 10% of US physicians practice in rural areas, and even fewer have more specialized training.7 Health care centers including both clinics and hospitals are finding it tougher to retain specialized physicians in these communities. There\u2019s even a shortage of nurses and support staff in these regions, which adds tremendously to the problem.\n\nWhat are some of the measures needed to help reduce these gaps?\n\nDr Mehta: New models and site of care delivery are essential, including expanding telehealth services and digital technology, as well as training of the entire care team so that community health care workers and other care team members can provide care and expand access for patients. Flexible payment and funding models are necessary to support rural delivery of care. Expanding affordable health care insurance may also be impactful.\n\nDr Khatana: Shoring up the financial health of rural hospitals so that they can continue to operate is an important step. In Pennsylvania, the state is testing a model called the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model, which will provide hospitals with a \u201cglobal budget\u201d in which CMS and other participating health insurance payers will pay certain rural hospitals a fixed amount of money to cover all costs of hospital-based care. The goal of this program is to provide more predictable finances to rural hospitals.8\n\nAdditionally, training programs need to be set up in rural areas with a focus on providing for the needs of rural programs. Expanding the scope of practice of advanced practice providers such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants to provide cardiovascular care may also address the issue of the shortage of providers.\n\nDr Sabharwal: Access to health care has changed in the last few years with the rise in telehealth since the pandemic began. This is extremely important and useful, especially in rural areas where long distance travel for routine care is a barrier. With telehealth, these patients can get regular screening, monitoring, and treatment of diseases including CVDs, and they must travel to specialized centers only when necessary. If we can improve primary prevention of heart disease by treating the risk factors, there will be less heart disease requiring treatment. This requires routine health checks and follow-ups, which can be easily done via telehealth.\n\nAnother helpful measure would be to include mandatory rotations in rural outreach centers during residency and fellowship training. This will increase care at those centers with a probable increase in physicians ultimately staying at those practices.9\n\nOther measures would be to make rural practices more attractive to physicians at the end of their training, such as through loan forgiveness programs to those willing to work in rural areas, or by combining practices with urban centers wherein physicians agreeing to practice with the majority of their time in rural centers are still able to rotate monthly or every 3 months, for example, through urban centers with exposure to complex diseases.\n\nChurches and other faith-based organizations are cornerstones of rural communities. Collaboration with these organizations for routine health care workshops with cardiologists and other specialists from urban areas would improve care provided in rural populations. Economic development in rural areas as well as improvement in insurance availability for policies like Medicaid would also decrease the health care disparity gap between rural and urban areas.\n\nWhat are your recommendations for clinicians interested in providing and advocating for increased access to cardiology care in rural areas?\n\nDr Mehta: Clinicians should work on expanding their virtual care of patients and be creative in utilizing technology to address health equity. Development of a diverse workforce that incorporates people with differing training will help expand the reach of care for rural patients. Community education is mandatory regarding cardiovascular risk factors, and healthy lifestyle may be beneficial in improving overall cardiovascular health.\n\nThe AHA is committed to bringing equitable care to rural communities through its Rural Health Care Outcomes Accelerator, which includes the Get with the Guidelines Quality Program at no cost for rural hospitals, as well as access to participate in rural learning collaboratives and access to the AHA\u2019s Lifelong Learning Center.11\n\nDr Khatana: Clinicians interested in providing care in rural areas need to form connections with providers already in these areas. Specialty care, including cardiology, is hard to access, so having formal and informal relationships with rural health care providers can help.\n\nClinicians can also advocate to health system leaders to partner with rural hospitals to help coordinate necessary cardiovascular care when needed. They should also advocate for the expansion of health insurance coverage for low-income patients in rural areas in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid health insurance.\n\nDr Sabharwal: Caring for these medically underserved patients can be challenging. For those interested in providing cardiovascular care in this high-risk population, they should begin in their early years of training so they can understand the needs of the community and learn to navigate their practice and the system to provide optimal care in these areas. There are multiple organizations within the health care system that are focusing on such efforts, including the American Heart Association (AHA) as well as community groups. Getting involved with such organizations will help achieve the goal of improving cardiovascular care in these communities.\n\nWhat are remaining research needs regarding this topic?\n\nDr Mehta: Research is necessary to determine optimal delivery of care models, including how best to leverage digital technology. Research on effective rural-based quality measures and how to best support community-centered approaches to care is also needed.\n\nDr Khatana: Unanswered questions include whether improving the finances of rural hospitals will prevent such hospitals from closing. A study by my colleagues and I, published in JAMA in 2021, showed that cardiovascular health was associated with economic prosperity of an area.10 Future research needs to study whether improving the economic prospects of an area can lead to improvement in health outcomes, including for CVD.\n\nDr Sabharwal: Health care centers in rural areas lack patient volume and quality metrics. Some metrics require a large sample size to be reliable. These 2 factors combined make data from rural centers difficult to interpret. Further research in this area is needed to better understand the needs of rural communities. In addition, research to analyze how telemedicine performs in these populations would help to better strategize care in these communities.",

            "summary": "\n\nSummary: A recent study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology has revealed disparities between patients receiving cardiology treatment in rural vs urban hospitals. Results showed that cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft rates were lower at rural than urban hospitals, with increased mortality observed among those treated at critical access hospitals in remote rural areas. Access to cardiology care is determined by many factors including transportation issues, workforce shortages, health insurance coverage and financial strain; new models for site of care delivery are needed along with flexible payment and funding models and expansion of affordable health care insurance. Further research on improving economic prospects to lead to improvement in health outcomes is also necessary."

            "text": "You\u2019re more likely to die of heart disease than anything else, partly because, well, if nothing else gets you, your heart will give out. And a heart attack could cost you upwards of $760,000 these days, when you consider hospital charges, prescription drugs, additional care for the rest of your life, and then indirect costs like loss of time at work.\n\nUp to 80 percent of premature heart disease can be prevented simply by the adoption of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding tobacco. In 1999, The Lyon Heart Study demonstrated that a change of diet could lead to 70 percent less heart disease\u2014about three times the reduction in risk achieved with statins\u2014and a 45 percent reduction in death rate.\n\nBut the state keeps throwing vast quantities of public funds at statins, despite years of mounting evidence that they do not reduce all-cause mortality in patients who have not had a heart attack already. As for stents and coronary bypass surgery, prevention is better than cure.\n\nA major problem with the government colonization of healthcare is that, while people certainly don\u2019t like the government telling them to put down the corn chips or get off the sofa for a run around the block, they sure like free treatment. Once the \u201cright to be treated\u201d becomes the accepted norm, paying for preventable diseases makes sense, and then becomes an approach backed by a coalition of medical lobbyists and willing patients.\n\nThere is a prevailing cultural view that people are not capable or willing to make lifestyle changes or take better care of their health, and it certainly suits the medical industry for people to believe this as it allows them to sell endless numbers of statins, stents, and perform costly operations like bypass surgery. But we have some case studies proving that, with the right support, people can take better care of themselves.\n\nIn Ribera, New Mexico, a private company was licensed to deliver the government-provided healthcare. To keep costs down (and turn a profit), it provided lots of active, preventative care to keep people away from hospitals.\n\nFor example, the hospital took note of who would come in with chronic bronchitis in the winter, and then contacted them the following October offering them a visit. If they were suffering from poor health, they were given preventative treatment making them less likely to end up in the hospital later, saving money and a traumatic trip to the emergency department on a cold winter night. They also monitored people with known heart conditions to offer early treatment and consequently managed to admit a staggering half as many heart attacks as in the past.\n\nIn 1995, Duke University Medical Center instituted a program to prevent congestive heart failure, which was the most common diagnosis leading to hospitalization among the elderly. Nurses would call heart failure patients at home to check on their breathing and make sure they were taking the right medication properly. Nutritionists helped patients improve their diets. Doctors shared information about them and came up with new ways to improve care. The number of hospital admissions for congestive heart failure at Duke declined, and patients who were admitted spent less time at the hospital, bringing the costs down for insurers by 37 percent.\n\nOne would think with such astonishing results to boast, programs like these would have become commonplace in the two and a half decades since. But they haven\u2019t. And under the current system they likely won\u2019t because Duke lost money as a consequence of the program.\n\nIn a free market there would be a huge incentive for companies to find innovative ways to prevent the $760,000 waste on a preventable heart attack and to help people realize the benefits of greater health. People love being fit. They love being able to run around with their kids on their back without getting out of breath and being able to roll around with their partners without getting exhausted.\n\nBut so long as government funds continue to prop up the \u201cfirefighting\u201d model of healthcare, where we wait until people get really sick and then treat them with expensive drugs and surgery, we are unlikely to see the emergence of many \u201cfire prevention\u201d programs.\n\nTHIS ARTICLE ORIGINALLY POSTED HERE.",

About 20.1 million adults aged 20 and older have coronary heart disease, and every year, about 805,000 people in the U.S. have a heart attack.\n\nProducts recall to hinder the market pace\n\nIncreasing number of product recalls by regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to hinder the market growth. For instance, on December 27, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled Daptomycin for Injection 500 mg/vial and Daptomycin for Injection 350 mg/vial, used for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cassis) caused by susceptible isolates of the Gram-positive bacteria. The Daptomycin for Injection 500 mg/vial and Daptomycin for Injection 350 mg/vial was manufactured by Accord Healthcare Inc., a pharmaceutical company. The product was recalled due to product mixed up.\n\nMarket Trends -:\n\nAdoption of growth strategies by market players to augment the market size\n\nIncreasing number of organic strategies, such as market authorization by the regulatory bodies, offers growth opportunities for players in the advanced drug delivery systems market. For instance, on December 02, 2022, GSK plc., a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, announced that European Medicine Agency had validated market authorization application (MAA) for momelotinib, an oral treatment for myelofibrosis. The validation was based on results from key phase III trials, which met all primary and key secondary endpoints, including Total Symptom Score (TSS), Transfusion Independence (TI) rate and Splenic Response Rate (SRR). Thus, the increasing market authorization by the regulatory bodies is expected to boost the growth of advanced global advanced drug delivery systems market.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nOn December 20, 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company, announced that it had received approval in Japan for Breyanzi, a CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, used in treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The approval was based on results according to which Breyanzi demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant improvement in the primary endpoints of event-free survival (EFS) [HR: 0.349 95% CI: 0.229-0.530, p0.0001] and progression-free survival (PFS) [HR: 0.406 (95% CI: 0.250-0.659), p = 0.0001] in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nOn November 18, 2022, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, a global specialty generic pharmaceutical company, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) had approved SEZABY (phenobarbital sodium powder for injection) for the treatment of neonatal seizures. The approval was based on results, according to which the randomized controlled trial compared the incidence of recurrent seizures in neonates treated with phenobarbital vs. levetiracetam in 94 neonates. Twenty-four hours following the administration of phenobarbital or levetiracetam, 73% vs. 25% were seizure-free in the respective groups.\n\nOn December 21, 2022, Sanofi, a pharmaceutical and healthcare company, released findings from a successful Phase 3 trial demonstrating that adults and adolescents receiving Dupixent (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly saw improvements in the signs and symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Patients receiving Dupixent weekly experienced improvement in the ability to swallow and achieved histological disease remission.\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a healthcare company, announced the approval of AJOVY, subcutaneous Injection 225 mg, used for preventive treatment of migraine in Japan. AJOVY is a subcutaneous injection of anti-CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology. CGRP is believed to play an important role in migraine attacks. Ajovy targets CGRP ligand and inhibits binding to the CGRP receptor.\n\nKey Market Takeaways:\n\nThe global advanced drug delivery systems market is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 5.0% during the forecast period. For market players in advanced drug delivery systems, an increase in research and development efforts is anticipated to provide attractive growth prospects. For instance, in September 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a biopharmaceutical company, announced the results of phase III clinical trial, of Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt), for the treatment of anemia due to very low-, low- or intermediate-risk (IPSS-R) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in patients who are red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent. The results met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI) with concurrent hemoglobin (Hb) increase in the first-line treatment of adult patients with very low-, low- or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who require RBC transfusions.\n\nAmong type, Oral drug delivery system segment is dominant in the U.S. due to the factor that key players are focused on approval of products by regulatory bodies. For instance, on December 12, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Radicava ORS (edaravone) oral suspension for the treatment of adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The efficacy of Radicaba ORS is based on studies that have shown levels of Radicaba ORS in the bloodstream to be comparable with those of an IV formulation of Radicaba.\n\nOn the basis of application, cardiovascular diseases segment in Asia Pacific is expected to hold a dominant position over the forecast period due to an increasing smoking rate and increase in risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. For instance, in June 2021, a review article was published by ScienceDirect, according to which cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the leading cause of death in Asia due to an increase in the smoking rate by the Asian people. Among 39 Asian countries, smoking prevalence is over 30% in 8 countries and more than 20% in 29 countries. However, because male population have much higher smoking rates than female population in Asian countries, estimates of combined smoking rates may underestimate the problem of smoking among men.\n\nCompetitive Landscape:\n\nKey players operating in the global advanced drug delivery systems market include Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Sanofi, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Celgene Corporation, Boston Scientific, GSK plc., Baxter International, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, Astrazeneca, Astellas Pharma, Exela Pharma Sciences, LLC, Intas Pharmaceuticals, 3M Company, Abbott Laboratories, and Bayer Healthcare, among others\n\nBuy-Now this Research Report @ https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/buy-now/5243\n\nMarket Segmentation:\n\nGlobal Advanced Drug Delivery Systems Market, By Type: Oral Drug Delivery System Injection-Based Drug Delivery System Inhalation/Pulmonary Drug Delivery System Transdermal Drug Delivery System Transmucosal Drug Delivery System Carrier Based Drug Delivery System Others\n\nGlobal Advanced Drug Delivery Systems Market, By Application: Cardiovascular Diseases Oncology Urology Diabetes CNS Ophthalmology Inflammatory diseases Infections Others\n\nGlobal Advanced Drug Delivery Systems Market, By Technology: Prodrug Implants and Intrauterine Devices Targeted Drug Delivery Polymeric Drug Delivery Others\n\nGlobal Advanced Drug Delivery Systems Market, By Geography: North America By Country U.S. Canada Latin America By Country Brazil Mexico Argentina Rest of Latin America Europe By Country Germany U.K. France Italy Spain Russia Rest of Europe Asia Pacific By Country China India Japan Australia South Korea ASEAN Rest of Asia Pacific Middle East By Country GCC Israel Rest of Middle East Africa By Region/Country South Africa Central Africa North Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Market Intelligence Reports:\n\nNeurofeedback Systems Market, By Application (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Pain Management, Insomnia, Anxiety Disorder, and Other Diseases) and By Geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and South America)- Size, Share, Outlook, and Opportunity Analysis, 2022 \u2013 2028\n\nElectrophysiology Devices Market, by Product Type (Electrophysiology Monitoring Devices (Electrocardiograph, Holter Monitoring Devices, X-Ray Systems, Combo systems- Imaging and 3D mapping systems, Diagnostic Electrophysiology Catheters) Electrophysiology Treatment Devices (Implantable Cardioveter Defibrillators, Pacemakers, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices, Catheters)), by Indication (Atrial Fibrillation, Atrioventricular Nodal Re-entry Tachycardia, Supraventricular Tachycardia, Bradycardia, Others (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, etc.)) by End User (Hospitals, Diagnostic Centers, Clinics, and Others (Ambulatory Surgical Centers, etc.)), and by Region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa)- Size, Share, Outlook, and Opportunity Analysis, 2022 \u2013 2030\n\nOrthopedic Power Tools Market, by Product Type (Large Bone Orthopedic Power tools, Small Bone Orthopedic Power tools, High Speed Bone Orthopedic Power tools, Orthopedic Reamers), by Technology (Electric Powered Systems, Battery Operated Powered Systems, Pneumatic Powered System), by End User (Orthopedic Hospitals, Orthopedic Clinics, Ambulatory Surgical Centers), and by Region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa)- Size, Share, Outlook, and Opportunity Analysis, 2022 - 2030\n\nAbout Us:\n\nCoherent Market Insights is a global market intelligence and consulting organization focused on assisting our plethora of clients achieve transformational growth by helping them make critical business decisions.

The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the average American's life expectancy at birth was 77.0 years in 2020. Life expectancy for men was 74.2 and the life expectancy for women was 79.9 in 2020.\n\nThe growing prevalence of various chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, respiratory problems, renal disorders, among others in the country requiring effective treatment and diagnosis is expected to drive the growth of United States Hospital Market during the forecast period.\n\nThe National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) body of CDC collects data on chronic diseases across United States. According to Centres for Disease and Control and Prevention, chronic disease has been reported as the leading driver of the United States' USD4.1 trillion in annual healthcare cost. 6 out of 10 people of the country is suffering from chronic disease and 4 among 10 people have more than two types of chronic diseases.\n\nThe top three reasons of death among the population of United States includes, heart disease and stroke, cancer, and diabetes. The heart disease related death tolls for one third of the total death among the population which cost the health care system USD216 billion per year. The increasing disease burden has led to an increase in the number of walk-in patients which seeks for better care facilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides, increasing healthcare expenditure coupled with growing awareness related to early disease diagnosis and treatment is further expected to create lucrative opportunities for the market growth. Furthermore, improving healthcare infrastructure in the country is further supporting the market growth.\n\nIncreasing Number of Surgeries\n\nThe country's healthcare spending is increasing quickly as the number of patients rises, which will benefit country's hospital market growth overall. The number of surgeries done in the United States has significantly increased over time. A NCBI study estimates that around 40-50 million surgical procedures are carried out every year in the nation. According to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. health care spending climbed 9.7% reached $4.1 trillion in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, nearly 40 million inpatient surgical procedures, followed closely by 31.5 million outpatient surgeries, were carried out in the United States, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The digestive, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and ophthalmological were among the most underwent procedures in the United States.\n\nDue to the availability of expert medical staff along with presence of advanced equipment & facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases in the hospital settings is expected to increase the demand for hospital services, thereby driving the market growth in the country.\n\nRising Cases of Accidents\n\nIn the first three months of 2022, 9,560 persons lost their lives in motor vehicle traffic accidents, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States. When compared to the 8,935 fatalities anticipated for the same period in 2021, this is an increase of nearly 7%.\n\nSince 2002, there have been fewer first-quarter fatalities than this. NHTSA reported that the mortality rate took a toll from the predicted rate of 1.25 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles in the first quarter of 2021 to 1.27 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAccording to the CDC, in 2018, there were around 130 million visits to emergency rooms, of which 35 million were attributable to injuries. The need for instant response and the availability of treatment at nearby hospitals is crucial during these circumstances, thus increasing the demand for hospitals to initiate quick response to help the people with increasing their survival rate during critical conditions.\n\nIncreasing number of Cancer Cases\n\nAccording to the Global Cancer Observatory, total number of new cancer cases reported in 2020 were around 2,281,658. Among the different types of cancer, breast and lungs cancer are two of the prominent cancers which are prevalent among the population. This has in turn increased the demand for hospitals where effective diagnosis and treatment can be availed.\n\nHospitals with advance diagnostic technologies have paved their way for easy and early detection of cancer and easy access to treatment so that people with financial problems can also get access to this long-term disease which usually charge hefty amount for treatment.\n\nIntegration of AI in the Hospitals\n\nThe advent of AI and machine learning has revolutionized the hospital industry in the United States. In order to make up for the lack of medical staff in hospitals, it helps doctors make more precise diagnoses, nurses admit patients more promptly, and pharmacists develop medications more effectively and safely.\n\nAI for record keeping in hospitals enhances the management of electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs enable for the management of patient health information in a digital format and the sharing of that data with other healthcare professionals across various organisations, increasing physician productivity and patient satisfaction. As they continue to enter the digital health business, major tech companies like Google and Apple are largely responsible for this expansion.\n\nMoreover, the hospital command centre at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which started operating in 2016, leverages predictive analytics to enable a more effective operational flow in the hospital. The hospital collaborated with GE Healthcare to build the Judy Reitz Capacity Command Center, which integrates data from `14 separate Johns Hopkins IT systems` across 22 high-resolution, touch-enabled computer monitors and can receive `500 messages per minute.` The system also identifies and reduces risk, `prioritise activity for the benefit of all patients, and activate interventions to speed patient flow.\n\nJohns Hopkins reported an improvement of 60% increase in its capacity to admit patients `with complex medical issues` from the local area and the entire country since the command centre's establishment. The hospital is now able to report faster ambulance dispatches, faster bed assignments in the emergency department increased by 30%, and 21% increment in the patient discharge before noon are some of the major improvements seen in the John Hopkins hospital.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nCompany Profiles: Detailed analysis of the major companies present in United States hospital market.\n\nHCA Healthcare, Inc.\n\nAscension Health\n\nTenet Healthcare Corporation\n\nCommunity Health Systems Inc.\n\nCatholic Health Initiatives\n\nHospital Corporation of America\n\nLifePoint Health\n\nPrime Healthcare Services\n\nUniversal Health Services, Inc.\n\nNational Surgical Hospitals, Inc.\n\nReport Scope:\n\nUnited States Hospital Market, By Ownership:\n\nPublic\n\nPrivate\n\nUnited States Hospital Market, By Type:\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecialty\n\nMulti- Specialty\n\nUnited States Hospital Market, By Type of Services:\n\nIn-Patient Services\n\nOut-Patient Services\n\nUnited States Hospital Market, By Bed Capacity:\n\nUp to 100 beds\n\n100-500 beds\n\nAbove 500 beds\n\nUnited States Hospital Market, By Region:\n\nSouth-West\n\nMid-West\n\nNorth-East\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/b56adl\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

            "text": "Latest data show more than 21,000 excess heart deaths in the last nine months - a 14 per cent rise on before the pandemic. Meanwhile, average ambulance waits for heart attack and stroke victims last month reached 93 minutes - the worst figure on record.\n\nLast week, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence issued new guidance, suggesting any patient who sought statins should be given them, in a desperate bid to tackle the growing crisis.\n\nOn Thursday, heart experts urged NHS to urgently identify those who have missed out, with advice to the public to get their blood pressure and cholesterol checked.\n\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan, an associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation and consultant cardiologist, said: \u201cYet again we\u2019re seeing clear evidence of the major disruption to healthcare people in the UK experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to limit the damage,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThese findings demonstrate how getting heart healthcare back on track can curb the additional strain that untreated risk factors such as high blood pressure would otherwise place on the NHS.\n\n\u201cWe need to make it easier and more accessible for everyone to know their numbers - particularly their blood pressure and cholesterol. This means empowering people to access the help they need when they need it so they can be supported to manage their own health.\u201d\n\nWhitty's concerns over excess deaths\n\nMedication to cut blood pressure includes ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers, while statins are most commonly prescribed to cut cholesterol.\n\nSir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, recently raised concerns that worse access to such drugs during the pandemic was fuelling thousands more deaths among the middle aged.\n\nThe latest research by scientists from Liverpool University, Strathclyde University and others, supported by the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre at Health Data Research UK was published in Nature Medicine.\n\nResearchers used data on routinely dispensed prescriptions in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nTheir estimates suggest that if those who missed out on blood pressure treatment remain untreated, there will be more than 13,500 additional cardiovascular events, with an estimated 3,474 strokes, 2,281 heart attacks and thousands more cases of heart failure and angina.\n\nScientists said that if those who missed out were identified and put on medication within the next five years, the toll could be reduced by four fifths.\n\nThe study found that by the first half of 2021, on average, 27,070 fewer people started taking blood pressure lowering medication each month, compared with 2019.\n\nDetecting risk factors early is 'crucial'\n\nBefore the pandemic, around 100,000 people a month started on such pills, statisticians said.\n\nMeanwhile, the monthly data showed 16,744 fewer people started taking medication such as statins to reduce levels of fat or cholesterol in their blood.\n\nResearchers said the study was the first use of medicines data to track changes in day-to-day management of chronic conditions.\n\nLead author Prof Reecha Sofat, from the University of Liverpool said: \u201cDespite the incredible work done by NHS staff, our data show that we\u2019re still not identifying people with cardiovascular risk factors at the same rate as we were before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cDetecting these risk factors early and beginning medication where appropriate is crucial to manage them, helping more people to avoid a preventable heart attack or stroke so they can live in good health for longer.\u201d\n\nProf Bryan Williams, chair of medicine, UCL, said the findings showed that the current model of care needs urgent review.\n\nHe said: \u201cPatients shouldn\u2019t need to visit doctors to get their blood pressure checked and their treatment dispensed, there are much better and more efficient ways of doing this that would be more convenient and more effective for patients. Perhaps that is the most important take away from this study.\u201d",

It may just be bombarded with a host of chronic diseases.\n\nCancer is the one that leads the list of Chronic Diseases others include diabetes, heart disease, arthritis etc., and the increase in Indians suffering from the same in the coming years has primarily been attributed to globalization, a growing economy, an ageing population and changing lifestyle, according to this leading oncologist.\n\nThis may be true indeed since it is a fact that our lifestyle has changed considerably in the last decade.\n\nWe have moved into a fast-paced world where everyone is vying to be at the top of the game (Job, social profiles, family, friends, etc.).\n\nIt has become a competition to be here and there and everywhere!\n\nOur very way of living has undergone a tremendous change, a change so significant that the lifestyle, food, and even leisure or on what and how we choose to spend our time has changed immensely.\n\nHence, it is not surprising that we should now have to face diseases that predominantly originate from an unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol and smoking, lack of proper exercise, and not enough sleep.\n\nChronic Diseases A Bane Of Modern Tech Age\n\nAlthough Chronic diseases have become more prevalent and costly, many are preventable.\n\nMany chronic diseases have been linked to lifestyle choices that remain within our own hands to change.\n\nHence as we move towards this change, India will face a tsunami of chronic diseases such as cancer, warned Dr. Jame Abraham, Chairman, Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, U.S.A., making it critical for India to embrace and enhance its technology-driven medical techniques to prevent health catastrophes effectively.\n\nCancer \u2013 Prevention and Treatment\n\nCancer has undoubtedly become one of the more rampant of all chronic diseases and among the six trends that will reshape cancer care in this century are\n\nCancer vaccines for prevention and treatment, expansion of Artificial Intelligence & data digital technology, and cancer diagnosis from liquid biopsies, according to the Doctor.\n\nThe other three trends are the usage of genomic profiling, the evolution of gene editing technologies and the next generation of immunotherapies and CAR T cell therapies.\n\n\u201cDigital technology, information technology and telehealth will narrow the gap between patients and specialists.\n\nThis will also improve the availability of expert care in remote parts of our country, including rural settings where the majority of our population lives.\n\nDr. Abraham also noted that India\u2019s biggest challenge would be how to make it affordable and accessible for millions of its people when these technologies continue to revolutionize cancer care.\n\nCancer A World Wide Disease\n\nGlobocan estimates that the cancer burden globally is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, which will be a 47% rise from 2020 due to demographic changes.\n\nThis may escalate by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy.\n\nAn estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths were reported worldwide in 2020.\n\nFemale Breast Cancer On The Rise\n\nThe report states that Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer. In contrast, lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast cancer (6.9%).\n\nCancer Research\n\nDr. Abraham holds that cancer vaccines are an exhilarating research area which has shown the potential to immunize people against various cancers.\n\nHe noted that researchers had developed amazingly successful mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and the fact is mRNA-based cancer treatment vaccines have been tested in small trials for more than a decade, with some promising early results.\n\n\u201cCurrently at Cleveland Clinic, our team is doing a clinical trial testing cancer vaccine in high-risk breast cancer,\u201d he says.\n\nTechnology To The Rescue\n\nHighlighting the role of cutting-edge technologies, the Doctor says computers using Artificial Intelligence (AI) can identify variations in patterns from normal to abnormal in the biopsy much more accurately than the human eye. These technologies will mandate radiologists and pathologists to be more efficient and accurate.\n\nGenetic profiling or testing at an early age to detect the abnormal gene can help detect breast and colon cancers in their earliest stage.\n\n\u201cIn a futuristic society, genomic testing will be widely used, like monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol, to identify high risks and find targeted treatments to kill cancer cells specifically. By doing testing in the population or high-risk individuals will allow doctors to intervene before the cancer happens,\u201d he says.\n\nHe further added that scans, mammograms, colonoscopies or a pap smear are currently used for a cancer diagnosis; however, it can by then become too late when the tumour is detected.\n\n\u201cHence, the treatment needs to be very aggressive. The emerging liquid biopsy technologies will help detect cancer from a drop of blood, before it can be detected by a scan or it manifests as a lump or an ulceration.\u201d\n\nGene Therapy\n\nGenome or gene editing involves research seeking to alter the genes of living organisms and use them to treat genetic or acquired diseases.\n\nGene therapy holds promise for treating cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes, haemophilia, sickle cell disease, and AIDS.\n\nAnother direction in cancer treatment is immunotherapies, which, combined with chemotherapy, have resulted in several cases\u2019 complete disappearance of tumours.\n\nIt is now a standard treatment currently in many parts of the world. Scientists are also using CAR T cell therapy, in which T cells are isolated from a patient\u2019s blood and modified in the laboratory to attack cancer cells specifically.\n\nConclusion: Dr. Abraham has ideally pointed to the fact that when we develop novel technologies to prevent and treat cancer, we still must not take our focus on cancer prevention.\n\nThe most common causes of cancers are still tobacco, alcohol, diet and infections; hence policies for tobacco and alcohol control have to be India\u2019s priority.",

The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the rising need to continuously monitor the ECG levels of patients\u2019 hearts to provide accurate analysis help improve the effectiveness of the treatments.\n\n\n\nThe growing prevalence of arrhythmia and other CVDs create demand for improved diagnostic methods.ECG systems are the most effective instruments for detecting arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm), coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, previous heart attack, and other conditions.\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), CVDs are the leading cause of death worldwide, with 17.9 million deaths caused in the world each year; moreover, 30 million people suffer from stroke every year. According to the American Heart Association, ~19.1 million people died due to CVDs globally in 2020 and 244.1 million people were living with ischemic heart disease in 2020.\n\n\n\nAs per the estimates of the center for disease control and prevention, in the US CVDs were the underlying cause of death and accounted for ~ 697,000 deaths that is 1 in every 5 deaths. Coronary Artery disease is one of the most common heart diseases killing 382,820 people in 2020 in the US, and about 20.1 million adults aged 20 and older have CAD (about 7.2%) in 2020. More than 130 million people, i.e., 45.1% of the US population, are projected to have a type of CVD by 2035. Furthermore, the European Society of Cardiology reported that atrial fibrillation is a commonly found condition in the region, and the patients suffering from atrial fibrillation are at a five-time greater risk of getting a stroke. According to the center for disease control and prevention, it is estimated that 12.1 million people in the United States will have atrial fibrillation in 2030. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high cholesterol and smoking habits are the key risk factors for heart diseases, and ~47% of people in the US suffer from one of these risk factors.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the launch of the door-to-balloon (D2B) time initiative and \u201cMission: Lifeline\u201d by the American College of Cardiology and AHA has propelled the demand from hospitals for Bluetooth-enabled, 12-lead ECG monitors and wireless solutions.Along with the increasing incidence of these problems and the need to reduce hospital stays of patients, which otherwise require a long-term care, there is a surge in demand for mobile ECG devices.\n\n\n\nMobile ECG devices are inexpensive, disposable, and easy to use as compared to traditional ECG equipment. Therefore, the rise in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and other heart-related conditions is driving mobile ECG device market growth.\n\n\n\nBased on modality, the mobile ECG devices market is segmented into handheld, pen, band, others.The handheld segment accounted for the largest market share in 2021.\n\n\n\nHowever, the band segment is expected to register the highest CAGR in the market during 2022\u20132028.Based on type, the mobile ECG devices market is bifurcated into monitoring ECG systems and diagnostics ECG systems.\n\n\n\nThe monitoring ECG systems segment led the market in 2021 and it is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.Based on end user, the mobile ECG devices market is segmented into personal users, hospitals and clinics, and ambulatory services.\n\n\n\nThe personal users segment held the largest market share in 2021 and is expected to register the highest CAGR of 5.3% during the forecast period.\n\n\n\nThe mobile ECG devices market, based on type, is bifurcated into monitoring ECG systems and diagnostics ECG systems.In 2021, the monitoring ECG systems segment held a larger share of the market.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the same segment is expected to register a higher CAGR of 5.4% during 2022 to 2028.\n\n\n\nThe mobile ECG devices market, based on end users, is segmented into personal users, hospitals and clinics, and ambulatory services.The personal users segment held the largest share of the market in 2021.\n\n\n\nAlso, the personal users segment is anticipated to register the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period.\n\n\n\nNorth America accounted for largest market share during the 2022-2028 due to the factors such as increasing incidence of heart diseases including CVD, stroke and others, presence of well-developed healthcare infrastructure, government support.In addition, the growing incidences of heart disease and its risk have led to the growth of the market indirectly.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States, Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups. As per the given facts, in every 36 seconds, one person dies from cardiovascular disease, and 1 in every 4 deaths is because of heart disease, i.e., approximately 655,000 Americans die from heart disease each year.

            "text": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The \"Global Viscosupplementation Market, Size, Global Forecast 2023-2028, Industry Trends, Growth, Impact of Inflation, Opportunity Company Analysis\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nGlobal Viscosupplementation Market is expected to reach US$ 6.27 Billion by 2028 according to the publisher. Patients with osteoarthritis have a minimally invasive therapeutic option called viscosupplementation.\n\nDuring viscosupplementation, hyaluronic acid is pushed into the joints. The synovial fluid that covers joints contains hyaluronic acid, a substance that occurs naturally. It lubricates joints to allow bones to move freely and lessen discomfort. Hyaluronic acid levels in the joints are lower in those with osteoarthritis, which causes pain.\n\nAccording to the research findings, Worldwide Viscosupplementation market was US$ 3.71 Billion in 2022.\n\nGlobal Viscosupplementation Market will grow with 9.14% CAGR during the forecast period:\n\nThe increase in the incidence of osteoarthritis, the rise in the geriatric population, and the hike in the number of product launches and product approvals are the main factors driving the growth of the global viscosupplementation market size. One of the most prevalent types of arthritis is osteoarthritis.\n\nIn 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 32.5 million Americans (1 in 7 adults) had osteoarthritis. Due to an increase in chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, the prevalence of osteoarthritis has reached alarming levels. Additionally, a lack of physical activity, such as exercise, increases the requirement for osteoarthritis treatment for the knee and hip and propels market expansion.\n\nSingle Injection Viscosupplementation holds the lion's share\n\nBy procedure, the Viscosupplementation market is divided into three segments, i.e., Single Injection Viscosupplementation, Three Injection Viscosupplementation, and Five Injections Viscosupplementation. Among all, Single Injection dominates the current viscosupplementation market. The demand for outpatient surgeries that offer same-day surgical care, including preventive (surgical) and diagnostic procedures, is driving the Single Injections Segment. Furthermore, an increase in product launches and focus on developing single injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis are expected to contribute to the significant growth of the single-injection market over the forecast period.\n\nBy Application: The Knee Osteoarthritis Segment dominates the Market Share\n\nDue to the increased prevalence of knee osteoarthritis and the growing geriatric population, who are more vulnerable to knee osteoarthritis, the knee osteoarthritis segment dominated the Viscosupplementation market and is anticipated to maintain this trend over the projected period. In addition, the ageing effect, which reduces the amount of water in cartilage and further reduces its capacity to absorb shock and cushion, makes the elderly population more susceptible to developing knee osteoarthritis.\n\nOrthopedic clinics/Ambulatory Surgical Centers Segment is growing at a Significant Growth Rate\n\nBy End users, the Viscosupplementation market is segmented into Hospitals and Orthopedic clinics/Ambulatory Surgical Centers. Outpatient service sites, particularly those that provide ambulatory surgery and physician office-based treatments, have grown into fierce competitors for hospitals due to the recent adoption of value-based care. Orthopedic clinics/Ambulatory Surgical Centers offer both practical and financial benefits, such as quicker patient access, more affordable prices, more opportunities for physician involvement, and outpatient facilities. Hence they acquire a dominant market share in the Viscosupplementation market.\n\nBy Region: North America and Asia Pacific holds a Significant Market Share\n\nNorth America occupies a dominant position in the global viscosupplementation market. The factors contributing to the growth of viscosupplementation in the North American region are the increased prevalence of osteoarthritis and related ailments, the ageing population, the well-established healthcare system, and the rising desire for non-surgical procedures. Furthermore, Asia Pacific is expected to grow with a notable growth rate during the forecast period due to the increase in the geriatric population and rising healthcare expenditures.\n\nMarket Segmentation\n\nProduct\n\n1.

It involves an abnormal thickening of the ventricular walls, which can lead to an obstruction of blood flow through the left ventricle. HCM causes symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting and palpitations. Treatment options vary depending on the severity of symptoms and progression of the disease, but can include medications, lifestyle changes and surgery.\n\nRequest Free Sample Copy (To Understand the Complete Structure of this Report [Summary + TOC]) @ https://www.emergenresearch.com/request-sample/1545\n\nThe global obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) market is expected to oversee a constant positive growth during the forecast period. The growth of the market is driven by increasing prevalence of HCM, technological advancements in diagnosis and treatment, rising healthcare expenditure, growing awareness about cardiovascular diseases, and favorable government policies.\n\nIncrease in prevalence of cardiovascular disorders and rising geriatric population worldwide is expected to drive the Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) market. According to a study conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2017, around 610,000 people in the United States died due to heart diseases. This indicates the serious nature of cardiovascular disease and is expected to drive the HCM market.\n\nIncreasing awareness about HCM in developing nations, due to their rising disposable income, which allows them to access medical treatments and facilities that diagnose the condition is likely to fuel the growth of the Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) market.\n\nEmergen Research is Offering Limited Time Discount (Grab a Copy at Discounted Price Now)@ https://www.emergenresearch.com/request-discount/1545\n\nSome Key Highlights From the Report:\n\nMajor players in the HCM market are focusing on developing new diagnostic tools such as echocardiography and electrocardiography. Companies are also investing heavily in research and development to develop more effective treatments for HCM. For instance, Abbott Laboratories is developing a diagnostic test that can detect the genetic mutation associated with HCM.\n\nThe companies are focusing on product launches, acquisitions and collaborations to gain competitive advantage in the market. For instance, in April 2020, Ncardia launched a comprehensive drug discovery platform for therapeutic research in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The platform is based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human cardiomyocytes and provides researchers with high-throughput screening tools to accelerate their HCM drug discovery programs.\n\nMoreover, companies are also focusing on collaborations to strengthen their presence in the market. For instance, in January 2020, ReqMed entered into an exclusive collaboration agreement with Japan\u2019s GeneQuest for the development of new therapies for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Under the collaboration, GeneQuest will be responsible for the development and commercialization of potential therapies for HCM in Japan. This collaboration is expected to expand ReqMed\u2019s reach, enabling it to introduce its products and services in new markets.\n\nThe rising number of clinical trials for the development of novel drugs and therapies is another factor driving the growth of the HCM market. For instance, in 2019, a company named Allergan entered into an agreement with CardioKinetix Inc., to develop and commercialize Ventricular Restoration Therapy (VRT), an investigational device designed to restore normal cardiac function in patients suffering from HCM.\n\nThe Beta adrenergic blocking agents accounted for largest revenue share in the global Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy market in 2021 due to the increasing prevalence of HCM and the rising use of these agents as a therapeutic option. Beta blockers are competitive inhibitors of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta 1 or beta 2) which regulate heart rate, contractility, cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. These drugs have been found to be effective in reducing the symptoms of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy including chest pain, palpitations and dyspnea.\n\nThe Hospital segment accounted for largest revenue share in the global Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy market in 2021 due to increasing prevalence of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the growing need for efficient management of patient data. Moreover, growing demand for healthcare IT solutions to improve efficiency and reduce costs are further boosting the growth of this segment.\n\nThe ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) segment is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. This is attributed to the growing demand for advanced surgical procedures at low costs and improved healthcare infrastructure in developing countries. Moreover, increasing prevalence of HCM across the world is further augmenting the growth of this segment.\n\nCompetitive Terrain:\n\nThe Global Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Market is highly consolidated due to the presence of a large number of companies across this industry.
