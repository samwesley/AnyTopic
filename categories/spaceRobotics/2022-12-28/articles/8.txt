 Features include:
•	Two daisy-chainable Ethernet 100 Base-T ports. One 115kbaud RS232 port
•	Ethernet supports multiple masters and slaves. TCP/IP, UDP and Modbus TCP master protocol for communication with I/O devices
•	Encoder feedback up to 15 MHz. Quadrature standard. SSI and BiSS encoder option(SER). Sinusoidal Encoder option (DMC-31xxx). Main and auxiliary encoder inputs
•	Non-volatile memory for programs, variables, and arrays.
•	Concurrent execution of four programs.
•	Optically isolated forward and reverse limit inputs and homing inputs
•	8 uncommitted, isolated inputs and 4 isolated outputs
•	High speed position latch and output compare
•	2 uncommitted 12bit 0-5V analog inputs (16bit ±10V inputs on DMC-31xxx) and 1 uncommitted analog output
•	Standard power input is +/-12V and 5V. Controller available with optional DC-DC converter with 9-48VDC single supply input. (Option for 20-80 VDC).
