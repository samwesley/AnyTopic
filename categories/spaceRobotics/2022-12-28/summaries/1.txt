block 1: The year 2020 also made us even more determined to launch the product.We have always had intentions of joining hands with governments for government tenders and RFPs (Request For Proposal).

GenRobotic Innovations is a robotics company in India that focuses on developing robotic solutions to address social issues, such as manhole cleaning through their invention "Bandicoot". The company has faced difficulties obtaining funding and infrastructure resources but has managed to overcome them by leveraging experience and skills developed while in college. Bandicoot was well-received during the pandemic period, making GenRobotics even more determined to launch their product across government tenders and Request For Proposals.
block 2: GenRobotic Innovations started as a small startup and grew in a few months due to its successful product, Bandicoot, which changed the lives of lakhs of manual scavengers in 17 states across India.Investor recognition and support helped them venture into other areas like developing robotic rehabilitaors for paraplegics.They are now looking towards mass manufacturing their products with an aim to provide human friendly solutions worldwide.
block 3: We had to categorize our team with multiple batches, according to the field such as Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems.So, obviously this was a great challenge for us at the beginning.5.What is the impact of the pandemic on robotics?The Covid-19 pandemic has been a major trigger for robotics in India and has finally started to become mainstream technology in various industries like healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing and home care automation etc.,Robotics has been helping different sectors by providing efficient support in terms of automating processes with minimum human intervention and contact thus enhancing safety measures like social distancing during these unprecedented times where manual efforts need to be minimized so as to reduce any risk of infection spread through physical contact.In terms of business opportunities too it is providing accessibilities & alternative solutions by way making operations revolve around labour needs almost completely automated using robots thereby reducing costs associated & enabling businesses not only reaping benefits out of services provided but also becoming more cost effective while delivering quality output that can be leveraged over time using predictive analytics & AI aspect which further increase their profits margins along years while bringing down costs saving their capital amounts resulting in higher returns on investments (ROI).
6.What are the achievements of the company?Genrobotic Innovations’ Bandicoot robot was recently awarded ‘The Top 10 Indian Innovation 2020’ award from Consumer World Magazine.In addition we have won several recognitions including being selected as one among top 100 start-ups globally from UNGA+50 acceleration program under SDG 9 : Industry innovation and Infrastructure .We were also recognized with Kerala Startup Mission Awards 2019 , IDSA International Design Excellence Award(IDEA) 2018 Finalist , Dubai Future Hero Prize Winner 2016 .7.How do you look at expanding your business?As per our strategic roadmap we are currently concentrating within India market for establishing operational excellence , once established here then would go ahead with our plans towards global expansion keeping into focus United Arab Emirates and Middle East markets due its easy access towards local government funds particularly when making tie ups happen between private firms/startups - agencies partnerships leading far end scalability results eventually taking lead towards growth across both these geographies..8.What is the market size and opportunity in this sector?The overall Robotics market is expected to grow exponentially over next few years estimated worth $100 billion dollars worldwide by 2025 and growing subsequently further each year whereas India currently stands somewhere around 40 % share In comparison amongst other countries having highest demand scrounging robotic integrated technologies where majority falls under non medical application especially covered beneath Sanitation domain precisely manhole cleaning category alone deserves an attention since past decade witnessing substandard traditional measures employed involving huge human labor putting them through danger consequently generating high death tolls cases annually even until now lacking proper preventive remedies defined unit expiry date concerning life period inflicted upon particular sanitation worker within respective region conveyed above therefore giving rise tremendous potential investment invokes trending greatly onto innovative product development side hardly seen before introducing bandicoot – The Manhole Cleaning Robot back 2017 resolving those long existing issues leading toward positive effect change facing future challenges much adequately compared before eliminating entire process inclusive hazardous waste collection simply low maintenance cost easily deployable resources working tirelessly vast hours turning out highly reliable outputs often taken prior overlooking every possibility ensuring better result outcomes ultimately driving expected sales figure sky rocketing all means possible altogether considered bringing satisfiable ROI values impressive amount scale till completion timeline9
what Genrobotic Innovations offers is unique Robotic solutions designed specifically for addressing social challenges, most notably their "Bandicoot" manhole cleansing robot which helps improve safety standards for sanitation workers; they have faced many obstacles but recently won several awards including 'Top 10 Indian Innovation 2020' from Consumer World Magazine, demonstrating their tremendous growth potential moving forward
block 4: 
GenRobotic Innovations is a robotics startup with minor investment and exposure, but has been successful in changing the lives of thousands of manual scavengers through their product invention. They have achieved recognition and investments from prestigious incubators, investors and government initiatives which helped them venture into other areas to utilize robotic technology. Due to the pandemic they gained more attention as there was an increased need for sanitation activities without manual interference. The future plans include expanding their business across India and internationally by providing innovative solutions for manhole cleaning, G Gaiter for paraplegic rehabilitation patients, mass manufacturing of their products and creating an Indian Robotics ecosystem via an effective Platform.
