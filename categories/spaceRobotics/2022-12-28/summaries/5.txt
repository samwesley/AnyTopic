Rocki is a robot pet companion that comes with a 1080p HD camera, treat dispenser, laser pointer attachment, and feather attachment which allow owners to keep an eye on their pets and even interact with them when they are away. The Rocki Robot app allows users to navigate the robot using buttons on the screen and dispense treats while providing clear imaging regardless of lighting conditions. Pets love this device but its low battery life can be inconvenient for some people.
