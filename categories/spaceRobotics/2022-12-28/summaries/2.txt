block 1: Manipulators and Effectors
As we’ve already said, robots need to communicate with their surroundings for available jobs.In this situation, manipulators or effectors are involved.These enable robots to grab and move items following commands.Additionally, it lets the major robotics areas handle objects outside the network.Robots that resemble humans will have limbs that reach human hands.4. Programming
Programming is a crucial component of the critical robotics areas that we cannot neglect.The vocabulary an operator employs to speak to the machine is called programming.Historically, robot job determination was done by developers using robot programming .However, procedural programming has improved significantly in recent years..5 Perception & Sensing 
Robots utilize sensors to collect information about their surroundings .These support the robots’ ability to communicate with their environment and maintain their location .As a result, the robot can comprehend its physical surroundings and intended path.. Additionally, the robot can identify obstructions along its route using these detectors .Perception aids in the analysis of environmental data ..They work with each other to determine how t he robots will respond to th e item they encounter..Feeling and perception become crucial  maximize efficacy while protecting from malfunctions as they regulate motion & functions accurately ..

Summary: Robotics is quickly increasing in popularity due its versatility across many fields such as engineering, space exploration and residential care which require various design/programming techniques tailored for different sectors; there are 5 major robotics disciplines including human interface communication , mobility (locomotion), manipulator/effector movements & tasks , programmings(instructional commands)& sensing/perception detection for regulation accurate functioning maximizing effectiveness while avoiding malfunctions
block 2:  Effectors and Manipulators
This article discusses how effectors and manipulators enable robots to interact with their environment in order to complete tasks, as well as the importance of programming for these robots. It also examines how robotics perception and sensing technology allows them to recognize environmental data and obstacles.
