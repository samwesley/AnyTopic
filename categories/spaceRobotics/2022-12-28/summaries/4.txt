In 2022, space was a busy place with new discoveries such as the detection of water on the Moon's surface, the discovery of a rogue black hole and an international team finding the most distant object ever seen. NASA also launched its Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission to study asteroid deflection capabilities, while SpaceX fired up its Falcon Heavy rocket for its first time since 2019. Additionally, there were plenty of astrophotography successes like imaging a previously unseen population stars or supermassive black holes in HD1 galaxy and capturing some incredible images of Pillars of Creation by James Webb Space Telescope.
