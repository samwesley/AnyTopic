block 1:  Aerones, a robotics business that cleans and inspects wind turbines instead of people, has secured $38.9 million in funding from multiple investors to expand its operations in the US and other countries worldwide. The company uses remote-controlled robots to clean the towers and blades with liquid detergent then collects the contaminated liquid for reuse. It also evaluates turbine systems using ultrasonic scanners and cameras. To date, Aerones has cleaned over 5,000 turbines across 19 countries with plans to raise at least another $2.5 million in investments soon.
