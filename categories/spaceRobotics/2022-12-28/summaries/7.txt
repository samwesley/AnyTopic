 SpaceX is set to launch another batch of Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station early Wednesday, marking the 46th launch of 2020 for the company and its 196th since 2010. The company plans to have four human missions off the ground in 2023 with their flagship Falcon 9 rocket having been used for most launches this year, as well as their fourth ever Falcon Heavy rocket flight. If successful, this would be SpaceX's 68th Starlink satellite launch since 2019 when over 1 million users began using their program.
