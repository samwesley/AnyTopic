Inside the structure, robotic shuttles move in three dimensional space to store and deliver goods to workers on the perimeter that pick, pack and ship modern commerce orders.  This is said to reduce a company's warehouse space by 85%.

Addverb's fleet of automated robots, material handling technologies, and software solutions, comprises an extensive portfolio of fixed and flexible automation solutions.
