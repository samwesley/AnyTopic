Space Mouse KeyBoard shortcuts #3Dprinting #3DThursday «  Adafruit Industries – Makers, hackers, artists, designers and engineers!

PLA_parts shared this project on thingiverse! Been using the space mouse for a bit but got a little frustrated moving from moving my hand from the space mouse to the keyboard. I looked online I saw people use a stream deck but it was very pricy so I found a cheaper keypad with a great interface.
I attached the fusion 360 file so you are welcome to edit the angle
the keypad that I am using is a Vaydeer, I found it on amazon, a very useful little keypad with a great interface and quality.
I designed the keycaps custom to my shortcutsDownload files: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5539313
Every Thursday is #3dthursday here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!Have you considered building a 3D project around an Arduino or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your Raspberry Pi to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless LED projects that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
