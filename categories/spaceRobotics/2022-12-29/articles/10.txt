 Blacksburg, VA, September 8, 2021Â â VPT, Inc. (VPTÂ®), a HEICO company (NYSE:HEI.A) (NYSE:HEI), announces the availability of its SVRPL Series of space-qualified point of load DC-DC converters. Covering an input voltage range of 3.1 to 5.5 V and available in 6A output surface-mount options, the SVRPL products are designed specifically for space applications facing harsh radiation environments while requiring low voltages and tight regulation for high-performance processors. TheÂ SVRPL3R306SGÂ is based on the Intersil ISL70001ASEH radiation-hardened monolithic buck regulator. It is designed to operate from a nominal 3.3 V or 5 V bus. The SVRPL3R306SG supplies low voltages at 6 A with high efficiency, making it an ideal choice to supply point-of-load applications such as high-performance space processors. âThe SVRPL3R306SG meets the demanding needs of modern rad-hard digital electronics operating in the harshest environments under the strictest of requirements.â Said Brandon Witcher, VPTâs Principal Design Engineer. âIt features high efficiency, tight regulation, low output ripple, fast load transient response, and exceptional Single-Event Transient (SET) performance. Furthermore, it is specifically designed to meet the rigorous requirements of the latest revision of MIL-PRF-38534 Class K.â The series is characterized for Total Ionizing Dose (TID) performance, including Enhanced Low Dose Rate Sensitivity (ELDRS) and for Single Event Effects (SEE) and is operable over the full military temperature range (-55 Â°C to +125 Â°C) with no power derating, and has been submitted for qualification to MIL-PRF-38534 Class H and Class K, and Radiation Hardness Assurance (RHA) Level R. The availability of the SVRPL Series is subject to all applicable U.S. export license restrictions and regulations. Additional information can be obtained by contacting aÂ local VPT distributor.
