Homelike workspaces\u00a0 The widespread shift to remote work \u2013 and employers\u2019 subsequent attempts to bring people back to the office \u2013 has led to a design rethink.\u00a0 Expect to see more homelike or coffee shop settings with features such as plants, couches and soft seating arrangements. Workspaces will also allow people to work from different areas \u2013 for example, at a desk, at a shared table, or even outdoors \u2013 in much the same way as they would at home.\u00a0 2. Metaverse adoption\u00a0 One of the greatest potential uses for the metaverse is its ability to onboard, train, and upskill people. Therefore, it\u2019s expected that HR will be an early adopter of the technology.\u00a0 In a PwC survey, 82% of respondents expect the metaverse to be part of their business activities within three years, with onboarding and training expected to be its biggest use.\u00a0\u00a0 3. A clampdown on remote work?\u00a0 Some experts think there may be a clampdown on remote work in 2023 \u2013 especially if there\u2019s a recession. This is because employees want to \u201cbe seen\u201d in the office and help ensure job stability.\u00a0 However, remote work can help companies save money by reducing real estate costs. If a recession does occur, more firms may choose to cull their office space rather than their people.\u00a0 A lot has changed since the onset of the pandemic and remote work is now widely accepted. Either way, workers with experience and in-demand skills will continue to have the upper hand.\u00a0 4. Quiet hiring\u00a0 The latest \u2018quiet\u2019 buzzword is \u2018quiet hiring\u2019, which may replace \u2018quiet quitting\u2019 in 2023.\u00a0 Quiet quitting is based on the idea that workers are doing the bare minimum, rather than going above and beyond. This is often associated with unhappiness in their work environment.\u00a0 In contrast, quiet hiring rewards those people who do go above and beyond by giving them better job opportunities and promotions.\u00a0 This internal mobility could become a trend in 2023, especially for companies that struggle to recruit new talent.\u00a0 \nJo is Allwork.Space's Senior Editor for the UK and Europe.

Despite their enormous complexity, a view from space has become almost commonplace. Thanks to online maps, everyone equates satellite imagery to an image of the roof of your home from several kilometres up. In recent months, many will have seen satellite images from the invasion of Ukraine, supplying up-to-date images piercing the fog of war. But these mental images hide the other potentials of space imagery, and the fact that visual data is only one part of the picture. Obtaining space imagery is no longer difficult, as advances in microsatellites have opened up the imagery market. These create a wealth of space-based imagery data, which can give answers to biodiversity questions when using appropriate post-processing. Utilities are increasingly employing predictive maintenance on their power lines, meaning regular scanning and monitoring. In a recent interview with Power Technology, Marc Spieler of Nvidia claimed LiDAR and supercomputers could seed a wave of infinitely complex digital twins. But Abhishek Singh, CEO of satellite imagery analysis company AIDash, and Sashin Mishra, AIDash\u2019s head of Europe and sustainability, disagree. They told us that much more comes from above than meets the eye, and that the complexity involved in monitoring utilities, landscapes or particular environments means that space might be the only environment for accurate asset monitoring. Various satellite companies offer imagery from different angles, at different times, across different wavelengths. Singh says: \u201cSo, the visual band is just one wavelength we have available. We also have multi-spectral bands, which has bands like near infrared, shortened wave infrared, radio waves \u2026 and each different bands give us different information, and they all have different capabilities. \u201cIf we wanted to monitor flooding, then we cannot use visual bands because they cannot see through clouds. We can use synthetic aperture radar imagery to penetrate through cloud and give complete flood mapping in almost real-time.\u201d This range of processes means space-based monitoring can be used for a range of functions, both within a particular industry, or with broader environmental applications such as monitoring biodiversity. \u201cIf I have to monitor temperatures, or if there\u2019s a wildfire, I can use infrared imagery to find if there are pockets or sections on land which are hotter than others,\u201d continues Singh. \u201cTo monitor forest health, I can use multi-spectral imagery which has visual signatures, but also has other bands which tell us about the tree health. It tells us about the dryness of the vegetation, showing dying trees, dead trees, healthy trees. From there, we can start to assess the health of an ecosystem, and its biodiversity.\u201d Most areas cannot be monitored frequently, regularly, quickly or in detail without significant cost. In many applications, LiDAR offers a comparable service. For systems monitoring, particularly on power lines, space-based imagery competes with ground-based LiDAR imagery. LiDAR uses laser emitters to build 3D models of their surroundings from relatively close range. This has created increasingly large digital twins of power supply lines, such as Fugro\u2019s digital twin of Tasmania\u2019s power distribution network. In the US, various power companies use LiDAR to map their power lines, and assess their vulnerability to storms. Naturally, Singh and Mishra have criticisms of the application of LiDAR. Singh says: \u201cLiDAR data collection is both slow and expensive. You have to fly your helicopter, or drive your vehicle along the power lines, so it takes months to collect data. Once that data is collected, analysing it takes weeks or months, so by the time the analysis is made, things have changed. \u201cNo utility in the world is using LiDAR frequently on their distribution lines. The use of LiDAR is primarily limited to transmission line monitoring. In the US, it monitors less than 10% of distribution lines.\u201d Mishra continues, pointing to the environmental damage associated with LiDAR monitoring: \u201cA helicopter typically flies at around 200kph. If it covers a line in one direction, it then has to fly back, halving its effective coverage over time. That doesn\u2019t count take-off and landing. That means that, for a line of about 150km or 200km, emissions would be about one ton of carbon dioxide. \u201cIf we break down a satellite\u2019s entire life cycle, including days of operation, images captured per day, then monitoring a 150km line would emit 69g per view. Ultimately, it\u2019s self-defeating from a sustainability point-of-view.\u201d While satellites are not without environmental impact, the satellites used for image gathering are much smaller than conventional satellites. These occupy otherwise unused spaces on other, larger satellite launches, in sizes down to that of a clenched fist. While these have much shorter operating lives than larger satellites, these microsatellites arguably have small launch emissions, and no operating emissions. Biodiversity describes the variety of plants and animals within an ecosystem. Each site has its own unique considerations, but biodiversity gives a broad-brush description of humanity\u2019s impact on an area. Many sectors \u2013 construction, mining, most heavy industries \u2013 can deal significant damage to an environment, and in this context, companies will look to maintain a region\u2019s biodiversity by ensuring the environment remains unchanged once its work is complete. The variety of animal life is hard to track via any distant method. However, all animals eventually rely on plants, which can be more easily assessed, and provide a snapshot of an industrial process\u2019s impacts on an area. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about utilities, but because of biodiversity monitoring, we\u2019re seeing interest from mining companies as well,\u201d says Mishra. \u201dWe\u2019re talking to a customer who would like us to look at the forest in Mozambique, which has regulations around biodiversity. Because they\u2019ve got these regulations, we can just map their definition [of biodiversity] back into our system\u201d Mishra adds: \u201cYou require some sort of a regulatory framework to be able to determine how to measure biodiversity, and that will be based on the country you operate in. Not all countries have regulations for this, but Europe is not the only area thinking about it. \u201cLocal flora and fauna change every few hundred kilometres. How, then, do you determine whether you bringing the right biodiversity? Can you just bring in any variety of tree or animal? The answer to that is no. You have to bring in local varieties, and that\u2019s where the regulatory framework really helps.\u201d Currently, definitions of biodiversity vary between countries and companies must take care to follow local regulations. Mishra said he believes that a unified global definition for a region\u2019s biodiversity would \u201ctruly benefit the industry a lot\u201d. This would allow a worldwide fungible biodiversity market, but this concept remains far from reality at the moment. Such a market would make regular biodiversity assessments a regular part of operations, with otherwise disinterested countries able to subscribe to the scheme. The deep complexity of establishing a unified biodiversity unit cannot be understated. However, there is no reason to believe it to be entirely impossible.

Despite their enormous complexity, a view from space has become almost commonplace. Thanks to online maps, everyone equates satellite imagery to an image of the roof of your home from several kilometres up. In recent months, many will have seen satellite images from the invasion of Ukraine, supplying up-to-date images piercing the fog of war. But these mental images hide the other potentials of space imagery, and the fact that visual data is only one part of the picture. Obtaining space imagery is no longer difficult, as advances in microsatellites have opened up the imagery market. These create a wealth of space-based imagery data, which can give answers to biodiversity questions when using appropriate post-processing. Utilities are increasingly employing predictive maintenance on their power lines, meaning regular scanning and monitoring. In a recent interview with Power Technology, Marc Spieler of Nvidia claimed LiDAR and supercomputers could seed a wave of infinitely complex digital twins. But Abhishek Singh, CEO of satellite imagery analysis company AIDash, and Sashin Mishra, AIDash\u2019s head of Europe and sustainability, disagree. They told us that much more comes from above than meets the eye, and that the complexity involved in monitoring utilities, landscapes or particular environments means that space might be the only environment for accurate asset monitoring. Various satellite companies offer imagery from different angles, at different times, across different wavelengths. Singh says: \u201cSo, the visual band is just one wavelength we have available. We also have multi-spectral bands, which has bands like near infrared, shortened wave infrared, radio waves \u2026 and each different bands give us different information, and they all have different capabilities. \u201cIf we wanted to monitor flooding, then we cannot use visual bands because they cannot see through clouds. We can use synthetic aperture radar imagery to penetrate through cloud and give complete flood mapping in almost real-time.\u201d This range of processes means space-based monitoring can be used for a range of functions, both within a particular industry, or with broader environmental applications such as monitoring biodiversity. \u201cIf I have to monitor temperatures, or if there\u2019s a wildfire, I can use infrared imagery to find if there are pockets or sections on land which are hotter than others,\u201d continues Singh. \u201cTo monitor forest health, I can use multi-spectral imagery which has visual signatures, but also has other bands which tell us about the tree health. It tells us about the dryness of the vegetation, showing dying trees, dead trees, healthy trees. From there, we can start to assess the health of an ecosystem, and its biodiversity.\u201d Most areas cannot be monitored frequently, regularly, quickly or in detail without significant cost. In many applications, LiDAR offers a comparable service. For systems monitoring, particularly on power lines, space-based imagery competes with ground-based LiDAR imagery.

Despite their enormous complexity, a view from space has become almost commonplace. Thanks to online maps, everyone equates satellite imagery to an image of the roof of your home from several kilometres up. In recent months, many will have seen satellite images from the invasion of Ukraine, supplying up-to-date images piercing the fog of war. But these mental images hide the other potentials of space imagery, and the fact that visual data is only one part of the picture. Obtaining space imagery is no longer difficult, as advances in microsatellites have opened up the imagery market. These create a wealth of space-based imagery data, which can give answers to biodiversity questions when using appropriate post-processing. Utilities are increasingly employing predictive maintenance on their power lines, meaning regular scanning and monitoring. In a recent interview with Power Technology, Marc Spieler of Nvidia claimed LiDAR and supercomputers could seed a wave of infinitely complex digital twins. But Abhishek Singh, CEO of satellite imagery analysis company AIDash, and Sashin Mishra, AIDash\u2019s head of Europe and sustainability, disagree. They told us that much more comes from above than meets the eye, and that the complexity involved in monitoring utilities, landscapes or particular environments means that space might be the only environment for accurate asset monitoring. Various satellite companies offer imagery from different angles, at different times, across different wavelengths. Singh says: \u201cSo, the visual band is just one wavelength we have available. We also have multi-spectral bands, which has bands like near infrared, shortened wave infrared, radio waves \u2026 and each different bands give us different information, and they all have different capabilities. \u201cIf we wanted to monitor flooding, then we cannot use visual bands because they cannot see through clouds. We can use synthetic aperture radar imagery to penetrate through cloud and give complete flood mapping in almost real-time.\u201d This range of processes means space-based monitoring can be used for a range of functions, both within a particular industry, or with broader environmental applications such as monitoring biodiversity. \u201cIf I have to monitor temperatures, or if there\u2019s a wildfire, I can use infrared imagery to find if there are pockets or sections on land which are hotter than others,\u201d continues Singh. \u201cTo monitor forest health, I can use multi-spectral imagery which has visual signatures, but also has other bands which tell us about the tree health. It tells us about the dryness of the vegetation, showing dying trees, dead trees, healthy trees. From there, we can start to assess the health of an ecosystem, and its biodiversity.\u201d Most areas cannot be monitored frequently, regularly, quickly or in detail without significant cost. In many applications, LiDAR offers a comparable service. For systems monitoring, particularly on power lines, space-based imagery competes with ground-based LiDAR imagery. LiDAR uses laser emitters to build 3D models of their surroundings from relatively close range. This has created increasingly large digital twins of power supply lines, such as Fugro\u2019s digital twin of Tasmania\u2019s power distribution network. In the US, various power companies use LiDAR to map their power lines, and assess their vulnerability to storms. Naturally, Singh and Mishra have criticisms of the application of LiDAR. Singh says: \u201cLiDAR data collection is both slow and expensive. You have to fly your helicopter, or drive your vehicle along the power lines, so it takes months to collect data. Once that data is collected, analysing it takes weeks or months, so by the time the analysis is made, things have changed. \u201cNo utility in the world is using LiDAR frequently on their distribution lines. The use of LiDAR is primarily limited to transmission line monitoring. In the US, it monitors less than 10% of distribution lines.\u201d Mishra continues, pointing to the environmental damage associated with LiDAR monitoring: \u201cA helicopter typically flies at around 200kph. If it covers a line in one direction, it then has to fly back, halving its effective coverage over time. That doesn\u2019t count take-off and landing. That means that, for a line of about 150km or 200km, emissions would be about one ton of carbon dioxide. \u201cIf we break down a satellite\u2019s entire life cycle, including days of operation, images captured per day, then monitoring a 150km line would emit 69g per view. Ultimately, it\u2019s self-defeating from a sustainability point-of-view.\u201d While satellites are not without environmental impact, the satellites used for image gathering are much smaller than conventional satellites. These occupy otherwise unused spaces on other, larger satellite launches, in sizes down to that of a clenched fist. While these have much shorter operating lives than larger satellites, these microsatellites arguably have small launch emissions, and no operating emissions. Biodiversity describes the variety of plants and animals within an ecosystem. Each site has its own unique considerations, but biodiversity gives a broad-brush description of humanity\u2019s impact on an area. Many sectors \u2013 construction, mining, most heavy industries \u2013 can deal significant damage to an environment, and in this context, companies will look to maintain a region\u2019s biodiversity by ensuring the environment remains unchanged once its work is complete. The variety of animal life is hard to track via any distant method. However, all animals eventually rely on plants, which can be more easily assessed, and provide a snapshot of an industrial process\u2019s impacts on an area. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about utilities, but because of biodiversity monitoring, we\u2019re seeing interest from mining companies as well,\u201d says Mishra. \u201dWe\u2019re talking to a customer who would like us to look at the forest in Mozambique, which has regulations around biodiversity. Because they\u2019ve got these regulations, we can just map their definition [of biodiversity] back into our system\u201d Mishra adds: \u201cYou require some sort of a regulatory framework to be able to determine how to measure biodiversity, and that will be based on the country you operate in. Not all countries have regulations for this, but Europe is not the only area thinking about it. \u201cLocal flora and fauna change every few hundred kilometres. How, then, do you determine whether you bringing the right biodiversity? Can you just bring in any variety of tree or animal? The answer to that is no.

The Shelburne-based Hack Club from the US, a global network of high school computer hackers, makers and coders will organise the event, for the first time in India. Thirteen students, including five girls, studying from classes 8 to 10 of Sri Sarada Vidyanilayam (SSV), Nakkavanipalem, are from Visakhapatnam, while one student is from the ATL of Nagarjuna Model School in Kadapa. Speaking to The Hindu, the ATL\u2019s Visakhapatnam Regional Mentor V. Raja Sekhar said, \u201cThese students are an inspiration to other ATL students in the State.

The ATLs act as mentors to the students at the foundation-level, he added. From 2018, ATLs have been launched in the State in a phased manner. An average of around 200 students are mentored at each ATL. Of the 10,000 ATLs across the country, 20 are located in Visakhapatnam and 700 in Andhra Pradesh, he said while adding that the ATLs are part of Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) set up by NITI Aayog with an objective to create and encourage an environment of innovation and entrepreneurship among the school students. The SSV school\u2019s ATL in-charge P.D.L.N. Srinivasa Rao said, \u201cThis will be a great opportunity for all of us. The students got this opportunity because of their active performance in tinkering activities ranging from basic electronics, IoT, robotics, cultivation, astronomy to artistic skills like wool crafts.\u201d The SSV\u2019s Class X student N. Pavani, who is active in coding, said: \u201cSince my father is a mason, I closely observe his work, apart from learning other aspects from our teachers.

The space economy is rocketing into 2023 on a gravitational wave of big headlines. Billionaire man-children racing to be the first industrial tycoon of outer space have been responsible for an unproportionate chunk of those headlines. It\u2019s understandable that they have been the focal point of journalistic missives from around the world, but the founders of Amazon, Virgin and the Boring Company hardly represent the big picture of the space economy. Still, their endeavours catch people\u2019s imagination of a potential interstellar future \u2013 as well as providing setups for jokes and jibes. Jeff Bezos blasting himself into the lower reaches of the final frontier riding a penis-shaped rocket has been the comedic gift that keeps on giving.  Similarly, Richard Branson may be able to claim to have breached the lower barriers of space, but his decades-long struggle to transform Virgin Galactic into a profitable project are still long ways off, raising questions about the business plan behind the venture.  Elon Musk, the chided chief twit who\u2019s seen Tesla shares tank since his Twitter takeover, has not engaged in the same kind of space tourism endeavours as his billionaire kin \u2013 apart from selecting a passenger to join a Space X trip around the moon at some point in the future. However, he has arguably made an impact on a geopolitical scale by providing Ukraine with access to his Starlink satellite network to protect the nation\u2019s digital infrastructure and prevent internet outages amidst the Russian invasion.  Although, whatever goodwill he may have drummed up from Ukraine seemingly evaporated in October when he posted a Twitter poll suggesting that the country should just give up some occupied territories to Moscow in order to end the conflict. Ukraine\u2019s German ambassador Andry Melynk fired back with an angry tweet, not mincing his words. \u201cFuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,\u201d Melnyk tweeted, adding that the \u201conly outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f\u2026ing tesla crap. So good luck to you.\u201d Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk   While the noise from these billionaire projects is overpowering at times, they don\u2019t detract from the fact that the space economy is heading into 2023 on a promise of stratospheric potential.  Research and analyst firm GlobalData has forecast that the industry will be worth over $1tn by 2040. In a recent report, analysts from the firm noted that while defense deals, scientific progress and celebrity flights make up the bulk of headlines, other factors play an even bigger part in the industry\u2019s future.  These factors include technological advancements in space solar cells, network latency and reusable launches. These advancements are set to stimulate real growth in the space economy. In addition, the researchers estimated that the construction of space stations, space tourism and mining projects will make up a significant amount of commercial space activity by 2030.  In order to make heads and tails of the future of the space economy, we reached out to market stakeholders and experts to hear their predictions for what\u2019s to come in 2023. Check out what they had to say below. AI and machine learning to be applied more widely to analyse huge datasets generated in space. While AI and machine learning are already used in other sectors, practical applications in space are currently in their very early stages. In 2023, however, we will begin to see new capabilities applied more frequently when it comes to analysing huge datasets generated by satellites.  Currently, most sensors in space downlink everything they are trying to collect, which makes it difficult for those on the ground to pick out signals from the noise in a timely manner. Using AI and machine learning to analyse this data on board makes it possible to only downlink relevant pieces of information rather than sending the data set. The benefits will be significant for people on Earth, enabling us to better protect citizens in near real-time. The rapidly increasing number of satellites in orbit has been a theme in 2022 and this seems sure to continue in 2023. While the Starlink internet satellite constellation has the most satellites in orbit, other constellations are on the horizon including Kuiper and BlueBird.\u00a0 With this rapid growth, there is increasing concern about the environmental impact of satellite constellations, including light pollution of the night sky, and this has been highlighted by a recent report by the\u00a0US Government Accountability Office\u00a0and the launch of BlueWalker 3 (a prototype for BlueBird). There should be several new rockets launched into orbit for the first time in 2023. The first SpaceX Starship may launch in December 2022, but this could easily slip in 2023. Starship could be a game changer for launching very massive payloads into orbit \u2013 particularly if its costs are as low as predicted. The first Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6 launchers are also planned for 2023 (amongst others), so the range of launchers available will look quite different in late-2023 to what it did 5 or 10 years ago. There will be many crewed spaceflights during 2023, including Crew Dragon, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the first (much delayed) crewed Starliner flight. Looking beyond 2023, excitingly, crewed circumlunar spaceflights with the Starship and Orion spacecraft are possibilities for 2024. There\u2019s plenty to look forward to in the space industry in 2023. The next year will be categorised by space tourism, exploration missions, innovation in the next generation CubeSats and excitement for the next Moon and Mars missions. One of the highly anticipated missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) interplanetary mission scheduled to launch in April 2023. The spacecraft will carry out mission studies to the Jupiter\u2019s moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa and will reach Jupiter in July 2031 after around eight years of travel. It will perform multiple gravity assists manoeuvre.\u00a0 The spacecraft will eventually enter the orbit around Ganymede for its close-up mission, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than the moon of Earth. The JUICE mission will address two themes of ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme: What are the conditions for planet formation and emergence of life? and how does the Solar System work?\u00a0The total mission duration is close to 11 years, of which about 3.5 years would be spent in the Jupiter system. The second anticipated mission is the Psyche mission and is scheduled to launch in October 2023. This is the first mission to a unique metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, to study the origins of its formation. Currently the mission is in the instrument, spacecraft assembly and testing phase and will be launched by NASA. This mission will shed light on the formation of the rocky planet with iron core. It could help in understanding the formation of our planet with iron core in the centre.\u00a0 The successful launch of NASA Artemis 1 and all the future mission to Moon, Mars and beyond will propel more enthusiasm in the next generation of students to choose the STEM subjects. I am sure 2023 is going to be another exciting year for all the space enthusiasts and it will certainly ignite spark of curiosity in young space explorers to look beyond the horizon as sky is not the limit.  In 2023, space innovation will become even more vital for boosting defences and delivering advantages on Earth, especially in a time of increased conflict and tension. We\u2019ll therefore see more emphasis on growing the sector in line with the government\u2019s National Space and Defence Space Strategies. As part of this growth in innovation, a greater focus will be placed on involving smaller organisations in defence programmes and contracts. For this to happen, the relationship between \u2018primes\u2019 and SMEs will need to evolve beyond supply chains, which means working together in a new, dynamic way. Not only will this collaboration help smaller organisations in the space sector to grow, but it will also enable \u2018primes\u2019 to deliver enhanced capabilities to customers.\u00a0 The onus is also on customers to encourage collaboration by outlining it in contracts and development programmes. Risk levels increase when working with smaller organisations, which is something customers will have to accept and build into programmes. Within all sectors, there is no doubt that sustainability will be a key focus in 2023 and beyond. For organisations within the space sector, there are two very different areas they need to address.\u00a0 The first relates to the organisations themselves. Many will continue to find ways to develop capabilities in a sustainable way to meet the net-zero targets. This might include switching to clean energy sources and electric propulsion to working in partnership with other organisations to introduce new green initiatives. The second links to sustainability in space. There is currently a growing amount of junk and debris in space, which is leading to a sustainability dilemma. Over the coming years, we will see more efforts to build awareness around the impact of satellite launches and deploying new equipment, as well as removing dead satellites. We can also expect to see the sector innovate to increase the life expectancy and versatility of satellites.  At BAE Systems, for example, we\u2019ve partnered with in-space missions to invest in satellites that are reprogrammable. Moving away from deployment and launch for a single mission, providing reconfigurable, mission-specific satellites that can refuel and re-equip in the longer term will be critical. The first major satellite hack [is coming]. From the attacks on ViaSat via supply chain vulnerabilities which exposed the ground terminal, to more recent threats against Starlink low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, events in 2022 have indicated that the space race is far from over. In 2023, the focus will continue to shift towards satellite compromise, with the first major satellite hack to be expected in the next 12 months. This will likely involve all three main attack vectors: ground, communication links and payload hijacking.\u00a0 From the ground station perspective, it is highly possible that vulnerabilities in physical security will be targeted. Leveraging the cost-of-living crisis, malicious actors could exploit insiders to gain direct access to satellite operations centres and mission operations centres. This will enable them to take control of spacecraft, disable communication links or capture all earthbound transmissions. Communication links will also be a prime target in the coming years. Earth-to-LEO satellite communications are vulnerable as spacecraft are frequently passing over potentially hostile territory. The adversary can use satellite blinding as these satellites pass to capture critical imagery or radio frequency data.\u00a0 Lastly, poorly developed DevSecOps principles could see the introduction of malware based on the reliance on COTs code bases. A lack of understanding around code and applications could allow an attacker to hide on spacecraft payload and run tasks undetected. While the category may fall outside of what would traditionally be considered relevant to advances in the space industry, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) will play a pivotal role in the exploration of space communications in 2023.  The reason can be summarised in one word: data. While there are clearly many unique and interesting aspects about the space environment, the ability to securely and privately leverage the vast volume of space-related data across boundaries at scale is foundational to advancing our collective capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No matter where it takes place and the value it can provide, ubiquitous data usage is not without its challenges. Data is the backbone of the digital economy and organisations across all sectors are increasingly having to balance value extraction and risk management. The pace of change has left regulators and lawmakers scrambling to keep up, which frequently leads to a lack of clarity. PETs enable, enhance, and preserve the privacy of data throughout its lifecycle, allowing entities to achieve secure and private data usage without compromising data ownership or exposing sensitive indicators or insights. The PETs momentum began to build in the space arena this year as organisations worked together to design and build new space-based communications. In July 2022, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) announced the launch of its hybrid space architecture program (HSA), which aims to integrate commercial and government space assets to provide global, secure internet connectivity across multiple domains for commercial, civil, and military users, including international partners. This use case requires secure data sharing and collaboration, capabilities that can be uniquely provided by PETs. Leveraging the power of PETs, organisations can extract insights, cross-match, search, and analyse space-related data at scale in ways that are not otherwise possible. These capabilities are being woven into the fabric of projects like the HSA to help leverage both commercial and government space assets across diverse orbits to provide secure, assured, and low-latency data communications anywhere on and off Earth. In 2023, PETs will significantly help shape space as the mission landscape of the future where data interoperability, security, and access are critical to advancing any collaborative effort. I\u2019m really enthused by the advances we\u2019re likely to see in the space industry next year. No least the fact that 2023 will be marked by the first trials of \u2018direct to mobile\u2019 cellular connectivity from space, thanks to the growing constellation of low LEO satellites. The technology of these first-of-a-kind satellites features the huge phase-array antennas that will one day become the norm. No special user terminal is required, and they will work with a regular cell phone. AST Space Mobile are leading the way, but companies such as SpaceX have started their own design and development as competition hots up. Connectivity will start with text messaging services, but I predict this will be the catalyst for \u2018data everywhere\u2019 and a new gold rush for mobile network operators. Watch this space. Some other thoughts? Look out for innovations such as transparent phased array antennas, which will be a key and exciting area of research in 2023. Meanwhile, the coming 12 months will also see significant uptake for \u2018broadband from space\u2019 as the mega-constellations achieve operational status. The UK government has just announced a deal with Starlink to provide rural broadband coverage in certain parts of the country. The mega constellations target fixed wireless broadband and require dedicated terminal equipment. We\u2019re talking about a game-changer for some of the 3bn people in the world who have never used the internet. The technology is great for home and enterprise use, but there is increasing demand for \u2018comms on the move\u2019 and I anticipate further innovation that will enable high-speed data in current blackspots. I\u2019m thinking commercial aviation and maritime applications. As well as \u2018broadband from space\u2019 a quiet revolution has been happening in the \u2018remote IOT\u2019 world.  Satellites using narrowband technology enable COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) IoT devices to connect anywhere on the planet. 2023 will see initial trials and new commercial opportunities emerge as global low-cost, low-power data collection becomes a reality. And a final word \u2013 all of these new services require supporting infrastructure!.So, expect design and development of all of the following will advance in 2023: gas stations in space; assembly and maintenance vehicles in LEO; and network support infrastructure to include data trunking systems and backhaul plus data storage and processing.  Space solar power will be in increasingly discussed topic in as energy prices continue to rise and the need to address climate change intensifies. That means solar panels in space and energy transfer to earth using lasers or microwave beams. 2023? Bring it on. We saw a number of trends emerge in the spacetech sector in 2022, and we can only expect for them to continue throughout 2023. The burgeoning space industry will flourish as a result of the seeds sown in the previous year; an increasing budget, a global commitment to space exploration, and a growing awareness of the new space economy.\u00a0 It\u2019s not only private individuals and venture capital firms that invest in space \u2013 the industry has both national and supranational backing. Towards the end of 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced a 17% rise in its budget, and it will be interesting to see how the region\u2019s space programme takes shape as this capital is distributed among nations.  Looking closer to home, the UK laid the foundations for a bright future in space this year. it\u2019s quite unlikely that there will be a rocket launch from UK soil in 2023. While Following the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Spaceflight Team, the Department of Transport and UK Space Agency\u2019s decision to granted grant the UK\u2019s first spaceport licence to Spaceport Cornwall, we will inevitably see how the intricacies of vertical launch sites still need are to be ironed out due to the complexities of those launches.\u00a0 For Skyrora, in 2023 look forward to ensuring safe and responsible UK launch in the future through the granting of our launch vehicle licence application from the CAA, the application for which our talented team successfully completed and submitted earlier this year.we hope our launch operator licence application will be accepted.  This will of course bring us closer to our goal of orbital launch, and follows the momentum building milestones we achieved throughout 2022 to bring sovereign orbital launch capabilities to the UK. The technology is in place for the UK to have an agile and mobile launch infrastructure and market demand for a variety of in-orbit services is only going to grow stronger in the year ahead.

The space economy is rocketing into 2023 on a gravitational wave of big headlines. Billionaire man-children racing to be the first industrial tycoon of outer space have been responsible for an unproportionate chunk of those headlines. It\u2019s understandable that they have been the focal point of journalistic missives from around the world, but the founders of Amazon, Virgin and the Boring Company hardly represent the big picture of the space economy. Still, their endeavours catch people\u2019s imagination of a potential interstellar future \u2013 as well as providing setups for jokes and jibes. Jeff Bezos blasting himself into the lower reaches of the final frontier riding a penis-shaped rocket has been the comedic gift that keeps on giving.  Similarly, Richard Branson may be able to claim to have breached the lower barriers of space, but his decades-long struggle to transform Virgin Galactic into a profitable project are still long ways off, raising questions about the business plan behind the venture.  Elon Musk, the chided chief twit who\u2019s seen Tesla shares tank since his Twitter takeover, has not engaged in the same kind of space tourism endeavours as his billionaire kin \u2013 apart from selecting a passenger to join a Space X trip around the moon at some point in the future. However, he has arguably made an impact on a geopolitical scale by providing Ukraine with access to his Starlink satellite network to protect the nation\u2019s digital infrastructure and prevent internet outages amidst the Russian invasion.  Although, whatever goodwill he may have drummed up from Ukraine seemingly evaporated in October when he posted a Twitter poll suggesting that the country should just give up some occupied territories to Moscow in order to end the conflict. Ukraine\u2019s German ambassador Andry Melynk fired back with an angry tweet, not mincing his words. \u201cFuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,\u201d Melnyk tweeted, adding that the \u201conly outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f\u2026ing tesla crap. So good luck to you.\u201d Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk   While the noise from these billionaire projects is overpowering at times, they don\u2019t detract from the fact that the space economy is heading into 2023 on a promise of stratospheric potential.  Research and analyst firm GlobalData has forecast that the industry will be worth over $1tn by 2040. In a recent report, analysts from the firm noted that while defense deals, scientific progress and celebrity flights make up the bulk of headlines, other factors play an even bigger part in the industry\u2019s future.  These factors include technological advancements in space solar cells, network latency and reusable launches. These advancements are set to stimulate real growth in the space economy. In addition, the researchers estimated that the construction of space stations, space tourism and mining projects will make up a significant amount of commercial space activity by 2030.  In order to make heads and tails of the future of the space economy, we reached out to market stakeholders and experts to hear their predictions for what\u2019s to come in 2023. Check out what they had to say below. AI and machine learning to be applied more widely to analyse huge datasets generated in space. While AI and machine learning are already used in other sectors, practical applications in space are currently in their very early stages. In 2023, however, we will begin to see new capabilities applied more frequently when it comes to analysing huge datasets generated by satellites.  Currently, most sensors in space downlink everything they are trying to collect, which makes it difficult for those on the ground to pick out signals from the noise in a timely manner. Using AI and machine learning to analyse this data on board makes it possible to only downlink relevant pieces of information rather than sending the data set. The benefits will be significant for people on Earth, enabling us to better protect citizens in near real-time. The rapidly increasing number of satellites in orbit has been a theme in 2022 and this seems sure to continue in 2023. While the Starlink internet satellite constellation has the most satellites in orbit, other constellations are on the horizon including Kuiper and BlueBird.\u00a0 With this rapid growth, there is increasing concern about the environmental impact of satellite constellations, including light pollution of the night sky, and this has been highlighted by a recent report by the\u00a0US Government Accountability Office\u00a0and the launch of BlueWalker 3 (a prototype for BlueBird). There should be several new rockets launched into orbit for the first time in 2023. The first SpaceX Starship may launch in December 2022, but this could easily slip in 2023. Starship could be a game changer for launching very massive payloads into orbit \u2013 particularly if its costs are as low as predicted. The first Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6 launchers are also planned for 2023 (amongst others), so the range of launchers available will look quite different in late-2023 to what it did 5 or 10 years ago. There will be many crewed spaceflights during 2023, including Crew Dragon, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the first (much delayed) crewed Starliner flight. Looking beyond 2023, excitingly, crewed circumlunar spaceflights with the Starship and Orion spacecraft are possibilities for 2024. There\u2019s plenty to look forward to in the space industry in 2023. The next year will be categorised by space tourism, exploration missions, innovation in the next generation CubeSats and excitement for the next Moon and Mars missions. One of the highly anticipated missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) interplanetary mission scheduled to launch in April 2023. The spacecraft will carry out mission studies to the Jupiter\u2019s moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa and will reach Jupiter in July 2031 after around eight years of travel. It will perform multiple gravity assists manoeuvre.\u00a0 The spacecraft will eventually enter the orbit around Ganymede for its close-up mission, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than the moon of Earth. The JUICE mission will address two themes of ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme: What are the conditions for planet formation and emergence of life? and how does the Solar System work?\u00a0The total mission duration is close to 11 years, of which about 3.5 years would be spent in the Jupiter system. The second anticipated mission is the Psyche mission and is scheduled to launch in October 2023. This is the first mission to a unique metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, to study the origins of its formation. Currently the mission is in the instrument, spacecraft assembly and testing phase and will be launched by NASA. This mission will shed light on the formation of the rocky planet with iron core. It could help in understanding the formation of our planet with iron core in the centre.\u00a0 The successful launch of NASA Artemis 1 and all the future mission to Moon, Mars and beyond will propel more enthusiasm in the next generation of students to choose the STEM subjects. I am sure 2023 is going to be another exciting year for all the space enthusiasts and it will certainly ignite spark of curiosity in young space explorers to look beyond the horizon as sky is not the limit.  In 2023, space innovation will become even more vital for boosting defences and delivering advantages on Earth, especially in a time of increased conflict and tension. We\u2019ll therefore see more emphasis on growing the sector in line with the government\u2019s National Space and Defence Space Strategies. As part of this growth in innovation, a greater focus will be placed on involving smaller organisations in defence programmes and contracts. For this to happen, the relationship between \u2018primes\u2019 and SMEs will need to evolve beyond supply chains, which means working together in a new, dynamic way. Not only will this collaboration help smaller organisations in the space sector to grow, but it will also enable \u2018primes\u2019 to deliver enhanced capabilities to customers.\u00a0 The onus is also on customers to encourage collaboration by outlining it in contracts and development programmes. Risk levels increase when working with smaller organisations, which is something customers will have to accept and build into programmes. Within all sectors, there is no doubt that sustainability will be a key focus in 2023 and beyond. For organisations within the space sector, there are two very different areas they need to address.\u00a0 The first relates to the organisations themselves. Many will continue to find ways to develop capabilities in a sustainable way to meet the net-zero targets. This might include switching to clean energy sources and electric propulsion to working in partnership with other organisations to introduce new green initiatives. The second links to sustainability in space. There is currently a growing amount of junk and debris in space, which is leading to a sustainability dilemma. Over the coming years, we will see more efforts to build awareness around the impact of satellite launches and deploying new equipment, as well as removing dead satellites. We can also expect to see the sector innovate to increase the life expectancy and versatility of satellites.  At BAE Systems, for example, we\u2019ve partnered with in-space missions to invest in satellites that are reprogrammable. Moving away from deployment and launch for a single mission, providing reconfigurable, mission-specific satellites that can refuel and re-equip in the longer term will be critical. The first major satellite hack [is coming]. From the attacks on ViaSat via supply chain vulnerabilities which exposed the ground terminal, to more recent threats against Starlink low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, events in 2022 have indicated that the space race is far from over. In 2023, the focus will continue to shift towards satellite compromise, with the first major satellite hack to be expected in the next 12 months. This will likely involve all three main attack vectors: ground, communication links and payload hijacking.\u00a0 From the ground station perspective, it is highly possible that vulnerabilities in physical security will be targeted. Leveraging the cost-of-living crisis, malicious actors could exploit insiders to gain direct access to satellite operations centres and mission operations centres. This will enable them to take control of spacecraft, disable communication links or capture all earthbound transmissions. Communication links will also be a prime target in the coming years. Earth-to-LEO satellite communications are vulnerable as spacecraft are frequently passing over potentially hostile territory. The adversary can use satellite blinding as these satellites pass to capture critical imagery or radio frequency data.\u00a0 Lastly, poorly developed DevSecOps principles could see the introduction of malware based on the reliance on COTs code bases. A lack of understanding around code and applications could allow an attacker to hide on spacecraft payload and run tasks undetected. While the category may fall outside of what would traditionally be considered relevant to advances in the space industry, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) will play a pivotal role in the exploration of space communications in 2023.  The reason can be summarised in one word: data. While there are clearly many unique and interesting aspects about the space environment, the ability to securely and privately leverage the vast volume of space-related data across boundaries at scale is foundational to advancing our collective capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No matter where it takes place and the value it can provide, ubiquitous data usage is not without its challenges. Data is the backbone of the digital economy and organisations across all sectors are increasingly having to balance value extraction and risk management. The pace of change has left regulators and lawmakers scrambling to keep up, which frequently leads to a lack of clarity. PETs enable, enhance, and preserve the privacy of data throughout its lifecycle, allowing entities to achieve secure and private data usage without compromising data ownership or exposing sensitive indicators or insights. The PETs momentum began to build in the space arena this year as organisations worked together to design and build new space-based communications. In July 2022, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) announced the launch of its hybrid space architecture program (HSA), which aims to integrate commercial and government space assets to provide global, secure internet connectivity across multiple domains for commercial, civil, and military users, including international partners. This use case requires secure data sharing and collaboration, capabilities that can be uniquely provided by PETs. Leveraging the power of PETs, organisations can extract insights, cross-match, search, and analyse space-related data at scale in ways that are not otherwise possible. These capabilities are being woven into the fabric of projects like the HSA to help leverage both commercial and government space assets across diverse orbits to provide secure, assured, and low-latency data communications anywhere on and off Earth. In 2023, PETs will significantly help shape space as the mission landscape of the future where data interoperability, security, and access are critical to advancing any collaborative effort. I\u2019m really enthused by the advances we\u2019re likely to see in the space industry next year. No least the fact that 2023 will be marked by the first trials of \u2018direct to mobile\u2019 cellular connectivity from space, thanks to the growing constellation of low LEO satellites. The technology of these first-of-a-kind satellites features the huge phase-array antennas that will one day become the norm. No special user terminal is required, and they will work with a regular cell phone. AST Space Mobile are leading the way, but companies such as SpaceX have started their own design and development as competition hots up. Connectivity will start with text messaging services, but I predict this will be the catalyst for \u2018data everywhere\u2019 and a new gold rush for mobile network operators. Watch this space. Some other thoughts? Look out for innovations such as transparent phased array antennas, which will be a key and exciting area of research in 2023. Meanwhile, the coming 12 months will also see significant uptake for \u2018broadband from space\u2019 as the mega-constellations achieve operational status. The UK government has just announced a deal with Starlink to provide rural broadband coverage in certain parts of the country. The mega constellations target fixed wireless broadband and require dedicated terminal equipment. We\u2019re talking about a game-changer for some of the 3bn people in the world who have never used the internet. The technology is great for home and enterprise use, but there is increasing demand for \u2018comms on the move\u2019 and I anticipate further innovation that will enable high-speed data in current blackspots. I\u2019m thinking commercial aviation and maritime applications. As well as \u2018broadband from space\u2019 a quiet revolution has been happening in the \u2018remote IOT\u2019 world.

Connectivity will start with text messaging services, but I predict this will be the catalyst for \u2018data everywhere\u2019 and a new gold rush for mobile network operators. Watch this space. Some other thoughts? Look out for innovations such as transparent phased array antennas, which will be a key and exciting area of research in 2023. Meanwhile, the coming 12 months will also see significant uptake for \u2018broadband from space\u2019 as the mega-constellations achieve operational status. The UK government has just announced a deal with Starlink to provide rural broadband coverage in certain parts of the country. The mega constellations target fixed wireless broadband and require dedicated terminal equipment. We\u2019re talking about a game-changer for some of the 3bn people in the world who have never used the internet. The technology is great for home and enterprise use, but there is increasing demand for \u2018comms on the move\u2019 and I anticipate further innovation that will enable high-speed data in current blackspots. I\u2019m thinking commercial aviation and maritime applications. As well as \u2018broadband from space\u2019 a quiet revolution has been happening in the \u2018remote IOT\u2019 world.  Satellites using narrowband technology enable COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) IoT devices to connect anywhere on the planet. 2023 will see initial trials and new commercial opportunities emerge as global low-cost, low-power data collection becomes a reality. And a final word \u2013 all of these new services require supporting infrastructure!.So, expect design and development of all of the following will advance in 2023: gas stations in space; assembly and maintenance vehicles in LEO; and network support infrastructure to include data trunking systems and backhaul plus data storage and processing.  Space solar power will be in increasingly discussed topic in as energy prices continue to rise and the need to address climate change intensifies. That means solar panels in space and energy transfer to earth using lasers or microwave beams. 2023? Bring it on. We saw a number of trends emerge in the spacetech sector in 2022, and we can only expect for them to continue throughout 2023. The burgeoning space industry will flourish as a result of the seeds sown in the previous year; an increasing budget, a global commitment to space exploration, and a growing awareness of the new space economy.\u00a0 It\u2019s not only private individuals and venture capital firms that invest in space \u2013 the industry has both national and supranational backing. Towards the end of 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced a 17% rise in its budget, and it will be interesting to see how the region\u2019s space programme takes shape as this capital is distributed among nations.  Looking closer to home, the UK laid the foundations for a bright future in space this year. it\u2019s quite unlikely that there will be a rocket launch from UK soil in 2023. While Following the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Spaceflight Team, the Department of Transport and UK Space Agency\u2019s decision to granted grant the UK\u2019s first spaceport licence to Spaceport Cornwall, we will inevitably see how the intricacies of vertical launch sites still need are to be ironed out due to the complexities of those launches.\u00a0 For Skyrora, in 2023 look forward to ensuring safe and responsible UK launch in the future through the granting of our launch vehicle licence application from the CAA, the application for which our talented team successfully completed and submitted earlier this year.we hope our launch operator licence application will be accepted.  This will of course bring us closer to our goal of orbital launch, and follows the momentum building milestones we achieved throughout 2022 to bring sovereign orbital launch capabilities to the UK. The technology is in place for the UK to have an agile and mobile launch infrastructure and market demand for a variety of in-orbit services is only going to grow stronger in the year ahead.

The space economy is rocketing into 2023 on a gravitational wave of big headlines. Billionaire man-children racing to be the first industrial tycoon of outer space have been responsible for an unproportionate chunk of those headlines. It\u2019s understandable that they have been the focal point of journalistic missives from around the world, but the founders of Amazon, Virgin and the Boring Company hardly represent the big picture of the space economy. Still, their endeavours catch people\u2019s imagination of a potential interstellar future \u2013 as well as providing setups for jokes and jibes. Jeff Bezos blasting himself into the lower reaches of the final frontier riding a penis-shaped rocket has been the comedic gift that keeps on giving.  Similarly, Richard Branson may be able to claim to have breached the lower barriers of space, but his decades-long struggle to transform Virgin Galactic into a profitable project are still long ways off, raising questions about the business plan behind the venture.  Elon Musk, the chided chief twit who\u2019s seen Tesla shares tank since his Twitter takeover, has not engaged in the same kind of space tourism endeavours as his billionaire kin \u2013 apart from selecting a passenger to join a Space X trip around the moon at some point in the future. However, he has arguably made an impact on a geopolitical scale by providing Ukraine with access to his Starlink satellite network to protect the nation\u2019s digital infrastructure and prevent internet outages amidst the Russian invasion.  Although, whatever goodwill he may have drummed up from Ukraine seemingly evaporated in October when he posted a Twitter poll suggesting that the country should just give up some occupied territories to Moscow in order to end the conflict. Ukraine\u2019s German ambassador Andry Melynk fired back with an angry tweet, not mincing his words. \u201cFuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,\u201d Melnyk tweeted, adding that the \u201conly outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f\u2026ing tesla crap. So good luck to you.\u201d Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk   While the noise from these billionaire projects is overpowering at times, they don\u2019t detract from the fact that the space economy is heading into 2023 on a promise of stratospheric potential.  Research and analyst firm GlobalData has forecast that the industry will be worth over $1tn by 2040. In a recent report, analysts from the firm noted that while defense deals, scientific progress and celebrity flights make up the bulk of headlines, other factors play an even bigger part in the industry\u2019s future.  These factors include technological advancements in space solar cells, network latency and reusable launches. These advancements are set to stimulate real growth in the space economy. In addition, the researchers estimated that the construction of space stations, space tourism and mining projects will make up a significant amount of commercial space activity by 2030.  In order to make heads and tails of the future of the space economy, we reached out to market stakeholders and experts to hear their predictions for what\u2019s to come in 2023. Check out what they had to say below. AI and machine learning to be applied more widely to analyse huge datasets generated in space. While AI and machine learning are already used in other sectors, practical applications in space are currently in their very early stages. In 2023, however, we will begin to see new capabilities applied more frequently when it comes to analysing huge datasets generated by satellites.  Currently, most sensors in space downlink everything they are trying to collect, which makes it difficult for those on the ground to pick out signals from the noise in a timely manner. Using AI and machine learning to analyse this data on board makes it possible to only downlink relevant pieces of information rather than sending the data set. The benefits will be significant for people on Earth, enabling us to better protect citizens in near real-time. The rapidly increasing number of satellites in orbit has been a theme in 2022 and this seems sure to continue in 2023. While the Starlink internet satellite constellation has the most satellites in orbit, other constellations are on the horizon including Kuiper and BlueBird.\u00a0 With this rapid growth, there is increasing concern about the environmental impact of satellite constellations, including light pollution of the night sky, and this has been highlighted by a recent report by the\u00a0US Government Accountability Office\u00a0and the launch of BlueWalker 3 (a prototype for BlueBird). There should be several new rockets launched into orbit for the first time in 2023. The first SpaceX Starship may launch in December 2022, but this could easily slip in 2023. Starship could be a game changer for launching very massive payloads into orbit \u2013 particularly if its costs are as low as predicted. The first Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6 launchers are also planned for 2023 (amongst others), so the range of launchers available will look quite different in late-2023 to what it did 5 or 10 years ago. There will be many crewed spaceflights during 2023, including Crew Dragon, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the first (much delayed) crewed Starliner flight. Looking beyond 2023, excitingly, crewed circumlunar spaceflights with the Starship and Orion spacecraft are possibilities for 2024. There\u2019s plenty to look forward to in the space industry in 2023. The next year will be categorised by space tourism, exploration missions, innovation in the next generation CubeSats and excitement for the next Moon and Mars missions. One of the highly anticipated missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) interplanetary mission scheduled to launch in April 2023. The spacecraft will carry out mission studies to the Jupiter\u2019s moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa and will reach Jupiter in July 2031 after around eight years of travel. It will perform multiple gravity assists manoeuvre.\u00a0 The spacecraft will eventually enter the orbit around Ganymede for its close-up mission, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than the moon of Earth. The JUICE mission will address two themes of ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme: What are the conditions for planet formation and emergence of life? and how does the Solar System work?\u00a0The total mission duration is close to 11 years, of which about 3.5 years would be spent in the Jupiter system. The second anticipated mission is the Psyche mission and is scheduled to launch in October 2023. This is the first mission to a unique metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, to study the origins of its formation. Currently the mission is in the instrument, spacecraft assembly and testing phase and will be launched by NASA. This mission will shed light on the formation of the rocky planet with iron core. It could help in understanding the formation of our planet with iron core in the centre.\u00a0 The successful launch of NASA Artemis 1 and all the future mission to Moon, Mars and beyond will propel more enthusiasm in the next generation of students to choose the STEM subjects. I am sure 2023 is going to be another exciting year for all the space enthusiasts and it will certainly ignite spark of curiosity in young space explorers to look beyond the horizon as sky is not the limit.  In 2023, space innovation will become even more vital for boosting defences and delivering advantages on Earth, especially in a time of increased conflict and tension. We\u2019ll therefore see more emphasis on growing the sector in line with the government\u2019s National Space and Defence Space Strategies. As part of this growth in innovation, a greater focus will be placed on involving smaller organisations in defence programmes and contracts. For this to happen, the relationship between \u2018primes\u2019 and SMEs will need to evolve beyond supply chains, which means working together in a new, dynamic way. Not only will this collaboration help smaller organisations in the space sector to grow, but it will also enable \u2018primes\u2019 to deliver enhanced capabilities to customers.\u00a0 The onus is also on customers to encourage collaboration by outlining it in contracts and development programmes. Risk levels increase when working with smaller organisations, which is something customers will have to accept and build into programmes. Within all sectors, there is no doubt that sustainability will be a key focus in 2023 and beyond. For organisations within the space sector, there are two very different areas they need to address.\u00a0 The first relates to the organisations themselves. Many will continue to find ways to develop capabilities in a sustainable way to meet the net-zero targets. This might include switching to clean energy sources and electric propulsion to working in partnership with other organisations to introduce new green initiatives. The second links to sustainability in space. There is currently a growing amount of junk and debris in space, which is leading to a sustainability dilemma. Over the coming years, we will see more efforts to build awareness around the impact of satellite launches and deploying new equipment, as well as removing dead satellites. We can also expect to see the sector innovate to increase the life expectancy and versatility of satellites.  At BAE Systems, for example, we\u2019ve partnered with in-space missions to invest in satellites that are reprogrammable. Moving away from deployment and launch for a single mission, providing reconfigurable, mission-specific satellites that can refuel and re-equip in the longer term will be critical. The first major satellite hack [is coming]. From the attacks on ViaSat via supply chain vulnerabilities which exposed the ground terminal, to more recent threats against Starlink low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, events in 2022 have indicated that the space race is far from over. In 2023, the focus will continue to shift towards satellite compromise, with the first major satellite hack to be expected in the next 12 months. This will likely involve all three main attack vectors: ground, communication links and payload hijacking.\u00a0 From the ground station perspective, it is highly possible that vulnerabilities in physical security will be targeted. Leveraging the cost-of-living crisis, malicious actors could exploit insiders to gain direct access to satellite operations centres and mission operations centres. This will enable them to take control of spacecraft, disable communication links or capture all earthbound transmissions. Communication links will also be a prime target in the coming years. Earth-to-LEO satellite communications are vulnerable as spacecraft are frequently passing over potentially hostile territory. The adversary can use satellite blinding as these satellites pass to capture critical imagery or radio frequency data.\u00a0 Lastly, poorly developed DevSecOps principles could see the introduction of malware based on the reliance on COTs code bases. A lack of understanding around code and applications could allow an attacker to hide on spacecraft payload and run tasks undetected. While the category may fall outside of what would traditionally be considered relevant to advances in the space industry, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) will play a pivotal role in the exploration of space communications in 2023.  The reason can be summarised in one word: data. While there are clearly many unique and interesting aspects about the space environment, the ability to securely and privately leverage the vast volume of space-related data across boundaries at scale is foundational to advancing our collective capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No matter where it takes place and the value it can provide, ubiquitous data usage is not without its challenges. Data is the backbone of the digital economy and organisations across all sectors are increasingly having to balance value extraction and risk management. The pace of change has left regulators and lawmakers scrambling to keep up, which frequently leads to a lack of clarity. PETs enable, enhance, and preserve the privacy of data throughout its lifecycle, allowing entities to achieve secure and private data usage without compromising data ownership or exposing sensitive indicators or insights. The PETs momentum began to build in the space arena this year as organisations worked together to design and build new space-based communications. In July 2022, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) announced the launch of its hybrid space architecture program (HSA), which aims to integrate commercial and government space assets to provide global, secure internet connectivity across multiple domains for commercial, civil, and military users, including international partners. This use case requires secure data sharing and collaboration, capabilities that can be uniquely provided by PETs. Leveraging the power of PETs, organisations can extract insights, cross-match, search, and analyse space-related data at scale in ways that are not otherwise possible. These capabilities are being woven into the fabric of projects like the HSA to help leverage both commercial and government space assets across diverse orbits to provide secure, assured, and low-latency data communications anywhere on and off Earth. In 2023, PETs will significantly help shape space as the mission landscape of the future where data interoperability, security, and access are critical to advancing any collaborative effort. I\u2019m really enthused by the advances we\u2019re likely to see in the space industry next year. No least the fact that 2023 will be marked by the first trials of \u2018direct to mobile\u2019 cellular connectivity from space, thanks to the growing constellation of low LEO satellites. The technology of these first-of-a-kind satellites features the huge phase-array antennas that will one day become the norm. No special user terminal is required, and they will work with a regular cell phone. AST Space Mobile are leading the way, but companies such as SpaceX have started their own design and development as competition hots up. Connectivity will start with text messaging services, but I predict this will be the catalyst for \u2018data everywhere\u2019 and a new gold rush for mobile network operators. Watch this space.

I\u2019m really enthused by the advances we\u2019re likely to see in the space industry next year. No least the fact that 2023 will be marked by the first trials of \u2018direct to mobile\u2019 cellular connectivity from space, thanks to the growing constellation of low LEO satellites. The technology of these first-of-a-kind satellites features the huge phase-array antennas that will one day become the norm. No special user terminal is required, and they will work with a regular cell phone. AST Space Mobile are leading the way, but companies such as SpaceX have started their own design and development as competition hots up. Connectivity will start with text messaging services, but I predict this will be the catalyst for \u2018data everywhere\u2019 and a new gold rush for mobile network operators. Watch this space. Some other thoughts? Look out for innovations such as transparent phased array antennas, which will be a key and exciting area of research in 2023. Meanwhile, the coming 12 months will also see significant uptake for \u2018broadband from space\u2019 as the mega-constellations achieve operational status. The UK government has just announced a deal with Starlink to provide rural broadband coverage in certain parts of the country. The mega constellations target fixed wireless broadband and require dedicated terminal equipment. We\u2019re talking about a game-changer for some of the 3bn people in the world who have never used the internet. The technology is great for home and enterprise use, but there is increasing demand for \u2018comms on the move\u2019 and I anticipate further innovation that will enable high-speed data in current blackspots. I\u2019m thinking commercial aviation and maritime applications. As well as \u2018broadband from space\u2019 a quiet revolution has been happening in the \u2018remote IOT\u2019 world.  Satellites using narrowband technology enable COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) IoT devices to connect anywhere on the planet. 2023 will see initial trials and new commercial opportunities emerge as global low-cost, low-power data collection becomes a reality. And a final word \u2013 all of these new services require supporting infrastructure!.So, expect design and development of all of the following will advance in 2023: gas stations in space; assembly and maintenance vehicles in LEO; and network support infrastructure to include data trunking systems and backhaul plus data storage and processing.  Space solar power will be in increasingly discussed topic in as energy prices continue to rise and the need to address climate change intensifies. That means solar panels in space and energy transfer to earth using lasers or microwave beams. 2023? Bring it on. We saw a number of trends emerge in the spacetech sector in 2022, and we can only expect for them to continue throughout 2023. The burgeoning space industry will flourish as a result of the seeds sown in the previous year; an increasing budget, a global commitment to space exploration, and a growing awareness of the new space economy.  It\u2019s not only private individuals and venture capital firms that invest in space \u2013 the industry has both national and supranational backing. Towards the end of 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced a 17% rise in its budget, and it will be interesting to see how the region\u2019s space programme takes shape as this capital is distributed among nations.  Looking closer to home, the UK laid the foundations for a bright future in space this year. it\u2019s quite unlikely that there will be a rocket launch from UK soil in 2023. While Following the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Spaceflight Team, the Department of Transport and UK Space Agency\u2019s decision to granted grant the UK\u2019s first spaceport licence to Spaceport Cornwall, we will inevitably see how the intricacies of vertical launch sites still need are to be ironed out due to the complexities of those launches.  For Skyrora, in 2023 look forward to ensuring safe and responsible UK launch in the future through the granting of our launch vehicle licence application from the CAA, the application for which our talented team successfully completed and submitted earlier this year.we hope our launch operator licence application will be accepted.  This will of course bring us closer to our goal of orbital launch, and follows the momentum building milestones we achieved throughout 2022 to bring sovereign orbital launch capabilities to the UK. The technology is in place for the UK to have an agile and mobile launch infrastructure and market demand for a variety of in-orbit services is only going to grow stronger in the year ahead.

However, he has arguably made an impact on a geopolitical scale by providing Ukraine with access to his Starlink satellite network to protect the nation\u2019s digital infrastructure and prevent internet outages amidst the Russian invasion.

Research and analyst firm GlobalData has forecast that the industry will be worth over $1tn by 2040. In a recent report, analysts from the firm noted that while defense deals, scientific progress and celebrity flights make up the bulk of headlines, other factors play an even bigger part in the industry\u2019s future.  These factors include technological advancements in space solar cells, network latency and reusable launches. These advancements are set to stimulate real growth in the space economy. In addition, the researchers estimated that the construction of space stations, space tourism and mining projects will make up a significant amount of commercial space activity by 2030.  In order to make heads and tails of the future of the space economy, we reached out to market stakeholders and experts to hear their predictions for what\u2019s to come in 2023. Check out what they had to say below. AI and machine learning to be applied more widely to analyse huge datasets generated in space. While AI and machine learning are already used in other sectors, practical applications in space are currently in their very early stages. In 2023, however, we will begin to see new capabilities applied more frequently when it comes to analysing huge datasets generated by satellites.  Currently, most sensors in space downlink everything they are trying to collect, which makes it difficult for those on the ground to pick out signals from the noise in a timely manner. Using AI and machine learning to analyse this data on board makes it possible to only downlink relevant pieces of information rather than sending the data set. The benefits will be significant for people on Earth, enabling us to better protect citizens in near real-time. The rapidly increasing number of satellites in orbit has been a theme in 2022 and this seems sure to continue in 2023. While the Starlink internet satellite constellation has the most satellites in orbit, other constellations are on the horizon including Kuiper and BlueBird.  With this rapid growth, there is increasing concern about the environmental impact of satellite constellations, including light pollution of the night sky, and this has been highlighted by a recent report by the US Government Accountability Office and the launch of BlueWalker 3 (a prototype for BlueBird). There should be several new rockets launched into orbit for the first time in 2023. The first SpaceX Starship may launch in December 2022, but this could easily slip in 2023. Starship could be a game changer for launching very massive payloads into orbit \u2013 particularly if its costs are as low as predicted. The first Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6 launchers are also planned for 2023 (amongst others), so the range of launchers available will look quite different in late-2023 to what it did 5 or 10 years ago. There will be many crewed spaceflights during 2023, including Crew Dragon, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the first (much delayed) crewed Starliner flight. Looking beyond 2023, excitingly, crewed circumlunar spaceflights with the Starship and Orion spacecraft are possibilities for 2024. There\u2019s plenty to look forward to in the space industry in 2023. The next year will be categorised by space tourism, exploration missions, innovation in the next generation CubeSats and excitement for the next Moon and Mars missions. One of the highly anticipated missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) interplanetary mission scheduled to launch in April 2023. The spacecraft will carry out mission studies to the Jupiter\u2019s moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa and will reach Jupiter in July 2031 after around eight years of travel. It will perform multiple gravity assists manoeuvre.  The spacecraft will eventually enter the orbit around Ganymede for its close-up mission, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than the moon of Earth. The JUICE mission will address two themes of ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme: What are the conditions for planet formation and emergence of life? and how does the Solar System work? The total mission duration is close to 11 years, of which about 3.5 years would be spent in the Jupiter system. The second anticipated mission is the Psyche mission and is scheduled to launch in October 2023. This is the first mission to a unique metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, to study the origins of its formation. Currently the mission is in the instrument, spacecraft assembly and testing phase and will be launched by NASA. This mission will shed light on the formation of the rocky planet with iron core. It could help in understanding the formation of our planet with iron core in the centre.  The successful launch of NASA Artemis 1 and all the future mission to Moon, Mars and beyond will propel more enthusiasm in the next generation of students to choose the STEM subjects. I am sure 2023 is going to be another exciting year for all the space enthusiasts and it will certainly ignite spark of curiosity in young space explorers to look beyond the horizon as sky is not the limit.  In 2023, space innovation will become even more vital for boosting defences and delivering advantages on Earth, especially in a time of increased conflict and tension. We\u2019ll therefore see more emphasis on growing the sector in line with the government\u2019s National Space and Defence Space Strategies. As part of this growth in innovation, a greater focus will be placed on involving smaller organisations in defence programmes and contracts. For this to happen, the relationship between \u2018primes\u2019 and SMEs will need to evolve beyond supply chains, which means working together in a new, dynamic way. Not only will this collaboration help smaller organisations in the space sector to grow, but it will also enable \u2018primes\u2019 to deliver enhanced capabilities to customers.  The onus is also on customers to encourage collaboration by outlining it in contracts and development programmes. Risk levels increase when working with smaller organisations, which is something customers will have to accept and build into programmes. Within all sectors, there is no doubt that sustainability will be a key focus in 2023 and beyond. For organisations within the space sector, there are two very different areas they need to address.  The first relates to the organisations themselves. Many will continue to find ways to develop capabilities in a sustainable way to meet the net-zero targets. This might include switching to clean energy sources and electric propulsion to working in partnership with other organisations to introduce new green initiatives. The second links to sustainability in space. There is currently a growing amount of junk and debris in space, which is leading to a sustainability dilemma. Over the coming years, we will see more efforts to build awareness around the impact of satellite launches and deploying new equipment, as well as removing dead satellites. We can also expect to see the sector innovate to increase the life expectancy and versatility of satellites.  At BAE Systems, for example, we\u2019ve partnered with in-space missions to invest in satellites that are reprogrammable. Moving away from deployment and launch for a single mission, providing reconfigurable, mission-specific satellites that can refuel and re-equip in the longer term will be critical. The first major satellite hack [is coming]. From the attacks on ViaSat via supply chain vulnerabilities which exposed the ground terminal, to more recent threats against Starlink low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, events in 2022 have indicated that the space race is far from over. In 2023, the focus will continue to shift towards satellite compromise, with the first major satellite hack to be expected in the next 12 months. This will likely involve all three main attack vectors: ground, communication links and payload hijacking.  From the ground station perspective, it is highly possible that vulnerabilities in physical security will be targeted. Leveraging the cost-of-living crisis, malicious actors could exploit insiders to gain direct access to satellite operations centres and mission operations centres. This will enable them to take control of spacecraft, disable communication links or capture all earthbound transmissions. Communication links will also be a prime target in the coming years. Earth-to-LEO satellite communications are vulnerable as spacecraft are frequently passing over potentially hostile territory. The adversary can use satellite blinding as these satellites pass to capture critical imagery or radio frequency data.  Lastly, poorly developed DevSecOps principles could see the introduction of malware based on the reliance on COTs code bases. A lack of understanding around code and applications could allow an attacker to hide on spacecraft payload and run tasks undetected. While the category may fall outside of what would traditionally be considered relevant to advances in the space industry, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) will play a pivotal role in the exploration of space communications in 2023.  The reason can be summarised in one word: data. While there are clearly many unique and interesting aspects about the space environment, the ability to securely and privately leverage the vast volume of space-related data across boundaries at scale is foundational to advancing our collective capabilities.    No matter where it takes place and the value it can provide, ubiquitous data usage is not without its challenges. Data is the backbone of the digital economy and organisations across all sectors are increasingly having to balance value extraction and risk management. The pace of change has left regulators and lawmakers scrambling to keep up, which frequently leads to a lack of clarity. PETs enable, enhance, and preserve the privacy of data throughout its lifecycle, allowing entities to achieve secure and private data usage without compromising data ownership or exposing sensitive indicators or insights. The PETs momentum began to build in the space arena this year as organisations worked together to design and build new space-based communications. In July 2022, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) announced the launch of its hybrid space architecture program (HSA), which aims to integrate commercial and government space assets to provide global, secure internet connectivity across multiple domains for commercial, civil, and military users, including international partners. This use case requires secure data sharing and collaboration, capabilities that can be uniquely provided by PETs. Leveraging the power of PETs, organisations can extract insights, cross-match, search, and analyse space-related data at scale in ways that are not otherwise possible. These capabilities are being woven into the fabric of projects like the HSA to help leverage both commercial and government space assets across diverse orbits to provide secure, assured, and low-latency data communications anywhere on and off Earth. In 2023, PETs will significantly help shape space as the mission landscape of the future where data interoperability, security, and access are critical to advancing any collaborative effort.

While the category may fall outside of what would traditionally be considered relevant to advances in the space industry, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) will play a pivotal role in the exploration of space communications in 2023.  The reason can be summarised in one word: data. While there are clearly many unique and interesting aspects about the space environment, the ability to securely and privately leverage the vast volume of space-related data across boundaries at scale is foundational to advancing our collective capabilities.    No matter where it takes place and the value it can provide, ubiquitous data usage is not without its challenges. Data is the backbone of the digital economy and organisations across all sectors are increasingly having to balance value extraction and risk management. The pace of change has left regulators and lawmakers scrambling to keep up, which frequently leads to a lack of clarity. PETs enable, enhance, and preserve the privacy of data throughout its lifecycle, allowing entities to achieve secure and private data usage without compromising data ownership or exposing sensitive indicators or insights. The PETs momentum began to build in the space arena this year as organisations worked together to design and build new space-based communications. In July 2022, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) announced the launch of its hybrid space architecture program (HSA), which aims to integrate commercial and government space assets to provide global, secure internet connectivity across multiple domains for commercial, civil, and military users, including international partners. This use case requires secure data sharing and collaboration, capabilities that can be uniquely provided by PETs. Leveraging the power of PETs, organisations can extract insights, cross-match, search, and analyse space-related data at scale in ways that are not otherwise possible. These capabilities are being woven into the fabric of projects like the HSA to help leverage both commercial and government space assets across diverse orbits to provide secure, assured, and low-latency data communications anywhere on and off Earth. In 2023, PETs will significantly help shape space as the mission landscape of the future where data interoperability, security, and access are critical to advancing any collaborative effort. I\u2019m really enthused by the advances we\u2019re likely to see in the space industry next year. No least the fact that 2023 will be marked by the first trials of \u2018direct to mobile\u2019 cellular connectivity from space, thanks to the growing constellation of low LEO satellites. The technology of these first-of-a-kind satellites features the huge phase-array antennas that will one day become the norm. No special user terminal is required, and they will work with a regular cell phone. AST Space Mobile are leading the way, but companies such as SpaceX have started their own design and development as competition hots up. Connectivity will start with text messaging services, but I predict this will be the catalyst for \u2018data everywhere\u2019 and a new gold rush for mobile network operators. Watch this space. Some other thoughts? Look out for innovations such as transparent phased array antennas, which will be a key and exciting area of research in 2023. Meanwhile, the coming 12 months will also see significant uptake for \u2018broadband from space\u2019 as the mega-constellations achieve operational status. The UK government has just announced a deal with Starlink to provide rural broadband coverage in certain parts of the country. The mega constellations target fixed wireless broadband and require dedicated terminal equipment. We\u2019re talking about a game-changer for some of the 3bn people in the world who have never used the internet. The technology is great for home and enterprise use, but there is increasing demand for \u2018comms on the move\u2019 and I anticipate further innovation that will enable high-speed data in current blackspots. I\u2019m thinking commercial aviation and maritime applications. As well as \u2018broadband from space\u2019 a quiet revolution has been happening in the \u2018remote IOT\u2019 world.  Satellites using narrowband technology enable COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) IoT devices to connect anywhere on the planet. 2023 will see initial trials and new commercial opportunities emerge as global low-cost, low-power data collection becomes a reality. And a final word \u2013 all of these new services require supporting infrastructure!.So, expect design and development of all of the following will advance in 2023: gas stations in space; assembly and maintenance vehicles in LEO; and network support infrastructure to include data trunking systems and backhaul plus data storage and processing.  Space solar power will be in increasingly discussed topic in as energy prices continue to rise and the need to address climate change intensifies. That means solar panels in space and energy transfer to earth using lasers or microwave beams. 2023? Bring it on. We saw a number of trends emerge in the spacetech sector in 2022, and we can only expect for them to continue throughout 2023. The burgeoning space industry will flourish as a result of the seeds sown in the previous year; an increasing budget, a global commitment to space exploration, and a growing awareness of the new space economy.  It\u2019s not only private individuals and venture capital firms that invest in space \u2013 the industry has both national and supranational backing. Towards the end of 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced a 17% rise in its budget, and it will be interesting to see how the region\u2019s space programme takes shape as this capital is distributed among nations.  Looking closer to home, the UK laid the foundations for a bright future in space this year. it\u2019s quite unlikely that there will be a rocket launch from UK soil in 2023. While Following the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Spaceflight Team, the Department of Transport and UK Space Agency\u2019s decision to granted grant the UK\u2019s first spaceport licence to Spaceport Cornwall, we will inevitably see how the intricacies of vertical launch sites still need are to be ironed out due to the complexities of those launches.  For Skyrora, in 2023 look forward to ensuring safe and responsible UK launch in the future through the granting of our launch vehicle licence application from the CAA, the application for which our talented team successfully completed and submitted earlier this year.we hope our launch operator licence application will be accepted.  This will of course bring us closer to our goal of orbital launch, and follows the momentum building milestones we achieved throughout 2022 to bring sovereign orbital launch capabilities to the UK. The technology is in place for the UK to have an agile and mobile launch infrastructure and market demand for a variety of in-orbit services is only going to grow stronger in the year ahead.

The space economy is rocketing into 2023 on a gravitational wave of big headlines. Billionaire man-children racing to be the first industrial tycoon of outer space have been responsible for an unproportionate chunk of those headlines. It\u2019s understandable that they have been the focal point of journalistic missives from around the world, but the founders of Amazon, Virgin and the Boring Company hardly represent the big picture of the space economy. Still, their endeavours catch people\u2019s imagination of a potential interstellar future \u2013 as well as providing setups for jokes and jibes. Jeff Bezos blasting himself into the lower reaches of the final frontier riding a penis-shaped rocket has been the comedic gift that keeps on giving.  Similarly, Richard Branson may be able to claim to have breached the lower barriers of space, but his decades-long struggle to transform Virgin Galactic into a profitable project are still long ways off, raising questions about the business plan behind the venture.  Elon Musk, the chided chief twit who\u2019s seen Tesla shares tank since his Twitter takeover, has not engaged in the same kind of space tourism endeavours as his billionaire kin \u2013 apart from selecting a passenger to join a Space X trip around the moon at some point in the future. However, he has arguably made an impact on a geopolitical scale by providing Ukraine with access to his Starlink satellite network to protect the nation\u2019s digital infrastructure and prevent internet outages amidst the Russian invasion.  Although, whatever goodwill he may have drummed up from Ukraine seemingly evaporated in October when he posted a Twitter poll suggesting that the country should just give up some occupied territories to Moscow in order to end the conflict. Ukraine\u2019s German ambassador Andry Melynk fired back with an angry tweet, not mincing his words. \u201cFuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,\u201d Melnyk tweeted, adding that the \u201conly outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f\u2026ing tesla crap. So good luck to you.\u201d Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk   While the noise from these billionaire projects is overpowering at times, they don\u2019t detract from the fact that the space economy is heading into 2023 on a promise of stratospheric potential.  Research and analyst firm GlobalData has forecast that the industry will be worth over $1tn by 2040. In a recent report, analysts from the firm noted that while defense deals, scientific progress and celebrity flights make up the bulk of headlines, other factors play an even bigger part in the industry\u2019s future.  These factors include technological advancements in space solar cells, network latency and reusable launches. These advancements are set to stimulate real growth in the space economy. In addition, the researchers estimated that the construction of space stations, space tourism and mining projects will make up a significant amount of commercial space activity by 2030.  In order to make heads and tails of the future of the space economy, we reached out to market stakeholders and experts to hear their predictions for what\u2019s to come in 2023. Check out what they had to say below. AI and machine learning to be applied more widely to analyse huge datasets generated in space. While AI and machine learning are already used in other sectors, practical applications in space are currently in their very early stages. In 2023, however, we will begin to see new capabilities applied more frequently when it comes to analysing huge datasets generated by satellites.  Currently, most sensors in space downlink everything they are trying to collect, which makes it difficult for those on the ground to pick out signals from the noise in a timely manner. Using AI and machine learning to analyse this data on board makes it possible to only downlink relevant pieces of information rather than sending the data set. The benefits will be significant for people on Earth, enabling us to better protect citizens in near real-time. The rapidly increasing number of satellites in orbit has been a theme in 2022 and this seems sure to continue in 2023. While the Starlink internet satellite constellation has the most satellites in orbit, other constellations are on the horizon including Kuiper and BlueBird.  With this rapid growth, there is increasing concern about the environmental impact of satellite constellations, including light pollution of the night sky, and this has been highlighted by a recent report by the US Government Accountability Office and the launch of BlueWalker 3 (a prototype for BlueBird). There should be several new rockets launched into orbit for the first time in 2023. The first SpaceX Starship may launch in December 2022, but this could easily slip in 2023. Starship could be a game changer for launching very massive payloads into orbit \u2013 particularly if its costs are as low as predicted. The first Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6 launchers are also planned for 2023 (amongst others), so the range of launchers available will look quite different in late-2023 to what it did 5 or 10 years ago. There will be many crewed spaceflights during 2023, including Crew Dragon, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the first (much delayed) crewed Starliner flight. Looking beyond 2023, excitingly, crewed circumlunar spaceflights with the Starship and Orion spacecraft are possibilities for 2024. There\u2019s plenty to look forward to in the space industry in 2023. The next year will be categorised by space tourism, exploration missions, innovation in the next generation CubeSats and excitement for the next Moon and Mars missions. One of the highly anticipated missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) interplanetary mission scheduled to launch in April 2023. The spacecraft will carry out mission studies to the Jupiter\u2019s moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa and will reach Jupiter in July 2031 after around eight years of travel. It will perform multiple gravity assists manoeuvre.  The spacecraft will eventually enter the orbit around Ganymede for its close-up mission, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than the moon of Earth. The JUICE mission will address two themes of ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme: What are the conditions for planet formation and emergence of life? and how does the Solar System work? The total mission duration is close to 11 years, of which about 3.5 years would be spent in the Jupiter system. The second anticipated mission is the Psyche mission and is scheduled to launch in October 2023. This is the first mission to a unique metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, to study the origins of its formation. Currently the mission is in the instrument, spacecraft assembly and testing phase and will be launched by NASA. This mission will shed light on the formation of the rocky planet with iron core. It could help in understanding the formation of our planet with iron core in the centre.  The successful launch of NASA Artemis 1 and all the future mission to Moon, Mars and beyond will propel more enthusiasm in the next generation of students to choose the STEM subjects. I am sure 2023 is going to be another exciting year for all the space enthusiasts and it will certainly ignite spark of curiosity in young space explorers to look beyond the horizon as sky is not the limit.  In 2023, space innovation will become even more vital for boosting defences and delivering advantages on Earth, especially in a time of increased conflict and tension. We\u2019ll therefore see more emphasis on growing the sector in line with the government\u2019s National Space and Defence Space Strategies. As part of this growth in innovation, a greater focus will be placed on involving smaller organisations in defence programmes and contracts. For this to happen, the relationship between \u2018primes\u2019 and SMEs will need to evolve beyond supply chains, which means working together in a new, dynamic way. Not only will this collaboration help smaller organisations in the space sector to grow, but it will also enable \u2018primes\u2019 to deliver enhanced capabilities to customers.  The onus is also on customers to encourage collaboration by outlining it in contracts and development programmes. Risk levels increase when working with smaller organisations, which is something customers will have to accept and build into programmes. Within all sectors, there is no doubt that sustainability will be a key focus in 2023 and beyond. For organisations within the space sector, there are two very different areas they need to address.  The first relates to the organisations themselves. Many will continue to find ways to develop capabilities in a sustainable way to meet the net-zero targets. This might include switching to clean energy sources and electric propulsion to working in partnership with other organisations to introduce new green initiatives. The second links to sustainability in space. There is currently a growing amount of junk and debris in space, which is leading to a sustainability dilemma. Over the coming years, we will see more efforts to build awareness around the impact of satellite launches and deploying new equipment, as well as removing dead satellites. We can also expect to see the sector innovate to increase the life expectancy and versatility of satellites.  At BAE Systems, for example, we\u2019ve partnered with in-space missions to invest in satellites that are reprogrammable. Moving away from deployment and launch for a single mission, providing reconfigurable, mission-specific satellites that can refuel and re-equip in the longer term will be critical. The first major satellite hack [is coming]. From the attacks on ViaSat via supply chain vulnerabilities which exposed the ground terminal, to more recent threats against Starlink low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, events in 2022 have indicated that the space race is far from over. In 2023, the focus will continue to shift towards satellite compromise, with the first major satellite hack to be expected in the next 12 months. This will likely involve all three main attack vectors: ground, communication links and payload hijacking.  From the ground station perspective, it is highly possible that vulnerabilities in physical security will be targeted. Leveraging the cost-of-living crisis, malicious actors could exploit insiders to gain direct access to satellite operations centres and mission operations centres. This will enable them to take control of spacecraft, disable communication links or capture all earthbound transmissions. Communication links will also be a prime target in the coming years. Earth-to-LEO satellite communications are vulnerable as spacecraft are frequently passing over potentially hostile territory. The adversary can use satellite blinding as these satellites pass to capture critical imagery or radio frequency data.  Lastly, poorly developed DevSecOps principles could see the introduction of malware based on the reliance on COTs code bases. A lack of understanding around code and applications could allow an attacker to hide on spacecraft payload and run tasks undetected. While the category may fall outside of what would traditionally be considered relevant to advances in the space industry, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) will play a pivotal role in the exploration of space communications in 2023.  The reason can be summarised in one word: data. While there are clearly many unique and interesting aspects about the space environment, the ability to securely and privately leverage the vast volume of space-related data across boundaries at scale is foundational to advancing our collective capabilities.    No matter where it takes place and the value it can provide, ubiquitous data usage is not without its challenges. Data is the backbone of the digital economy and organisations across all sectors are increasingly having to balance value extraction and risk management. The pace of change has left regulators and lawmakers scrambling to keep up, which frequently leads to a lack of clarity. PETs enable, enhance, and preserve the privacy of data throughout its lifecycle, allowing entities to achieve secure and private data usage without compromising data ownership or exposing sensitive indicators or insights.

ITF on Wednesday organised an event for textile professionals on use of modern technology in spinning.  Addressing the occasion, Dhamodharan said, \u201cthe focus now among textile spinning units was on use of less space and energy and achieve high productivity.\u201d Robotics is getting into machinery on a larger scale and the entire management of the shop floor and monitoring production processes are going digital, he said, adding that automation is increasing at all friction points in the production process. Dhamodharan pointed out that it is possible to make changes on a daily basis with data available from the machinery and use of artificial intelligence to get better productivity.

This past year, long-form Horizons stories delved into the technologies that could dictate our future, including everything from cancer-destroying bacteria to a satellite-flinging launch station. Inverse\u2019s in-depth reporting spanned forward-looking fields like artificial intelligence, renewable energy, robotics, and private space travel. As 2022 comes to a close, a few stories stand out as the wildest, most inspiring breakthroughs. Here\u2019s our list of the best Horizons stories of the year. As the private space race heats up, entrepreneurs are beginning to tackle the elephant in the room: the massive amounts of waste they leave behind in the final frontier. In recent years, space magnates have decided to incorporate reusable components into their rockets, though it isn\u2019t entirely out of environmental concern \u2014 they also want to reduce operating costs. Here\u2019s how space companies are going green-ish. As global demand for electric vehicles surges, it has become clear that we\u2019re going to need tons of lithium for lithium-ion batteries. The sought-after metal is usually sourced from mines in Latin America, Australia, and China, but the world\u2019s supply is limited \u2014 hence the recent sky-high lithium prices that are driving up the cost of EVs. But a solution to this dilemma could lie in a salt lake in California\u2019s desert, where the lithium leftovers from geothermal plants may help satiate our appetite for EVs. Read the story here. Star Wars fans may have noticed that the resurrected young Luke Skywalker sounded a bit strange in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. While some media outlets claimed that the CGI character had a completely synthesized voice, the production process wasn\u2019t quite so simple. It was, in fact, based on Mark Hamill\u2019s voice: A Ukrainian tech company fed an AI old audio recordings. This type of technology could change the film industry forever. If you spent any time on Twitter over the past year, you likely encountered mind-bending memes that feel like screenshots from a fever dream \u2014 take, for example, images of Yoda robbing a liquor store, Guy Fieri giving a TED talk, or an octopus assembling Ikea furniture. We can thank machine-learning engineer Boris Dayma for democratizing the meme-making AI platform, DALL-E Mini. Here\u2019s how (and why) he did it. Automatons have gotten pretty good at preparing food, whether it be flipping burgers or assembling pizzas. But scientists have long struggled to give them a crucial culinary ability: taste. This past spring, a team from the University of Cambridge laid out a technique to help bots assess a key dish characteristic. But can human chefs ever really be replaced? Dig in here. Thanks to today\u2019s wide selection of electric vehicles, cross-country road trips need no longer entail carbon-spewing cars. But treks in a Tesla or Nissan Leaf still aren\u2019t as convenient as voyages done in gas-powered vehicles.

The masts, which unfold from opposite sides of the spacecraft, can be seen extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place, but the cameras stopped short of capturing the antennas at the ends of the masts being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data). This video places the two camera views side by side. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite launched into Earth orbit on Friday, Dec. 16, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California, and engineers are working to prepare the mission to begin measuring the height of water on over 90% of Earth\u2019s surface, providing a high-definition survey of our planet\u2019s water for the first time. But before it can do that, the satellite would need to unfold its large mast and antenna panels (see above) after successfully deploying the solar panel arrays that power the spacecraft. The mission monitors and controls the satellite using telemetry data, but it also equipped spacecraft with four customized commercial cameras to record the action. The solar arrays fully deployed shortly after launch, taking about 10 minutes. This series of images shows the deployment of the solar arrays that power the international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. The mission, led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES), captured the roughly 10-minute process with two of the four commercial cameras aboard the satellite (the same type used to capture NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover landing on Mars). SWOT launched Dec. 16, 2022, at 3:46 a.m. PST from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, and the arrays started their deployment at 5:01 a.m. PST. The antennas successfully deployed over four days, a process that was completed on Dec. 22. The two cameras focused on the KaRIn antennas captured the mast extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place but stopped short of capturing the antennas being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data.) Thirty-three feet (10 meters) apart, at either end of the mast, the two antennas belong to the groundbreaking Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument. Designed to capture precise measurements of the height of water in Earth\u2019s freshwater bodies and the ocean, KaRIn will see eddies, currents, and other ocean features less than 13 miles (20 kilometers) across. It will also collect data on lakes and reservoirs larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across. This illustration shows the SWOT spacecraft with its antenna mast and solar arrays fully deployed. KaRIn will do this by bouncing radar pulses off the surface of water on Earth and receiving the signals with both of those antennas, collecting data along a swath that\u2019s 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide on either side of the satellite. The data SWOT provides will help researchers and decision-makers address some of the most pressing climate questions of our time and help communities prepare for a warming world. Get the Latest JPL News SWOT was jointly developed by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA is providing the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. CNES is providing the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the satellite platform, and ground operations. CSA is providing the KaRIn high-power transmitter assembly.

The masts, which unfold from opposite sides of the spacecraft, can be seen extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place, but the cameras stopped short of capturing the antennas at the ends of the masts being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data). This video places the two camera views side by side. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite launched into Earth orbit on Friday, Dec. 16, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California, and engineers are working to prepare the mission to begin measuring the height of water on over 90% of Earth\u2019s surface, providing a high-definition survey of our planet\u2019s water for the first time. But before it can do that, the satellite would need to unfold its large mast and antenna panels (see above) after successfully deploying the solar panel arrays that power the spacecraft. The mission monitors and controls the satellite using telemetry data, but it also equipped spacecraft with four customized commercial cameras to record the action. The solar arrays fully deployed shortly after launch, taking about 10 minutes. This series of images shows the deployment of the solar arrays that power the international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. The mission, led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES), captured the roughly 10-minute process with two of the four commercial cameras aboard the satellite (the same type used to capture NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover landing on Mars). SWOT launched Dec. 16, 2022, at 3:46 a.m. PST from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, and the arrays started their deployment at 5:01 a.m. PST. The antennas successfully deployed over four days, a process that was completed on Dec. 22. The two cameras focused on the KaRIn antennas captured the mast extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place but stopped short of capturing the antennas being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data.) Thirty-three feet (10 meters) apart, at either end of the mast, the two antennas belong to the groundbreaking Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument. Designed to capture precise measurements of the height of water in Earth\u2019s freshwater bodies and the ocean, KaRIn will see eddies, currents, and other ocean features less than 13 miles (20 kilometers) across. It will also collect data on lakes and reservoirs larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across. This illustration shows the SWOT spacecraft with its antenna mast and solar arrays fully deployed. KaRIn will do this by bouncing radar pulses off the surface of water on Earth and receiving the signals with both of those antennas, collecting data along a swath that\u2019s 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide on either side of the satellite. The data SWOT provides will help researchers and decision-makers address some of the most pressing climate questions of our time and help communities prepare for a warming world.

The masts, which unfold from opposite sides of the spacecraft, can be seen extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place, but the cameras stopped short of capturing the antennas at the ends of the masts being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data). This video places the two camera views side by side. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite launched into Earth orbit on Friday, Dec. 16, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California, and engineers are working to prepare the mission to begin measuring the height of water on over 90% of Earth\u2019s surface, providing a high-definition survey of our planet\u2019s water for the first time. But before it can do that, the satellite would need to unfold its large mast and antenna panels (see above) after successfully deploying the solar panel arrays that power the spacecraft. The mission monitors and controls the satellite using telemetry data, but it also equipped spacecraft with four customized commercial cameras to record the action. The solar arrays fully deployed shortly after launch, taking about 10 minutes. This series of images shows the deployment of the solar arrays that power the international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. The mission, led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES), captured the roughly 10-minute process with two of the four commercial cameras aboard the satellite (the same type used to capture NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover landing on Mars). SWOT launched Dec. 16, 2022, at 3:46 a.m. PST from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, and the arrays started their deployment at 5:01 a.m. PST. The antennas successfully deployed over four days, a process that was completed on Dec. 22. The two cameras focused on the KaRIn antennas captured the mast extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place but stopped short of capturing the antennas being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data.) Thirty-three feet (10 meters) apart, at either end of the mast, the two antennas belong to the groundbreaking Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument. Designed to capture precise measurements of the height of water in Earth\u2019s freshwater bodies and the ocean, KaRIn will see eddies, currents, and other ocean features less than 13 miles (20 kilometers) across. It will also collect data on lakes and reservoirs larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across. This illustration shows the SWOT spacecraft with its antenna mast and solar arrays fully deployed. KaRIn will do this by bouncing radar pulses off the surface of water on Earth and receiving the signals with both of those antennas, collecting data along a swath that\u2019s 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide on either side of the satellite. The data SWOT provides will help researchers and decision-makers address some of the most pressing climate questions of our time and help communities prepare for a warming world.

The masts, which unfold from opposite sides of the spacecraft, can be seen extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place, but the cameras stopped short of capturing the antennas at the ends of the masts being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data). This video places the two camera views side by side. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite launched into Earth orbit on Friday, Dec. 16, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California, and engineers are working to prepare the mission to begin measuring the height of water on over 90% of Earth\u2019s surface, providing a high-definition survey of our planet\u2019s water for the first time. But before it can do that, the satellite would need to unfold its large mast and antenna panels (see above) after successfully deploying the solar panel arrays that power the spacecraft. The mission monitors and controls the satellite using telemetry data, but it also equipped spacecraft with four customized commercial cameras to record the action. The solar arrays fully deployed shortly after launch, taking about 10 minutes. This series of images shows the deployment of the solar arrays that power the international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. The mission, led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES), captured the roughly 10-minute process with two of the four commercial cameras aboard the satellite (the same type used to capture NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover landing on Mars). SWOT launched Dec. 16, 2022, at 3:46 a.m. PST from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, and the arrays started their deployment at 5:01 a.m. PST. The antennas successfully deployed over four days, a process that was completed on Dec. 22. The two cameras focused on the KaRIn antennas captured the mast extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place but stopped short of capturing the antennas being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data.) Thirty-three feet (10 meters) apart, at either end of the mast, the two antennas belong to the groundbreaking Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument. Designed to capture precise measurements of the height of water in Earth\u2019s freshwater bodies and the ocean, KaRIn will see eddies, currents, and other ocean features less than 13 miles (20 kilometers) across. It will also collect data on lakes and reservoirs larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across. This illustration shows the SWOT spacecraft with its antenna mast and solar arrays fully deployed. KaRIn will do this by bouncing radar pulses off the surface of water on Earth and receiving the signals with both of those antennas, collecting data along a swath that\u2019s 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide on either side of the satellite. The data SWOT provides will help researchers and decision-makers address some of the most pressing climate questions of our time and help communities prepare for a warming world. Get the Latest JPL News SWOT was jointly developed by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA is providing the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. CNES is providing the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the satellite platform, and ground operations. CSA is providing the KaRIn high-power transmitter assembly. NASA is providing the launch vehicle and the agency\u2019s Launch Services Program, based at Kennedy Space Center, is managing the associated launch services.
