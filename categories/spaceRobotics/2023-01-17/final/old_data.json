Dr. Jason Y.K. Chan, the co-founder of Agilis RoboticsTM , conducted the test with the firm's second-generation device on a live pig specimen and successfully removed artificial tumors using the en-bloc resection of bladder tumor (ERBT) technique. The test results met expectations, demonstrating promising results for the accuracy, safety, and efficacy of the firm's medical robotic system.\n\nDrawing on the advice of surgeons in earlier experiments, the research team has made several technical improvements to the original system that increased the efficiency of the surgery.\n\nThe 2nd generation prototype system has been optimized for more streamlined surgical control\n\nThe Agilis RoboticsTM system is a surgical robotic solution designed for endoscopic surgery. The system features a set of flexible surgical robotic instruments, a positioning cart and a surgeon's control chair. The flexible robotic instruments, with a diameter of less than 2.8 mm, can grip and cut away tumor tissue to remove it in its entirety.\n\nThe second-generation prototype system used in this test includes several improvements over the original system. With a smaller footprint, the updated positioning cart is 50% smaller, making it highly compact and easily positioned in the operating room.\n\nSecond, the newly developed endoscope holder offers the surgeon great flexibility for positioning the endoscope and robotic instruments. During operation, the surgeon can move the endoscope with ease using just one hand in thanks to the holder's sensor. The holder includes an automatic locking mechanism that prevents the unit from moving around freely, streamlining the surgeon's work and improving the procedure's safety.\n\nThe surgical tools have also been improved in this prototype iteration, allowing the surgeon to visualize the surgical field beyond the instruments more clearly and increase its load capacity to meet more demanding requirements. The electrosurgical knife instrument was also improved to enable bipolar diathermy, which substantially enhances tissue cutting effectiveness in bladder tumor resection. The most notable improvements are made to the controls and mechanical transmission in terms of precision and reduced control latency. This gives the surgeon a more intuitive and responsive control experience compared with manual operation. In addition to the controls, the team has also made substantial improvements to the system's ergonomic design and training simulator.\n\nNext, the company will test the system in animals for upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). This will be a major milestone for the company, demonstrating their potential within the sizeable market for GI diseases.\n\nAgilis RoboticsTM invited prominent gastroenterology and hepatology specialist Dr. Peter Chan Chun Wing to evaluate the system before its entry into the digestive tract market. Dr. Chan has almost 20 years of medical specialty practice, focusing on endoscopy and GI surgery. Dr. Chan is listed as a colonoscopy provider to the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme of the Hong Kong Department of Health, offering pre-screening advice and colonoscopies for eligible individuals.\n\nAs the first internal medicine physician to use the system, Dr. Chan not only carried out ev-vivo tissue resection tests but also offered guidance on the system's potential for the GI market. He foresees the system's accessibility in general endoscopy clinics and centers, which is crucial to making the system widely adopted throughout healthcare institutions.\n\nAgilis RoboticsTM is challenging convention with its unmatched intuitiveness as minimally invasive endoscopic procedures are rapidly evolving\n\nA large number of new minimally invasive endoscopic techniques, including EMR (endoscopic mucosal resection) and ESD, have emerged to combat the increased detection of submucosal tumors, early cancers, and precancerous lesions in the digestive tract, which is a positive outcome due to rise in health awareness among the general population. By eliminating external incisions and promoting quick recovery, the practical use of these techniques has improved patient outcomes and decreased discomfort.\n\nEndoscopic minimally-invasive interventional techniques have evolved quickly in recent years and are becoming more important in the treatment of digestive disorders.\n\nInterventional procedures are more popular with patients as they are less invasive and require a shorter hospital stay. By enabling complete excision of diseased tissue while maintaining the normal function of the digestive tract, the approach can reduce the risk of post-operative complications such as infection associated with surgical operations (e.g., major surgery such as open-heart and open-abdomen).\n\nPatients who received endoscopic surgery recover quickly and stay in the hospital for a much shorter time\u2014usually 2 to 3 days or less\u2014before being discharged. The cost of treatment is only 1/3 to 1/2 of a general surgery. Industry insiders have said that although general surgery costs between 20,000 and 40,000 yuan, endoscopic minimally-invasive procedures can be managed for as little as 20,000 yuan.\n\nIn contrast to previous prototype tests, the company invited laypeople with no medical professionals to observe. They briefly used a virtual training simulator and then carried out tissue dissection in an ex-vivo tissue model.\n\nParticipants commented, \"The Agilis surgical robot is remarkable, even for an unskilled learner, as it can already remove artificial tumors from ex-vivo tissue after around 20 minutes of training with the simulator.\" The visitors claimed that the technology is simple to use and requires little training. Doctors skilled in endoscopic procedures must be able to pick up the skills quickly. They also expressed optimism about the device's commercialization potential.\n\nThe Agilis system also aims to support training using artificial intelligence (AI). Empirical endoscopic imaging is used in the AI system for deep learning to enhance the operator's surgical training. The learning curve for performing en-bloc tumor resection should be greatly reduced, as compared to manual ESD operations which are only performed by surgeons with extensive experience.\n\nA US$100 million firm focused on creating robotic equipment for endoscopic surgery\n\nSurgical robots in laparoscopy, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, vascular intervention, and other specialties are now popular topics in China. Businesses, however, need to think about how to break through the bottleneck of technological innovation in light of the highly competitive market.\n\nSeveral challenges have been identified in the course of developing robots for endoscopic surgery. For example, general endoscope working channels (2.8\u20133.7mm in diameter), require considerable flexibility to adapt to the changing shape as the endoscope travels through the narrow passageways within human body, resulting in high demands for the size and ergonomic design of the overall system.\n\nAgilis RoboticsTM is the first company to develop such a robotic system to overcome these challenges. The company has created a surgical robotic device that can seamlessly integrate with existing surgical procedures, notably for the GI and urological systems, to boost surgical efficiency and reduce the learning curve for endoscopic surgery. The firm's robotic instruments are totally flexible and has achieved a range of technological achievements.\n\nAs a kind of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), endoscopic surgery is distinct from laparoscopy and requires a notably different set of technological skills. Major global players such as Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, and Medtronic have developed their own surgical robotic systems, however none are working with the approach of utilizing conventional endoscopes and their working channels. Presently, R&D for NOTES is focused on the bronchial sector in China, none of which has received approval for use in the country as well.\n\nAccording to the US-based business consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, the global NOTES robot market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 88.2% from 2016 to 2026, maintaining significant growth, and is on track to reach 12.53 billion yuan by 2026 from 457 million yuan in 2020.\n\nThere is still room for growth in the market for endoscopic surgery robots for the urology and digestive systems. As the first Chinese business to build an endoscopic surgery robot, Agilis RoboticsTM has a head start on the competition in the market with a product that is already taking shape and has plans for pre-clinical testing.\n\nThe second-generation prototype used has optimized the structure and integration of the firm's flexible robot instruments in many ways. \"Our next step is to improve the robotics control and console's design and control features in a move to further improve surgical accuracy and efficiency,\" Agilis RoboticsTM revealed. The company is planning for next iteration prototype testing, and expects to complete the first human trial in the coming two years.\n\nIn June 2022, Agilis RoboticsTM closed its Series A fundraising. Joe Hui, co-founder and CFO, said that the advanced prototype will be delivered to The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital in the second quarter of this year for additional testing. The company will also wrap up its NMPA testing in the third quarter of 2023 and then start a PRE-B round of funding with a minimum investment of US$10 million. The COVID-19 outbreak last year prevented investors from visiting to Hong Kong for test and experience the system in Series A roadshows. Now, in an effort to entice investors, the company has established a special Series A+ of US$5 million.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agilis-roboticstm-completes-new-round-of-live-animal-trials-with-miniaturized-robotic-instruments-for-endoscopic-surgery-301721505.html\n\nSOURCE Agilis Robotics Limited", "title": "Agilis RoboticsTM Completes New Round of Live Animal Trials with Miniaturized Robotic Instruments for Endoscopic Surgery", "keywords": ["roboticstm", "instruments", "live", "surgical", "trials", "system", "agilis", "round", "miniaturized", "completes", "surgery", "endoscopic", "prototype", "robotic", "tissue", "company"], "link": "https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/agilis-roboticstm-completes-new-round-of-live-animal-trials-with-miniaturized-robotic-instruments-for-endoscopic-surgery/", "skip": "false", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n7/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 7, "summary": "\n\nAgilis RoboticsTM, a US$100 million firm, has recently completed the second round of live animal testing using its proprietary robotic device.

They were either remotely controlled by humans or ran fixed scripts that allowed for virtually no latitude in terms of how they operated or what they did. Even though I was born in the year Robby the Robot became famous, the robots I grew up with weren\u2019t anything like Robby. They were about as smart as an old toaster.\n\nFortunately, that\u2019s changing. Robotics has advanced considerably over the last decade, partially thanks to the leading work Nvidia has done with autonomous vehicles, much of which translated into autonomous robotics. This year at CES, the top robots all seemed to have Nvidia brains, starting with a robotic tractor from John Deere and ending with Gl\u00fcxKind, an AI-powered baby stroller I want to buy for my aging dog.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the Nvidia-powered robots at CES this week. We\u2019ll close with my Product of the Week, a wireless microphone that may keep me from getting into a fight on my next plane trip.\n\nJohn Deere Autonomous Tractor\n\nJohn Deere won the Best of Innovation award for its robotic tractor.\n\nJohn Deere Fully Autonomous Tractor | Image Credit: Deere & Company\n\nI grew up working on a farm. While driving a tractor was fun at first, it got tedious very quickly.\n\nThe heat and the repetition of driving in long rows were broken up only by the excitement of an equipment failure or the potential for a grizzly death should I fall asleep and fall off the tractor. That actually happened years later to the head of my division at IBM, who died when he fell off his tractor into a plow.\n\nJohn Deere\u2019s tractor won\u2019t get bored, tired, or die, so farmers can work on other things that need doing, given that staffing farms has become a big problem of late. Historically, robots weren\u2019t affordable on farms because labor was cheap. But you can\u2019t get those workers now, and getting locals to work on a farm is just as difficult.\n\nSo, if farmers want to keep operating, they need to automate, suggesting the farm of the future may be run entirely by increasingly intelligent robots and robotic equipment. So, this tractor may be critical to ensuring we have food on our tables in the future.\n\nAgrist Harvesting Robot\n\nAnother robot was from Agrist. I\u2019m not a fan of this one mainly because it was built to harvest bell peppers and bell peppers trigger my gag reflex. Just the smell of the things makes me feel ill. Still, if I had to harvest bell peppers (clearly one of my concepts of hell), I\u2019d appreciate a robot like this that kept my hands, nose, and tongue well away from the horrid things.\n\nSometimes you have to grow stuff you don\u2019t like, and this robot would assure me that if I still had a farm \u2014 which thankfully I don\u2019t \u2014 I could grow bell peppers and harvest them without ever getting that close to the darn things.\n\nSeriously, this robot is designed to work in indoor factory farms, which will be crucial to the survival of countries being badly impacted by climate change and losing the ability to farm as a result. Robots like this will be critical to sustaining humanity as the climate makes outdoor agriculture obsolete.\n\nSkydio Scout Drone\n\nDrones were also covered, with the Skydio drone standing out for its Scout drone.\n\nSkydio is a fascinating drone company. It even has a docked drone solution that reminds me of the old Green Hornet TV show. Can you imagine having one of these on your car so you can check what has caused the traffic jam you are stuck in? Or envision a police officer on a high-speed chase being able to launch one of these and have it autonomously and secretly follow the suspect, so they didn\u2019t have to risk life and limb chasing them in a car.\n\nSkydio drones are used in law enforcement, fire and rescue, power line inspection, construction, transportation, telecommunications, and defense.\n\nSkydio is a powerful company with an increasingly powerful set of autonomous products that may save your life one day, making this potentially one of the most important products launched at CES this year.\n\nGl\u00fcxKind \u2018Ella\u2019 AI-Powered Stroller\n\nI was looking for a powered stroller for my aging dog just a few weeks ago. When the dog gets tired on walks, we put her in a stroller, but pushing the thing up hills gets old. When my wife walks all three of our dogs alone, managing the stroller at the same time has become tedious and potentially unsafe.\n\nWhen empty, the Gl\u00fcxKind Ella stroller will follow you (I don\u2019t want to imagine a runaway with a baby in it). When occupied, it\u2019s battery-assisted to go up hills where my wife often struggles (I\u2019m currently her solution for going up hills).\n\nGl\u00fcxkind was named a CES 2023 Innovation Awards Honoree for its \u201cElla\u201d smart stroller. | Image Credit: Gl\u00fcxkind Technologies\n\nSadly, its current configuration won\u2019t work for my dog. Otherwise, I\u2019d probably order one. But trying to teach a 14-year-old dog to sit up in a stroller like a baby is a non-starter, though it would likely give others a bit of a shock when we walked by. Still, for parents with several children or walking their dog and kid at the same time, this powered stroller could be a winner.\n\nNow, if they\u2019d just come up with a pet configuration, I\u2019d be in.\n\nNeubility Delivery Robot\n\nThe Neubility self-driving robot, named Neubie, is one of the new delivery robots coming to market.\n\nI\u2019m a bit concerned about this class of robots. In trials, kids and some adults often abuse and break into these robots when in use. The Neubie is bigger and more robust than many I\u2019ve seen, but I speculate it may need some kind of defense or high-speed escape capability to work in the real world.\n\nThe onboard cameras should catch and record anyone that harms it, but it may be a while before people just leave the thing alone to do its job. For this reason, Neubility is smartly targeting golf courses where the robot can be better protected. Places like resorts, hospitals, and factories will be where robots like this can operate most successfully.\n\nI\u2019ll wait to see if they develop one with a built-in taser before I put a lot of faith in delivery robots outside of controlled environments like golf courses and resorts.\n\nStill, once accepted and protected, robots in this class will likely make delivery to homes by humans a thing of the past, better assure you are home to receive the delivery and make life much harder for porch pirates, whom I hate with a newly found passion after this past Christmas.\n\nSeoul Robotics LV5 Control Tower for Autonomous Parking\n\nSeoul Robotics showcased a Level 5 control tower, an interesting alternative to the typical way autonomous cars are currently configured. It uses infrastructure external to the vehicle to manage the automobile, potentially enabling any current-generation car with Level 2 technology that is connected to that grid to operate autonomously.\n\nThis variant is interesting because, rather than thinking of autonomous cars like they are now, it thinks of them more like how an aircraft traffic controller does by monitoring all the cars in range and directing from a central resource. Eventually, this technology could replace things like traffic lights, effectively moving them into the vehicle when it is being driven by humans and making them invisible to people riding in autonomous cars.\n\nNot only could this approach be much cheaper than putting this technology in every car, but it would also shift maintenance from the car owner to the government, which may maintain it better, though this isn\u2019t always a given.\n\nIt could also help ensure fewer catastrophic problems and allow older cars to better interoperate with newer autonomous vehicles while providing a viable low-cost upgrade for those that wanted to make recent cars that are currently not autonomous work as if they were. This is arguably the most innovative approach to the autonomous car problem I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019m fascinated by it.\n\nWhill Autonomous Wheelchair\n\nFinally, Whill presented its autonomous wheelchair designed for people with limited mobility and sight. Aging or partially disabled folks who also can\u2019t see well are pretty much dependent on others because the white cane approach doesn\u2019t work in wheelchairs.\n\nWinner of the Best of Innovation award in the accessibility category, this wheelchair has unique high-traction tires and a rear bin for packages or groceries. It looks a bit like something out of a science fiction movie.\n\nWith a range of 12 miles, the ability to climb over 3-inch objects like curbs, and very high stability for rough streets, this could be ideal for aging seniors and those with sight and mobility problems. At 5.5 mph, it is anything but blazing fast, but if you have a mobility and sight problem, you probably don\u2019t want blazing fast.\n\nWeighing in at 250 pounds, it is lighter than many motorized solutions for those with limited mobility, and its autonomous capabilities provide independence that some people can\u2019t get any other way.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThis list of robots at CES is not exhaustive, but I realized that most of the robots I looked at had Nvidia brains, so I figured I\u2019d use that as a theme for this column. The autonomous robot revolution is just beginning, with the hope we never go so far as to make the book Robopocalypse real.\n\nOver the next decade, these will be coming out at an increasing pace, and Nvidia has placed itself at the heart (well, maybe more at the brain) of these efforts. Eventually, we may be like George Jetson and have a Rosie-like maid that is autonomous, robotic, and with just the right level of snark.\n\nAt CES, I saw our robotic future. I can\u2019t wait until I have my own Rosie!\n\nMutalk VR Microphone\n\nBefore Christmas, I took my last trip of the year to New York. Before takeoff on the return flight, I had to do a radio interview over the phone. While the person next to me was okay with this, the guy in front of me was not and seemed to be about to punch me out because I was talking too loudly. I have a trained media voice, and it carries a long way.\n\nHaving a solution I could use when doing these things could be a lifesaver, particularly if we get to the point where we are making inflight phone calls and don\u2019t want to piss off or accidentally entertain everyone else on the plane with our conversations \u2014 let alone accidentally share confidential or personal information.\n\nThe Mutalk VR microphone was one of two products launched at CES that can contain your voice when speaking.\n\nI\u2019m picking the Mutalk because it was also designed to work with a VR rig which, given I play in VR, made it more attractive to me than its counterpart, the mask by Skyted, which was far larger and explicitly designed for inflight use. Frankly, I\u2019d be fine with either, and I must admit the full Mutalk rig might also be a bit much on a plane.\n\nIn the end, having something I could use for calls in areas with lots of ambient noise or when I need to speak loudly might get me punched out would be a godsend. So, the Mutalk leakage voice suppression microphone is my Product of the Week.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ECT News Network.", "title": "The Hottest Robots at CES Had Nvidia Brains", "keywords": ["tractor", "autonomous", "ces", "robot", "stroller", "farm", "nvidia", "id", "work", "brains", "robotic", "robots", "hottest"], "link": "https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-hottest-robots-at-ces-had-nvidia-brains-177653.html", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n3/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 3}, "8": {"text": "A team called PoliMOVE, from Politecnico di Milano in Italy, has won the second annual Indy Autonomous Challenge @ CES.\n\nThe team\u2019s car reached a maximum speed of 180 mph (290Km/h), a new autonomous speed world record for a racetrack.\n\nPushing boundaries of head-to-head autonomous-racing, PoliMOVE competed at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway against a field of nine teams from 17 universities spanning six countries, seeking to break autonomous racing records.\n\nTUM Autonomous Motorsport from Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (Germany) took second place in the heated battle.

In addition, the production of industrial robots rises at similar rates annually.\n\nThe impact rapid production of industrial robots will have on the future of work are wide-ranging.\n\nApart from boosting the robotics industry, the CDC says when used with a safety-first mentality, these robots can make industrial work safer, quicker, and more productive for workers.\n\nThe evidence is clear, there will be more robots in the future of work. Industrial jobs, in particular, will increasingly involve robotics.\n\nA report from the Federation of Robotics revealed that industrial robotics installations and orders currently exceed pre-pandemic levels, which will only continue increasing as time goes on.\n\nThis trend ranges globally, with Asia ranking as the leading continent in robotics production.\n\nWhen discussing robots entering the workforce, images of dystopian futures of extreme unemployment readily come to mind.\n\nGiven its benefits, however, the rapid production of industrial robots is a positive development. The CDC states that when robotics is used with a safety-first mentality, they can substantially improve working conditions in factories and other industrial contexts.\n\nThe future of work and the future of robots\n\nThe robotics industry produced over half a million industrial robots globally last year alone, and this annual rate is going to continue to increase.\n\nThis does not mean that all industrial jobs will disappear and be replaced through automation. On the contrary, since the 1980s, with the decline of manufacturing and industrial jobs in the United States, there has still not been an abolition of industrial employment altogether.\n\nInstead, working conditions dramatically improved in industrial jobs due to the use of new technology. In this age of mass production of industrial robots, we should expect similar trends.\n\nThe benefits of robotics for the industrial workforce\n\nThe CDC is optimistic about the effect of robotics on industrial workers globally. This is especially the case compared to other industries far newer to automation, such as agriculture, construction, and mining.\n\nFor that reason, the CDC considers these newly automated places of work as less controlled and unsafe work environments for robots to be involved in.\n\nThese places of work are more connected to the public than manufacturing jobs, making the less controlled environment even less safe for robots to work in.\n\nTraditionally, industrial robots have improved working conditions in manufacturing jobs by making them safer, quicker, more productive, and easing working conditions.\n\nThis is partially because workers and robots did not work side-by-side in these settings but were physically separated by a cage for safety reasons.\n\nThat is now changing in manufacturing with the rapid advancement of technology. For example, industrial robots now work physically side-by-side with industrial workers.\n\nHowever, the increased use of industrial robotics and their proximity to workers in dangerous environments is a double-edged sword for worker safety, health, and wellness.\n\nThe potential to improve worker safety results from robots being able to cover for workers on hazardous tasks.\n\nBut, there are safety concerns that robots could injure workers by accident \u2014 for instance, by distracting them from workplace safety hazards.\n\nAnother worry the CDC expresses is that robots could mentally stress workers. For example, workers can perceive robot coworkers negatively, such as ignorance of how the robot works, mistrust in its ability to do the job, or the fear of being replaced by it.\n\nThe CDC states it is more likely that the positives will outweigh the negatives if companies and workers create and abide by strict safety protocols related to the robots.\n\nBecause no governing body has established protocols, companies must conduct operations with industrial robots with a safety-first mentality to ensure worker safety and wellness.", "title": "AI Is Transforming The Future Of Industrial Work", "keywords": ["jobs", "working", "robotics", "workers", "safety", "production", "future", "ai", "work", "transforming", "cdc", "robots", "industrial"], "link": "https://allwork.space/2023/01/ai-is-transforming-the-future-of-industrial-work/", "skip": "false", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n7/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 7, "summary": "\n\nSummary: The production of industrial robots has risen dramatically in recent years, leading the CDC to suggest that their integration into the workforce will have wide-ranging benefits when used with a safety-first mentality.

As a result, it is now possible to perform complex tasks like object detection, facial recognition, and 3D reconstruction in a short amount of time. Especially in the 3D domain, advancements in computer vision and graphics have allowed for the development of computer-based games, proof-of-concept 3D movies and animation, and options for virtual and augmented reality experiences. Furthermore, many applications in computer vision and graphics are close to being or have already been addressed with the help of deep learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThese methods are based on artificial neural networks, which are used to learn complex patterns in data. Deep learning networks are hierarchical, meaning they are composed of multiple layers, with each layer learning a certain pattern. The learning process can be either supervised, meaning that labeled data is used to train the model, or unsupervised, which means that no labeled data is given for the training process. Once trained, the model can make predictions about data it has not seen before. In this sense, prediction is not strictly limited to the definition of its term. It relates to a large number of operations like object detection, object/entity classification, multimedia generation, point cloud compression, and much more.\n\nUsing these neural networks to address problems in the 3D domain can be tricky, as it requires more computational power and attention than in the 2D domain. One important task is related to 3D editing and the human interpretability of geometric parameters.\n\nEasing the 3D editing or customization process can be important for gaming or computer graphics applications. People interested in gaming probably know the detail of the customization that some editors can provide while creating a personalized avatar in games, from sport to action. Have you ever wondered how much time it takes to set up all these characteristics on the developer\u2019s side? Defining all those characteristics can take weeks or, worst case, months.\n\nGood news comes from research work presented in this article which shines a light on this problem and proposes a solution to automatize this process.\n\nThe proposed framework is depicted in the figure below.\n\nThe objective is to recover an editable 3D mesh from an input item represented as a 3D point cloud or a 2D sketch picture. To do this, the authors create procedural software that enforces a set of form constraints and is parameterized by controls that are easy for humans to understand. After teaching a neural network to infer the program parameters, they can generate and recover an editable 3D shape by running the program. This application has straightforward controls in addition to structural data, leading to consistent semantic portion segmentation by building.\n\nSpecifically, the program supports three parameters: discrete, binary, and continuous. The disentanglement of the shape parameters guarantees accurate control over the object characteristics. For instance, we can isolate the seat\u2019s shape from the other parts of a chair. Hence, modifying the seat will not impact the geometry of the remaining parameters, such as the backrest or the legs.\n\nTo obtain editing flexibility, mesh primitives such as spheres or planes are created and modified according to the user\u2019s needs. Two curves guide the generation of the final shape: a one-dimensional curve describing a path in the 3D space, and a two-dimensional curve, representing the profile of the shape.\n\nDefining curves in this way enables a rich variety of combinations, specified not only by the curves themselves but also by the attachment points, which are the points at which two curves are connected to each other. These points can be defined by a scalar floating value from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the beginning, and 1 is the end of the curve.\n\nBefore feeding the parameters to the program for the final 3D shape recovery, an encoder-decoder network architecture is exploited to map a point cloud or sketch input to the parameter representation.\n\nThe encoder embeds the input into a global feature vector. Then, the vector embeddings are fed to a set of decoders, each with the scope of translating the input into a single parameter (disentanglement).\n\nGeoCode can be used for various editing tasks, such as interpolation between shapes. An example is shown in the figure below.\n\nThis was the summary of GeoCode, a novel AI framework to address the 3D shape synthesis problem. If you are interested, you can find more information in the links below.\n\nCheck out the Paper, Github, and Project. All Credit For This Research Goes To the Researchers on This Project.

Users need only purchase product bins and the frames that the robots run on.\n\nA Pio facility is modular and scalable and runs on standard plug-and-play software that connects to the most common online retail and shipping platforms.\n\nIn effect, Pio lets small and medium-sized business compete against much larger ones, with minimal capital expense, added labor, or need for additional floor space.\n\nMagne Hatteland, VP and head of Pio, says: \u201cNever before has the option for a fully automated storage and retrieval system been offered to the SMB segment \u2013 and certainly not with robotic technology that has been proven through multitudes of successful installations around the world for over 20 years.\n\n\u201cWith Pio, you can expand without having to move, enabling users to run their businesses closer to customers. We are already seeing success with Pio systems operating at several high-profile retailers in Europe.\n\n\u201cNow that the system is available in North America, we are ready to support fast-growing independent retailers here as well.\u201d\n\nShare this: Print\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nSkype\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPocket\n\n", "title": "AutoStore launches new robotic system for warehouses", "keywords": ["pio", "automation", "system", "worlds", "retailers", "storage", "launches", "users", "automated", "autostore", "technology", "warehouses", "robotic"], "link": "https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2023/01/16/autostore-launches-new-robotic-system-for-warehouses/59097/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n2/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 2}, "18": {"text": "Boosted by technology and patents, gamification has clearly gained momentum in the amusement and attractions space.\n\nAs technologies such as VR, AR, MR and autonomous motion evolve, interactive game elements are seeing continued investment across the attractions industry. Following is a recent update.\n\nDynamic Attractions and Dynamic Technologies Group recently announced the Dynamic Motion Theater, comprising live on-stage action and a 360-degree screen, with the audience seated on a circular platform. The attraction is scheduled to be opened at Futuroscope, in France, under the name of Tornado Chasers \u2014 receiving its grand opening in August.\n\nMeanwhile, Intamin announced its Dynamic Motion Stage \u2014 an immersive attraction ride system with four hydraulic cylinders with a central fixed support with multiple ride pods offering various seating configurations, offering capacity of up to 108 passengers and the ability to support media-based or physical props storytelling and 4D effects.\n\nThe system will be able to support dome and screen-based projection and has been promoted as a new level of an immersive ride experience. This marks one of a number of rides of interest from the market for this novel approach to media-based attractions.\n\nOther new developments revealed in this field included those from Cavu and Kuka, revealing the new autonomous ride attraction, using self-driving vehicle technology from Kuka able to achieve a dynamic motion profile through AI technology.\n\nPatents drive innovation\n\nThe deployment of gamification into the attraction sector gathers pace with new patents every day, showing the thinking of the attraction developers towards a gamified/interactive future. This was illustrated with the news of a filing of a U.S. patent by water attraction developer Whitewater West Industries.\n\nThe company proposed an \"Interactive Amusement Attraction and Method\" that offers the ability for riders on waterslides to take part in a game experience hitting embedded trackers on the flume or special triggers. Scores are accumulated and tracked on screens and smart apps.\n\nVortex Aquatic Structures International created the \"Dream Tunnel\" in partnership with Super Aqua Club to develop the media-based water experience. It is aimed at being deployed within attractions such as flumes and water rides, with a combination of laser imagery, waterfall display and audio to create an immersive experience played within the space.\n\nFalcon's Creative Group has introduced its 4D Dark Ride technology, representing the EVO-6 motion-base tracked ride system in partnership with Oceaneering. The company also revealed more of its plans for the Falcon's resort project, \"Falcon's Beyond,\" currently in the development stage following the announcement of the partnership with Katmandu Park.\n\nTriotech steps forward\n\nTriotech recreated its \"HyperRide\" attraction with a tracked ride-car moving between screens which the player shoots at.\n\nThe company also launched its \"Qube\" platform \u2014 an amusement-based enclosure that offers four motion seats for players with guns to shoot at the action on screen. This is best described as a scaled down variant of the popular \"Dark Ride Theater\" shooting experience, which should appeal to a wider operator base. The Qube systems will prove a popular FEC piece for venues still undecided on buying the full-size theater attraction. The company also introduced its interactive \"Storm,\" a two-player VR amusement piece called \"Creepy Castle.\"\n\nTriotech has also announced an attraction based on the popular IP, \"PUBG: Battlegrounds.\" Developed in partnership with Lotte World in South Korea, the 8,000-square-foot walk-through attraction will be called \"Battlegrounds World Agent\" and will include the popular elements from the \"Player Unknown Battle Ground\" shooting game split into three zones.\n\nDOF Robotics has introduced \"Digital Park: Mission Space,\" a multi-stage experience that lasts over 30 minutes, broken down into stages, with teams of six players. It also comprises motion simulation and themed experience led by cast members.\n\nThe attractions stages include the first being shot into space, interaction with the space station, and then the surface of the moon and interactive elements \u2014 along with the ride simulation. The attraction has been created to support from six to 30 guests at a time with six sessions per hour.\n\nThe concept incorporates endless theming (story) options, from space, underwater, time-travelling and even zombie adventures. The first installation of this attraction has been signed for launch at Camlica Tower in Istanbul, Turkey \u2014 opening in 2023.\n\nBold Move Nation introduced \"AR Quest\" with dinosaur-themed \"Raptor Expedition\" \u2014 an interactive walk-through that falls into the mixed reality category of innovation.\n\nThe company is also involved with other AR and VR solutions, with the \"WaterSlider VR\" experience, along with a \"phygital\" (the marriage of physical and digital interactivity) VR escape room platform, targeting parks as well as FEC deployment.\n\nGame Over Escape Rooms \u2014 an international franchise based in Greece \u2014 introduced a range of experiences, including the launch of \"Cube Challenges\" game. Specially developed skills, fitness and brain power are all individual challenges for teams from two-to-six players, with all players wearing tracked wristbands and gathering points counted through the Cube OS.\n\nFilms inspire innovation\n\nSimEx-Iwerks Entertainment has partnered with Red Raion \u2014 with a customized CGi film called \"Frostbite: Dino Island III\" \u2014 specially developed for the SimEx-Iwerks FlyRide theater system. Along with this, they announced three new experiential attractions. The first of these revealed was the 'Immersion Theater' \u2014 a scalable attraction comprising special effects and motion seat theater, running the corporation's selection of films as a turn-key attraction and allowing venue operators access to a simple media-theater installation. Initial renderings of the concept placed it in a zoological setting as an immersive experience for zoos, as well as smaller leisure parks.\n\nOther providers of extensive film and content libraries include nWave Studio, announcing the film \"Meg and The Lost Scepter\" from the latest feature film \"Chickenhare and The Hamster of Darkness.\"\n\nBoosted by new technology, gamification has clearly gained momentum in the amusement and attractions space.\n\n(Editor's note: Extracts from this blog are from recent coverage in The Stinger Report, published by Spider Entertainment and its director, Kevin Williams, the leading interactive out-of-home entertainment news service covering the immersive frontier and beyond.)", "title": "Innovations keep driving gamification for attractions", "keywords": ["theater", "experience", "vr", "gamification", "attraction", "attractions", "motion", "introduced", "immersive", "innovations", "driving", "ride", "interactive"], "link": "https://www.vendingtimes.com/blogs/innovations-keep-driving-gamification-for-attractions/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n3/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 3}, "19": {"text": "DesignFuture Japan, the Japanese arm of Material Bank, the world\u2019s largest marketplace for aggregating and sending out material samples, and Locus Robotics, the leader in Autonomous Mobile Robotics (AMR) for logistics and distribution warehouses, announced today that they will collaborate to deploy LocusBots at Material Bank Japan in their distribution warehouse.\n\n\u201cThe reason Material Bank in the United States has grown into a service used by 100,000 designers in just three years is none other than the fact that it greatly contributed to streamlining operations related to sample requests,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Nakazawa, CEO of DesignFuture Japan. \u201cSurvey results show that designers in the United States spend nearly 40% of their time requesting samples, but in interviews with Japanese designers, we hear that they spend more time than that.
