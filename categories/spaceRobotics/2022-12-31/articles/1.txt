MDA Ltd. (TSE:MDA) surges 12%; individual investors who own 41% shares profited along with institutions - Simply Wall St News
Stock Analysis  A look at the shareholders of MDA Ltd. (TSE:MDA) can tell us which group is most powerful.  With 41% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company.  Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).   Following a 12% increase in the stock price last week, individual investors profited the most, but institutions who own 27% stock also stood to gain from the increase.       Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MDA, beginning with the chart below.   Check out our latest analysis for MDA   Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.   As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in MDA.  This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see MDA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.   Our data indicates that hedge funds own 11% of MDA.   That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher.      John Risley is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding.        With 11% and 9.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Senvest Management, LLC and EdgePoint Investment Group Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.     We did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.    While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.   Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.    The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.   I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.   Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of MDA Ltd..   It has a market capitalization of just CA$729m, and insiders have CA$140m worth of shares in their own names.  It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently.    With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MDA.  While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.    While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.   I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.
