    "Front page layout Site theme \nJohn Timmer\n    -  Dec 31, 2022 11:06 am UTC\n How often does something work exactly as planned, and live up to its hype? In most of the world, that's the equivalent of stumbling across a unicorn that's holding a few winning lottery tickets in its teeth. But that pretty much describes our top science story of 2022, the successful deployment and initial images from the Webb Telescope. In fact, there was lots of good news to come out of the world of science, with a steady flow of fascinating discoveries and tantalizing potential tech\u2014over 200 individual articles drew in 100,000 readers or more, and the topics they covered came from all areas of science. Of course, with a pandemic and climate change happening, not everything we wrote was good news. But as the top stories of the year indicate, our readers found interest in a remarkable range of topics. For better and worse, Anthony Fauci has become the public face of the pandemic response in the US. He's trusted by some for his personable, plain-spoken advice regarding how to manage the risks of infection\u2014and vilified by others for his advocacy of vaccinations (plus a handful of conspiracy theories). So, when Fauci himself ended up on the wrong end of risk management and got a SARS-CoV-2 infection, that was news as well, and our pandemic specialist, Beth Mole, was there for it. It turned out the trajectory of his infection was a metaphor for the pandemic itself, where every silver lining seems to be delivered with a few additional gray clouds. Fauci took Paxlovid, a drug that was developed due to some very rapid scientific work that involved finding out the structure of viral proteins and then identifying molecules that could fit into that structure. As a result of its design, Paxlovid rapidly and effectively suppresses the SARS-CoV-2 infections that cause COVID-19. But once again, there are those gray clouds: once the treatment course runs out, many people experience a rebound of symptoms for reasons we're still working out. And Fauci was no exception, having symptoms severe enough that he went back on the drug to shut them down again\u2014even though that's not been recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. Neutron stars are probably the most extreme objects in the Universe (black holes being more of an aberration in spacetime than an object, per se). They're places where the tallest \"mountains\" are less than a millimeter, and cracks in the crust can create violent bursts of radiation. They're also places where the interior is a superfluid of rapidly circulating subatomic particles. But in a handful of these stars, conditions get even more extreme, as any charged particles in the superfluidic interior can create a dynamo like the one in the Earth's core that creates our magnetic field. Except just a bit stronger. Well, as Paul Sutter details it, 1016 times stronger. These are the magnetars, a short-lived state of some neutron stars (they last about 10,000 years, which is short for astronomy). There are plenty of ways a neutron star can kill you, given its intense gravity and tendency to spew out lethal levels of radiation. But magnetars have an additional trick: they end chemistry. The magnetic fields are so strong that they can distort the atomic orbitals that determine how different atoms latch on to each other to form chemical bonds. Get within 1,000 kilometers or so of a magnetar, and that distortion gets so severe that the chemical bonds no longer function. All your atoms are left free to wander around as they see fit, which isn't generally conducive to life. This article was a personal rumination by Eric Berger, reflecting on the changes in NASA and the launch industry since he started covering both roughly two decades ago. For most of that time, NASA's budget has been dominated by the Space Launch System, which finally took its maiden flight this year, sending hardware to orbit the Moon and return for a flawless splashdown. In the wake of that launch, you might expect that the piece would focus on that success. Instead, Berger argued that the many failures of the program\u2014countless delays and cost overruns\u2014changed the entire launch industry, giving small companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin a chance to thrive while their entrenched competitors were focused on getting all they could out of SLS contracts. Without SLS's problems, Berger argues, the vehicles that will eventually see NASA to a successful future of crewed exploration might never have been built.

    "Stock Analysis  A look at the shareholders of MDA Ltd. (TSE:MDA) can tell us which group is most powerful.  With 41% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company.  Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).   Following a 12% increase in the stock price last week, individual investors profited the most, but institutions who own 27% stock also stood to gain from the increase.       Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MDA, beginning with the chart below.   Check out our latest analysis for MDA   Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.   As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in MDA.  This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see MDA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.   Our data indicates that hedge funds own 11% of MDA.   That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher.      John Risley is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding.        With 11% and 9.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Senvest Management, LLC and EdgePoint Investment Group Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.     We did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.    While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.   Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.    The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.   I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.   Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of MDA Ltd..   It has a market capitalization of just CA$729m, and insiders have CA$140m worth of shares in their own names.  It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently.    With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MDA.  While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.    While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.   I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.   But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.  NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.

Although space exploration has been going on for more than half a century, the extraterrestrial bodies on which humans have set foot are limited to the moon, which is the closest to the earth. Moreover, only the United States of America has achieved manned moon landings and there is still a long way to go for human space exploration. At the same time, space exploration activity by the People\u2019s Republic of China has gradually expanded in recent years. Moon sampling, the Tianwen-1 space mission to the red planet, the Martian rover Zhurong and the Tiangong (Celestial Palace), a Chinese modular space station under construction, part of the fourth permanent space station programme in history (after the Saljut, Skylab, Mir and the International Space Station), all are important symbols of China\u2019s turning into a space power. However, with the progress of the Chinese space industry, NASA \u2013 which is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean \u2013 is also feeling much pressure, with its desire to initiate a plan to go back to the moon and maintain its leading position in space technology thanks to the Artemis project. Faced with pressure from Chinese moon landings and space station research, NASA has announced that it will go back to the moon in 2024. This time, with the return to the moon, the United States of America has set two main goals for itself: a new manned lunar landing; and the return to the moon to look for ways to enable humans to live permanently on the surface of our satellite and exploit it scientifically and for mining. The Artemis project aims to establish a moonbase in the meteorite crater near the satellite south pole, named after the explorer Ernest Henry Shackleton (1874-1922). This is the first task. Once the moonbase is successfully established, NASA will be able to obtain in advance the technology for the future construction of the base on Mars. Is mineral extraction part of the programme? NASA plans to build a moonbase. The peaks on the rim of Shackleton Crater are continuously exposed to sunlight, but the interior is permanently shaded. Scientists also call it the crater of eternal night. The permanent shadow inside leads to a low temperature, which has captured and frozen volatile components emitted by celestial bodies when they hit the moon. The Lunar Prospector, launched on 7 January 1998 by NASA, found a higher than normal amount of hydrogen gas in the craters during its measurement mission to the moon, indicating the presence of water ice. The Lunar Prospector, was designed for a short polar orbit analysing our satellite, mapping the surface and any polar ice deposits, measuring the magnetic field and gravity, and studying lunar events. Once the water ice extraction technology is achieved, the construction of both the moonbase and the Mars base can be greatly improved. The water ice can break down into hydrogen and oxygen, the main components of rocket fuel. In the future, the moonbase could also serve as a space service station. With a view to developing moon mining technology, NASA has also launched a competition called Break the Ice Lunar Challenge. Well-known technology companies such as Masten Space Systems, Lunar Outpost and Honeybee Robotics have currently joined the challenge. They plan to use rocket engines to design a moon mining vehicle weighing over 800 kilograms. When the moon mining vehicle reaches a site containing water ice, its engine enclosed in the dome will start up, launching the water ice-laden debris into a vacuum device that separates and stores the water ice particles. According to the plan, this moon mining vehicle is capable of mining operations from twelve craters per day. Each crater can produce about 100 kilograms of ice and more than 420,000 kilograms of lunar water ice can be recovered each year. Besides lunar water ice, the Artemis programme also includes research into the extraction of helium-3. Helium-3 (He-3) is a very valuable resource in space, and its presence on earth is rather limited. It is formed by the decay of tritium (hydrogen-3, the third isotope of the element hydrogen, after protium and deuterium). In the soil of the moon surface, there is one million tonnes of helium-3. Helium-3 can continuously supply energy to the moonbase. If the fusion energy of helium-3 is used, just 200,000 tonnes of helium-3 can enable a population of nearly one and a half billion people to use electricity for an entire year. It is also very likely that this type of space minerals will change the energy process of rockets and cause a qualitative transformation of human space technology. NASA has quickly embarked on the project to return to the moon, mainly because the satellite soil collected by the Chinese probes on the moon contains this type of future energy. NASA must also complete the technology to withstand space radiation for the Artemis project. The surface of the moon, like the surface of Mars, is not protected by an ozone layer. This is precisely the reason why space radiation there is very high. Studies have shown that space radiation can easily penetrate the bulkheads of manned spacecraft and pass through crew members\u2019 bodies. Space radiation can damage the DNA of crew members, causing a number of irreparable consequences. With a view to solving the threat of space radiation, NASA approached the research institutes of the University of Washington and Harvard University to ask for collaboration and participation in studies. In the high-tech competition, they found a very powerful small molecule. It plays an important role in repairing DNA damaged by space radiation and in restoring muscle and skeletal loss in weightlessness. This molecule is involved in the synthesis of cofactors in human cells and is a substance found in the human body and in nature. People can restore or increase the level of cellular cofactors in the body by supplementing the molecule, which is able to restore declining mitochondria and repair damaged DNA. Likewise, astronauts can also repair damaged DNA by supplementing the molecule after having been exposed to space radiation. NASA has collected a large amount of data on the radiation exposure of astronauts during space activities over the past decades. Based on this data, the Ames Research Center \u2013 one of NASA\u2019s ten largest centres, located in California\u2019s Silicon Valley at Moffett Field Airport \u2013 has developed a roadmap for radiation resistance in the human body. In the roadmap, NASA plans to use modern gene editing technology to modify astronauts\u2019 DNA so that they can adapt to the high-radiation space environment. Judging by the current level of technology, however, when we return to the moon in 2024, it is estimated that gene editing technology will not yet have reached the point where it can affect astronauts\u2019 DNA. NASA can rely on the aforementioned molecule, which will be safe and reliable only after marketing. A few years ago, some biological companies focused on studying molecules against ageing and on restoring levels to cope with mitochondrial diseases. Scientific tests and marketing have demonstrated the molecule safety, and NASA wants to use this material to complete the relevant tests on the moonbase before it can be used in large-scale space activities. The moon is the closest celestial body to the earth, and is a unique outpost for humans to improve space technology. Although it looks desolate, it contains a lot of energy that the earth does not have. Humans can probably improve aerospace technology on the moon to a higher level than on earth. It must be said, however, that if we are serious about mining or other activities on the moon, concluding relevant binding treaties is essential, and all countries carrying out space activities must be able to comply with them. In this way, the moon is protected and severe consequences are avoided for what will happen \u201cin the sky\u201d if there is conflict on earth. Psychedelic drugs, monkey brains and rescue drones to feature in cutting-edge research Advisory Board Co-chair Honoris Causa\n\nProfessor Giancarlo Elia Valori is an eminent Italian economist and businessman. He holds prestigious academic distinctions and national orders. Mr. Valori has lectured on international affairs and economics at the world\u2019s leading universities such as Peking University, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Yeshiva University in New York. \n\nHe currently chairs \u201cInternational World Group\u201d, he is also the honorary president of Huawei Italy, economic adviser to the Chinese giant HNA Group.\n\nIn 1992 he was appointed Officier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur de la R\u00e9publique Francaise, with this motivation: \u201cA man who can see across borders to understand the world\u201d and in 2002 he received the title \u201cHonorable\u201d of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de l\u2019Institut de France. \u201c Post-Cold war threats Psychedelic drugs, monkey brains and rescue drones to feature in cutting-edge research Are the Geopolitics of the Middle East changing? What\u2019s Ahead For Major Problems Like Ukraine? The Real-Life Spy Novel to Take Out Trump and Putin Sociologist sees Germany on its way to becoming a \u201cbeneficial state\u201d Published on By By Vittoria D\u2019alessio From more fresh water and less depression to life-saving drones and thought-interpreting scans, 2023 promises to be a big year in science. Still, don\u2019t expect to fly in a plane powered by electricity anytime soon. Dr Pascal Belin, a neuroscientist at the Aix-Marseille University in France and primary investigator in the EU-funded COVOPRIM project, studies humans and monkeys to understand better what happens in the brains of primates when they communicate. Scans show a remarkable similarity in the way human, marmoset and macaque brains light up when a voice is heard from another member of their species. Next year, researchers plan to implant electrodes in monkey brains to investigate this phenomenon at a nerve-cell level. The implications are far-reaching, both for people who lose the ability to speak following a brain injury or stroke and for general human interaction with technology.  \u2018Soon, we\u2019ll be able to interpret the activity of neurons in different regions of the brain very clearly. We\u2019re already understanding better and better which region does what. Soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to decode what someone is listening to simply by observing brain activity. We\u2019ll also be able to elucidate what people are imagining without their thoughts being vocalised. It\u2019s not quite the same as reading someone\u2019s thoughts \u2013 it\u2019s more about reconstructing what\u2019s going on in the brain by interpreting the activity of neurons.  \u2018In time, our new knowledge will also be used to control machines. More and more progress is already being made in this area. There will be neural implants, the kind already fitted in some epileptic patients when they don\u2019t respond to treatment, that can be strategically placed in the brain to enhance a person\u2019s perception \u2013 much like a cochlear implant is used today in thousands of deaf people so they can hear \u2013 or to send impulses that command a computer. \u2018It will mean people can express themselves without using a keyboard. A keyboard and pen are awkward crutches that have been necessary in our path towards technological innovation to allow us to convert verbal information in our brain into written words, but they won\u2019t be necessary once your computer can read that information directly from your brain. Though I\u2019m not a specialist in brain-computer interfaces, I believe this sort of innovation will be available in five to 10 years, not 40.\u2019 Tomorrow\u2019s cities will improve the safety of residents and structures alike, according to Professor Gian Paolo Cimellaro, an engineer at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy. Prof Cimellaro led the EU-funded IDEAL DRONE project to develop drones that can be deployed by firefighters to help locate people trapped in burning buildings. He believes techniques to monitor structures and rescue civilians will improve immensely in the coming years. \u2018We\u2019ll see huge change in the field of disaster resilience \u2013 both in the short- and medium-term. The advanced technologies we\u2019ve been working on mean people can be tracked inside buildings and soon we\u2019ll be able to do even better. For instance, rescue teams will wear exoskeletons \u2013 rugged suits that synchronise with their movement and give them protection and strength \u2013 so they can move heavy debris to get to survivors. \u2018Climate change will put more pressure on infrastructures, meaning disasters will happen more frequently, so we\u2019ll need to build greater resilience into all civilian infrastructure. Whenever there\u2019s a disaster, such as a partial bridge collapse, functionality drops and there\u2019s a recovery process. We\u2019ll be minimising the downtime. To stick with the bridge example, the only way to know if a bridge is safe today is through visual inspection: the engineer looks at the deck and decides whether or not to replace a part. But soon, sensors will become cheaper and bridges will be covered in them. These will report back on levels of ageing. That way, when a problem is detected, it can be fixed before it becomes a crisis. \u2018Eventually, we\u2019ll have \u2018\u2018super artificial intelligence\u2019\u2019, where a machine is smarter than the engineer and can inspect a structure and perform actions better than any human. For very long bridges, inspection will be done by drones equipped with robots that will collect multiple sets of information at the same time using high-resolution cameras, thermal cameras and laser scanners.\u2019 Psychedelic drugs, when paired with specialist psychotherapy, show great promise as treatments for chronic, tricky mental illnesses. Scientists in Europe and the US including Dr Claudia Schwarz-Plaschg are unravelling the neuroscience of psychedelic \u2018trips\u2019, hoping to bring an end to debilitating conditions like depression and trauma. Dr Schwarz-Plaschg completed the EU-funded ReMedPsy project in which she examined society\u2019s evolving views on these substances. \u2018I envisage research into the benefits of psychedelics moving beyond mental-health issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction to include any condition where mind and body are integrated \u2013 from autism and dementia to obesity and pain disorders. I also anticipate more research into how psychedelics can enhance creativity and help with problem solving, as these substances are known to foster shifts in perspective. \u2018In terms of risks, we also need more studies into the adverse effects of psychedelics. Bad trips happen and can be very destabilising. I expect we\u2019ll see the broader conversation on drug decriminalisation and legalisation move forward in the next few years, and this will include psychedelics. \u2018I also anticipate more research into the spiritual and religious benefits of these substances. We\u2019re undergoing a spiritual crisis in western society. Psychedelics could play a role in helping people find deeper meaning in life again. I hope 2023 will enable me and other critical scholars to scrutinise how knowledge is created in this field. What impact does psychedelic research have on communities that have been using psychedelics for much longer than Western science? Are we extracting knowledge from Indigenous and underground communities without giving back?\u2019 Because air travel contributes to global warming, European researchers are exploring the potential of electric and hybrid engines to reduce jets\u2019 carbon footprint. With today\u2019s batteries still some way from being ready for commercial use, Fabio Russo, head of research at Italian aircraft maker Tecnam and coordinator of the EU-funded H3PS project, says real progress requires airlines to make tangible commitments. \u2018Our company is putting resources and engineering into developing new technologies for both all-electric and hybrid aircraft. However, all-electric batteries work only in light aircraft with a flying time of around 20 or 30 minutes plus reserve, so clearly that\u2019s unlikely to work for people wanting to fly even short-haul in commercial airliners. \u2018Why are things not moving as fast as we\u2019d like? Because, even though we see lots of press releases from airlines expressing their intention to be on a sustainable path, only rarely something tangible then happens. There is no progressive business model, no meaningful commitments when it comes to making pledges about purchases of cleaner aircraft. This does not help manufacturers to safely unlock huge investments. And this needs to change or else engineers, manufacturers and airlines will jeopardise their credibility. \u2018Currently, a battery can no longer be used in aircraft once its performance drops below 90% because, at this point, the flight range becomes severely compromised and there\u2019s an increased risk of the battery overheating. This means that after around 800 flight cycles \u2013 typically a few weeks of flying \u2013 the battery needs to be removed and a new one bought for likely many thousands of euros. And that\u2019s just for a nine-passenger aircraft with very low range. This is too costly to make business sense, plus it\u2019s environmentally wasteful. Over the next few years, I hope we find ways to make batteries last longer and allow them to be \u201coverhauled\u201d, meaning the airline would give its battery back to the manufacturer and get another with new cells. The old battery would then be sold to power other machines like consumer electronics or those used for energy storage.\u2019 Fresh-water supplies are diminishing around the world. As populations grow and droughts worsen, scientists are seeking new ways to convert high-saline water (as exists in oceans) into a form that can be piped into homes and industry. George Brik is chief executive officer of Hydro Volta, a Belgium-based company with a patented desalination technology. Developed in the EU-funded SonixED project, the technology is a lot greener than anything used today, requiring far less energy and fewer chemicals. \u2018The world has an unlimited supply of seawater but it\u2019s wasteful, expensive and harsh on the environment to desalinate water using traditional techniques. This is where Hydro Volta can help. Our technology makes the conversion of seawater to fresh water both cheaper and safer for the environment. All that\u2019s left is for us to scale up our processes and get the message across to governments and industry that we can help them solve an important and growing problem. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll get this opportunity over the next few years. \u2018I came to Belgium with my family as a survivor of the Syrian war 10 years ago. I was already working in the water-treatment industry in Syria, but I had to leave everything behind and start from scratch when I moved to Belgium, which was very difficult. \u2018But two years after arriving, I met a man named Yousef Yousef who became my business partner and co-founder and, from the start, the Flemish government and the EU have believed in our project and supported us. I\u2019m so thankful for the opportunity I have been given. Now all that\u2019s left is for us to be get the chance to take our technology out into the world.\u2019 This article was originally published\u202fin Horizon, the EU Research and Innovation Magazine.    Published on By Since the Covid19 outbreak and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, many industrialised and developing nations have understood the significance of supply chains and the risks they provide. This has been seen in the situations of numerous items, such as food and oil, whose supply was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war; it is now especially evident in the case of semiconductors. Every nation, whether developed or developing, requires semiconductors since they are utilised in every electronic device and in a range of areas, including medical, healthcare, defence, renewable energy initiatives, and a number of upcoming projects, such as quantum computing. The leaders in the semiconductors race on the worldwide market are the United States, whose 2020 market share was valued at over $200 billion. The United States has been a pioneer in the export of semiconductors, commanding about 50 percent of the worldwide market. Semiconductors are one of the top export goods of the United States. Additionally, the United States invests more than one-fifth of their sales on research and development, placing them second only to the pharmaceutical business. China is another nation that is emerging as a major participant in the semiconductor race, since it has been making rapid progress in this arena. China\u2019s semiconductor industry has been growing since 2015, when it accounted for only 3.8% of the global supply race. However, in the last 5 years, China\u2019s semiconductor industry has grown from a mere $!3billion in 2015 to an annual growth rate of $40 billion market industry, and China now stands 1% behind Europe and Japan in the semiconductor race, as China\u2019s semiconductor industry accounts for 9% today and the Europe\u2019s and Japan\u2019s annual percentage growth rates are 2% and 3%, respectively. China has already eclipsed Taiwan in the semiconductor business during the previous two years. If China\u2019s semiconductor industry continues to develop at the same rate, its annual sales might reach $114 billion by 2024, placing it just behind the United States and South Korea. India\u2019s future with Semiconductors India\u2019s current semiconductor facilities are the Gallium Arsenide Enabling Technology Centre (GAETEC) and the Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL), but all this could change as India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed at the Indian Mobile Congress, which helped in highlighting India\u2019s scope and ambitions with the future technology which India t is developing. The government has begun to recognise the importance of semiconductors and how a domestic semiconductor industry could enable India to reduce its dependence on the giants of the Semiconductor industry and increase the \u2018Atmanhirbar Plan\u2019 of India. The Prime Minister of India aspires to make India a leader in cutting-edge technology, and semiconductors are a key component in achieving this objective. The United States has long sought to isolate its essential technology supply chains from China; India can provide an assist in this endeavour. In this cooperation, India is projected to contribute a total of $20 billion, which may help India become a superpower and compete with nations like China and European markets in the chip race. Many countries, not just the United States, are adopting a \u201cChina Plus One\u201d strategy to reduce their reliance on China and shift their markets to \u201clike-minded countries\u201d such as India. Many private companies, such as Tata and Adana, have also pledged multi-million dollar investments in this project, which can help India\u2019s semiconductor industry grow at a projected rate of $64 billion by 2026, representing a 19% annual growth rate. As India has been relatively weak in this sector, as India\u2019s imports of semiconductors inputs reached $21 billion in 2019 and that figure has been rising rapidly each year, the recent semiconductor manufacturing incentives offered by the government of India will also help the Indian economy as many American companies will expand their capacities in India and this will help in building the right supply chains worldwide and this will also help industries in India. This will also contribute to the growth of the Indian economy. Conclusion While all of this is true and will help India in the long run and increase its presence on the global market, India must not forget that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. India must also keep in mind that chip manufacturing requires a great deal of raw materials and that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. The India-United States cooperation cannot be viewed as restrictive to any particular field, and with the rapidly changing geopolitical situation, it is important to remember that China, which is a producer of electronics, is also a consumer, and that one must observe how the semiconductor and high-end chip industries continue and how demand develops. Published on By In December 2022, the International Center for Social and Political Studies and Consulting published the second report \u201cExperts on the Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to International Psychological Security\u201d, penned by this author. This report stems from the research project titled \u201cMalicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to Psychological Security in Northeast Asia\u201d (21-514-92001) and jointly funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) and the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences (VASS). The responses garnered from a targeted survey of twenty-five experts from twelve countries and the subsequent analysis of their feedback aim to bring to light the most serious threats to international information-psychological security (IPS) through malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI), determining how dangerous these threats are, which measures should be used to neutralize them, and identifying the prospects for international cooperation in this area. This publication attempts to define the current level of MUAI threat to the IPS as well as its possible level by 2030. The report pays special attention to the situation in Northeast Asia (NEA), where MUAI practices are based on a combination of a high level of AI technologies in leading countries and a complex of acute contradictions in the region. The results of the second survey allow us to trace the continuity and changes in expert assessments compared to the first survey conducted a year earlier, in which nineteen experts from ten countries took part. In the year since the first expert survey, the world has become even more unstable and dangerous. NATO\u2019s aggressive advance to the East provoked a massive military conflict in Ukraine, one that risks escalating into a world war. Gross domestic product in Ukraine is expected to decline 35 to 40 percent in 2022; Russia also expects a decline of 2,5 percent for the same period. There are clear signs of a recession in the U.S. and the EU, with this economic slowdown reaching even China. Unprecedented inflation, rising borrowing costs, and increasingly intimidating levels of indebtedness are all contributing to fears of economic collapse in many Western and non-Western countries. However, even amid COVID-19, the ultra-rich have little to worry about. In 2022, Forbes identified more than 1,000 billionaires around the world who were richer than they were a year prior (Dolan and Peterson-Withorn, 2022). This deepening polarization in living standards inevitably intensifies the world\u2019s most acute political, racial, and national conflicts across both developing and rich countries\u2014including the United States, long thought immune to such turmoil. In a sick society, threats to psychological security through the malicious use of AI are much higher than in a socially healthy environment. Especially if social regression is observed against the background of the ongoing progress of high technologies. The transition to advanced forms of AI is already happening. In 2022, DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet specializing in AI, announced the creation of an intelligent agent called \u201cGato\u201d that can single-handedly perform more than 600 of different tasks (MSN, 2022). The same network, with the same weights, can play Atari video games, capture images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more. Gato decides whether to produce text, torque joints, press buttons or take other actions based on context (DeepMind, 2022). The agent could outperform human experts in 450 tasks. Gato learns several different tasks at the same time, easily switching from one skill to another without forgetting what it has learned. Previous AI models have started to combine different skills but when starting a new task, these models had to forget what was previously learned in order to move on to the next one. However, Gato does make some mistakes that a human would not make. While Gato is still far from being an AGI creation, progress is still evident. In terms of malicious use, an agent similar to Gato repeatedly, if not by orders of magnitude, reduces the cost of preparing and implementing various actions by one agent. This makes it easier to carry out psychological operations with a combined effect on the senses\u2014an intelligent agent like Gato can simultaneously send text messages, conduct a conversation and so on. Modern AI capabilities already enable one to influence public consciousness. The president-elect of South Korea, Yoon Suk-yeol, used an unusual strategy during his 2022 election campaign. His campaign team used deepfakes to make an \u201cAI avatar\u201d that helped him win the election. This technology is helpful for appealing to younger voters and to get them more involved (Vastmindz 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s creators believe he is the world\u2019s first official deepfake candidate\u2014a concept that is gaining traction in South Korea, which has the world\u2019s fastest average internet speeds (AFP 2022). AI technology transformed Yoon Suk-yeol into a more modern candidate than his competitors from the perspective of younger voters. With neatly combed, black hair and a smart suit, the avatar looks nearly identical to the real candidate but instead, used salty language and meme-ready quips in a bid to engage younger voters who get their news online (AFPRelaxnews 2022). Some alarms were raised when the avatar politician used humor to try and deflect attention from Yoon\u2019s past scandals (The Times of India 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s pronouncements made headlines in the South Korean media, and seven million people visited the \u201cWiki Yoon\u201d website to question the avatar (AFP 2022). At first glance, AI Yoon could pass for an actual candidate\u2014an apt demonstration of how far artificially generated videos have come in the last few years. \u201cWords that are often spoken by Yoon are better reflected in AI Yoon,\u201d said Baik Kyeong-hoon, director of the AI Yoon team (AFP 2022). However, there is a question about what should be done if the avatar of a statesman, politician or business person is a false representation, reinforcing in the public\u2019s conscious and subconscious mind inflated qualities, creating the illusion of attributes that the real person does not possess. The experience of South Korea\u2019s last presidential campaign may have shown, in part, the initial form of a new method of rather dangerous political manipulation. An increasingly adaptive avatar that does not need rest creates an image that a real person will be able to compete with less and less in the public space. This prompts the question of whether \u201ctelevised presidents\u201d will soon be replaced by \u201cdeepfake presidents\u201d? The world\u2019s first AI TV news anchor was unveiled in China in 2018 (Kuo, 2018), and they were immediately noticeable as the result of an algorithm. However, in December 2021, AI company Xiaoice introduced N Xiaohei and N Xiaobai\u2014virtual replicas of two real-life news anchors\u2014on \u201cAI Business Daily.\u201d According to the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, Xiaoice, in collaboration with National Business Daily, has demonstrated a strong ability to develop virtual replicas that are effectively indistinguishable from real humans through advanced machine learning (ML) and rendering technologies (Lin, 2022). Unfortunately, these extraordinary achievements have the potential to be used for malicious purposes by anti-social actors aiming to destabilize the public consciousness, provoke anti-social actions, and/or deceive individuals. Notably, this risk is not purely theoretical, with deepfakes having been used on several occasions to trick companies into sending money by them (Statt, 2019; Stupp, 2019; Veldkamp, 2022). Of course, this practice is not yet common, meaning that the risk is fairly minor\u2014for now. In June 2022, the FBI warned that scammers are beginning to use deepfakes to apple for sensitive jobs; this type of fraud could be used to gain access to company networks and obtain company data (Ferraro and Chipman, 2022). AI technologies are being tested in military conflicts, including psychological warfare. The use of Western-produced AI technologies in the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is significant. US facial recognition startup Clearview AI has provided technical support to Ukraine. Clearview AI\u2019s tools can identify faces in videos, comparing them to a company database of 20 billion images from public networks, identifying potential spies and people who have been killed. AI tools also play an important role in Ukraine\u2019s propaganda war and in processing critical conflict information. A program from the US company Primer can perform speech recognition, transcription and translation that captures and analyzes Russian information, including conversations between Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The Swiss encrypted chat service called Threema allows Ukrainian users to send this data to the military without revealing their identities. According to former Google chief executive officer Eric Schmidt, now an AI adviser to the US government, the Ukrainian military receives thousands of such reports every day, which are then filtered by an AI program (Global Times, 2022). Russia has not been slow to respond. The Russian Federation\u2019s Ministry of Defense Office for the Development of Artificial Intelligence conducted an examination of the innovative projects to be presented at the Army 2022 Forum for AI technology use (IMTF \u201cArmy\u20132022,\u201d 2022). Vasily Elistratov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s Department for the Development of AI Technologies, said that special military operation experience in Ukraine is used to improve weapons systems (Ixbt.com, 2022). Unfortunately, the arms race that is growing in terms of both size and participation, not least in the field of AI, is making international security, including its psychological component, less and less durable. The potential for MUAI today is astounding. Noting this, researchers from Collaborations Pharmaceuticals in cooperation with European scientific institutions conducted a conceptual experiment. Instead of synthesizing new drugs, they asked the opposite of the MegaSyn AI neural network: to identify substances that are the most toxic to the human body. The neural network correctly understood the task and, in under six hours, generated a list of 40,000 substances that are optimal components of chemical and biological weapons. The AI independently designed not only many known chemical warfare agents, but also many new ones that are more toxic. This simple inversion of the ML model turned a harmless generative model from a useful tool into an enabler of mass murder (Urbina et al., 2022). It is reasonable to suspect that this inversion approach could be applied to other areas, such as finding optimal ways to have negative psychological impacts on the public consciousness. The most worrisome aspect of these mounting concerns is simple: legislative responses are lagging behind. The sluggish speed of the legislative process (especially relative to that of the MUAI-development process) is clear in the fact that, for example, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, at the time of writing this text, has not yet passed the first reading in the European Parliament (EUR-Lex, 2022). In analyzing the current international situation, most studies focus on economic, military, and geopolitical changes without sufficiently linking them to the growing impact of qualitative technological changes on international dynamics, including those in the sphere of psychological security. This underestimation is clear in the near-complete lack in the literature of a systemic analysis of the possible risks of MUAI to psychological security at individual, group, national, and international levels. The absence of such an analysis is unacceptable for numerous reasons. First, the penetration of modern AI into countless spheres of life makes it a critical component of continued development and progress. Investment in AI may consist of trillions of dollars within the next two decades. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers Middle East (PwC) report released at the World Government Summit in Dubai, 14 per cent (U.S. $15.7 trillion) of global economic growth will stem from the use of AI by 2030. PwC believes that the greatest gains in 2030 will be in China, where AI will be responsible for up to 26 percent of economic growth (Rao and Verweij, 2018, p. 3). However, as already established, alongside AI\u2019s development will come tremendous risks, including in the field of psychological security. Second, there is already some research into international practices of MUAI in the psychological field. It is short-sighted not to continue existing research on a systemic interdisciplinary basis, taking into account the counter progress of AI technologies and the regression of existing public structures, national and international institutions, and simply wait until the consequences of AI become an even greater threat to international security. At the same time, strong support from state and non-state actors is required for such research that goes beyond such areas as cybersecurity and information security, as well as psychological security before the introduction of AI technologies, because we are talking about qualitatively different possibilities of causing irreparable damage to the development of human civilization than simply quantitative expansion of propaganda capabilities. Third, the international situation is continually worsening in several respects. This is not because of particular politicians being in power but because of the severity of the problems faced during the transition to a qualitatively new stage in human development. This transition has been accompanied by an increase in economic problems, socio-political tensions, and geopolitical competition. AI can become both the technological foundation of a new, more socially oriented world order, and the tool of high-tech undemocratic dictatorships, actively used for antisocial purposes by various non-state actors. The conducted expert survey and the subsequent analysis of its results are precisely intended to fill the gap in the awareness of the nature and scope of threats to society associated with modern and future MUAI practices in the context of the global crisis, as well as an assessment of possible risks in this area in the near future. Further research in this direction obviously follows from the nature and dynamics of the changes taking place in the world.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to build a moonbase. What makes it so anxious about such a new goal?\nCompared to the vast universe, human beings are undoubtedly less than grains of sand. Although space exploration has been going on for more than half a century, the extraterrestrial bodies on which humans have set foot are limited to the moon, which is the closest to the earth. Moreover, only the United States of America has achieved manned moon landings and there is still a long way to go for human space exploration.\nAt the same time, space exploration activity by the People\u2019s Republic of China has gradually expanded in recent years. Moon sampling, the Tianwen-1 space mission to the red planet, the Martian rover Zhurong and the Tiangong (Celestial Palace), a Chinese modular space station under construction, part of the fourth permanent space station programme in history (after the Saljut, Skylab, Mir and the International Space Station), all are important symbols of China\u2019s turning into a space power.\nHowever, with the progress of the Chinese space industry, NASA \u2013 which is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean \u2013 is also feeling much pressure, with its desire to initiate a plan to go back to the moon and maintain its leading position in space technology thanks to the Artemis project.\nFaced with pressure from Chinese moon landings and space station research, NASA has announced that it will go back to the moon in 2024. This time, with the return to the moon, the United States of America has set two main goals for itself: a new manned lunar landing; and the return to the moon to look for ways to enable humans to live permanently on the surface of our satellite and exploit it scientifically and for mining.\nThe Artemis project aims to establish a moonbase in the meteorite crater near the satellite south pole, named after the explorer Ernest Henry Shackleton (1874-1922). This is the first task. Once the moonbase is successfully established, NASA will be able to obtain in advance the technology for the future construction of the base on Mars.\nIs mineral extraction part of the programme? NASA plans to build a moonbase. The peaks on the rim of Shackleton Crater are continuously exposed to sunlight, but the interior is permanently shaded. Scientists also call it the crater of eternal night. The permanent shadow inside leads to a low temperature, which has captured and frozen volatile components emitted by celestial bodies when they hit the moon. The Lunar Prospector, launched on 7 January 1998 by NASA, found a higher than normal amount of hydrogen gas in the craters during its measurement mission to the moon, indicating the presence of water ice. The Lunar Prospector, was designed for a short polar orbit analysing our satellite, mapping the surface and any polar ice deposits, measuring the magnetic field and gravity, and studying lunar events.\nOnce the water ice extraction technology is achieved, the construction of both the moonbase and the Mars base can be greatly improved. The water ice can break down into hydrogen and oxygen, the main components of rocket fuel. In the future, the moonbase could also serve as a space service station.\nWith a view to developing moon mining technology, NASA has also launched a competition called Break the Ice Lunar Challenge. Well-known technology companies such as Masten Space Systems, Lunar Outpost and Honeybee Robotics have currently joined the challenge.\nThey plan to use rocket engines to design a moon mining vehicle weighing over 800 kilograms. When the moon mining vehicle reaches a site containing water ice, its engine enclosed in the dome will start up, launching the water ice-laden debris into a vacuum device that separates and stores the water ice particles.\nAccording to the plan, this moon mining vehicle is capable of mining operations from twelve craters per day. Each crater can produce about 100 kilograms of ice and more than 420,000 kilograms of lunar water ice can be recovered each year.\nBesides lunar water ice, the Artemis programme also includes research into the extraction of helium-3. Helium-3 (He-3) is a very valuable resource in space, and its presence on earth is rather limited. It is formed by the decay of tritium (hydrogen-3, the third isotope of the element hydrogen, after protium and deuterium). In the soil of the moon surface, there is one million tonnes of helium-3.\nHelium-3 can continuously supply energy to the moonbase. If the fusion energy of helium-3 is used, just 200,000 tonnes of helium-3 can enable a population of nearly one and a half billion people to use electricity for an entire year. It is also very likely that this type of space minerals will change the energy process of rockets and cause a qualitative transformation of human space technology.\nNASA has quickly embarked on the project to return to the moon, mainly because the satellite soil collected by the Chinese probes on the moon contains this type of future energy.\nNASA must also complete the technology to withstand space radiation for the Artemis project. The surface of the moon, like the surface of Mars, is not protected by an ozone layer. This is precisely the reason why space radiation there is very high. Studies have shown that space radiation can easily penetrate the bulkheads of manned spacecraft and pass through crew members\u2019 bodies. Space radiation can damage the DNA of crew members, causing a number of irreparable consequences.\nWith a view to solving the threat of space radiation, NASA approached the research institutes of the University of Washington and Harvard University to ask for collaboration and participation in studies. In the high-tech competition, they found a very powerful small molecule. It plays an important role in repairing DNA damaged by space radiation and in restoring muscle and skeletal loss in weightlessness.\nThis molecule is involved in the synthesis of cofactors in human cells and is a substance found in the human body and in nature. People can restore or increase the level of cellular cofactors in the body by supplementing the molecule, which is able to restore declining mitochondria and repair damaged DNA. Likewise, astronauts can also repair damaged DNA by supplementing the molecule after having been exposed to space radiation.\nNASA has collected a large amount of data on the radiation exposure of astronauts during space activities over the past decades. Based on this data, the Ames Research Center \u2013 one of NASA\u2019s ten largest centres, located in California\u2019s Silicon Valley at Moffett Field Airport \u2013 has developed a roadmap for radiation resistance in the human body. In the roadmap, NASA plans to use modern gene editing technology to modify astronauts\u2019 DNA so that they can adapt to the high-radiation space environment.\nJudging by the current level of technology, however, when we return to the moon in 2024, it is estimated that gene editing technology will not yet have reached the point where it can affect astronauts\u2019 DNA. NASA can rely on the aforementioned molecule, which will be safe and reliable only after marketing. A few years ago, some biological companies focused on studying molecules against ageing and on restoring levels to cope with mitochondrial diseases.\nScientific tests and marketing have demonstrated the molecule safety, and NASA wants to use this material to complete the relevant tests on the moonbase before it can be used in large-scale space activities.\nThe moon is the closest celestial body to the earth, and is a unique outpost for humans to improve space technology. Although it looks desolate, it contains a lot of energy that the earth does not have. Humans can probably improve aerospace technology on the moon to a higher level than on earth.\nIt must be said, however, that if we are serious about mining or other activities on the moon, concluding relevant binding treaties is essential, and all countries carrying out space activities must be able to comply with them. In this way, the moon is protected and severe consequences are avoided for what will happen \u201cin the sky\u201d if there is conflict on earth.\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:EconomicsfeaturedScienceSpaceUSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nPsychedelic drugs, monkey brains and rescue drones to feature in cutting-edge research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGiancarlo Elia Valori\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory Board Co-chair Honoris Causa\n\nProfessor Giancarlo Elia Valori is an eminent Italian economist and businessman.

Still, don\u2019t expect to fly in a plane powered by electricity anytime soon.\nDr Pascal Belin, a neuroscientist at the Aix-Marseille University in France and primary investigator in the EU-funded COVOPRIM project, studies humans and monkeys to understand better what happens in the brains of primates when they communicate. Scans show a remarkable similarity in the way human, marmoset and macaque brains light up when a voice is heard from another member of their species. Next year, researchers plan to implant electrodes in monkey brains to investigate this phenomenon at a nerve-cell level. The implications are far-reaching, both for people who lose the ability to speak following a brain injury or stroke and for general human interaction with technology. \n\u2018Soon, we\u2019ll be able to interpret the activity of neurons in different regions of the brain very clearly. We\u2019re already understanding better and better which region does what. Soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to decode what someone is listening to simply by observing brain activity. We\u2019ll also be able to elucidate what people are imagining without their thoughts being vocalised. It\u2019s not quite the same as reading someone\u2019s thoughts \u2013 it\u2019s more about reconstructing what\u2019s going on in the brain by interpreting the activity of neurons. \n\u2018In time, our new knowledge will also be used to control machines. More and more progress is already being made in this area. There will be neural implants, the kind already fitted in some epileptic patients when they don\u2019t respond to treatment, that can be strategically placed in the brain to enhance a person\u2019s perception \u2013 much like a cochlear implant is used today in thousands of deaf people so they can hear \u2013 or to send impulses that command a computer.\n\u2018It will mean people can express themselves without using a keyboard. A keyboard and pen are awkward crutches that have been necessary in our path towards technological innovation to allow us to convert verbal information in our brain into written words, but they won\u2019t be necessary once your computer can read that information directly from your brain. Though I\u2019m not a specialist in brain-computer interfaces, I believe this sort of innovation will be available in five to 10 years, not 40.\u2019\nTomorrow\u2019s cities will improve the safety of residents and structures alike, according to Professor Gian Paolo Cimellaro, an engineer at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy. Prof Cimellaro led the EU-funded IDEAL DRONE project to develop drones that can be deployed by firefighters to help locate people trapped in burning buildings. He believes techniques to monitor structures and rescue civilians will improve immensely in the coming years.\n\u2018We\u2019ll see huge change in the field of disaster resilience \u2013 both in the short- and medium-term. The advanced technologies we\u2019ve been working on mean people can be tracked inside buildings and soon we\u2019ll be able to do even better. For instance, rescue teams will wear exoskeletons \u2013 rugged suits that synchronise with their movement and give them protection and strength \u2013 so they can move heavy debris to get to survivors.\n\u2018Climate change will put more pressure on infrastructures, meaning disasters will happen more frequently, so we\u2019ll need to build greater resilience into all civilian infrastructure. Whenever there\u2019s a disaster, such as a partial bridge collapse, functionality drops and there\u2019s a recovery process. We\u2019ll be minimising the downtime. To stick with the bridge example, the only way to know if a bridge is safe today is through visual inspection: the engineer looks at the deck and decides whether or not to replace a part. But soon, sensors will become cheaper and bridges will be covered in them. These will report back on levels of ageing. That way, when a problem is detected, it can be fixed before it becomes a crisis.\n\u2018Eventually, we\u2019ll have \u2018\u2018super artificial intelligence\u2019\u2019, where a machine is smarter than the engineer and can inspect a structure and perform actions better than any human. For very long bridges, inspection will be done by drones equipped with robots that will collect multiple sets of information at the same time using high-resolution cameras, thermal cameras and laser scanners.\u2019\nPsychedelic drugs, when paired with specialist psychotherapy, show great promise as treatments for chronic, tricky mental illnesses. Scientists in Europe and the US including Dr Claudia Schwarz-Plaschg are unravelling the neuroscience of psychedelic \u2018trips\u2019, hoping to bring an end to debilitating conditions like depression and trauma. Dr Schwarz-Plaschg completed the EU-funded ReMedPsy project in which she examined society\u2019s evolving views on these substances.\n\u2018I envisage research into the benefits of psychedelics moving beyond mental-health issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction to include any condition where mind and body are integrated \u2013 from autism and dementia to obesity and pain disorders. I also anticipate more research into how psychedelics can enhance creativity and help with problem solving, as these substances are known to foster shifts in perspective.\n\u2018In terms of risks, we also need more studies into the adverse effects of psychedelics. Bad trips happen and can be very destabilising. I expect we\u2019ll see the broader conversation on drug decriminalisation and legalisation move forward in the next few years, and this will include psychedelics.\n\u2018I also anticipate more research into the spiritual and religious benefits of these substances. We\u2019re undergoing a spiritual crisis in western society. Psychedelics could play a role in helping people find deeper meaning in life again. I hope 2023 will enable me and other critical scholars to scrutinise how knowledge is created in this field. What impact does psychedelic research have on communities that have been using psychedelics for much longer than Western science? Are we extracting knowledge from Indigenous and underground communities without giving back?\u2019\nBecause air travel contributes to global warming, European researchers are exploring the potential of electric and hybrid engines to reduce jets\u2019 carbon footprint. With today\u2019s batteries still some way from being ready for commercial use, Fabio Russo, head of research at Italian aircraft maker Tecnam and coordinator of the EU-funded H3PS project, says real progress requires airlines to make tangible commitments.\n\u2018Our company is putting resources and engineering into developing new technologies for both all-electric and hybrid aircraft. However, all-electric batteries work only in light aircraft with a flying time of around 20 or 30 minutes plus reserve, so clearly that\u2019s unlikely to work for people wanting to fly even short-haul in commercial airliners.\n\u2018Why are things not moving as fast as we\u2019d like? Because, even though we see lots of press releases from airlines expressing their intention to be on a sustainable path, only rarely something tangible then happens. There is no progressive business model, no meaningful commitments when it comes to making pledges about purchases of cleaner aircraft. This does not help manufacturers to safely unlock huge investments. And this needs to change or else engineers, manufacturers and airlines will jeopardise their credibility.\n\u2018Currently, a battery can no longer be used in aircraft once its performance drops below 90% because, at this point, the flight range becomes severely compromised and there\u2019s an increased risk of the battery overheating. This means that after around 800 flight cycles \u2013 typically a few weeks of flying \u2013 the battery needs to be removed and a new one bought for likely many thousands of euros. And that\u2019s just for a nine-passenger aircraft with very low range. This is too costly to make business sense, plus it\u2019s environmentally wasteful. Over the next few years, I hope we find ways to make batteries last longer and allow them to be \u201coverhauled\u201d, meaning the airline would give its battery back to the manufacturer and get another with new cells. The old battery would then be sold to power other machines like consumer electronics or those used for energy storage.\u2019\nFresh-water supplies are diminishing around the world. As populations grow and droughts worsen, scientists are seeking new ways to convert high-saline water (as exists in oceans) into a form that can be piped into homes and industry. George Brik is chief executive officer of Hydro Volta, a Belgium-based company with a patented desalination technology. Developed in the EU-funded SonixED project, the technology is a lot greener than anything used today, requiring far less energy and fewer chemicals.\n\u2018The world has an unlimited supply of seawater but it\u2019s wasteful, expensive and harsh on the environment to desalinate water using traditional techniques. This is where Hydro Volta can help. Our technology makes the conversion of seawater to fresh water both cheaper and safer for the environment. All that\u2019s left is for us to scale up our processes and get the message across to governments and industry that we can help them solve an important and growing problem. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll get this opportunity over the next few years.\n\u2018I came to Belgium with my family as a survivor of the Syrian war 10 years ago. I was already working in the water-treatment industry in Syria, but I had to leave everything behind and start from scratch when I moved to Belgium, which was very difficult.\n\u2018But two years after arriving, I met a man named Yousef Yousef who became my business partner and co-founder and, from the start, the Flemish government and the EU have believed in our project and supported us. I\u2019m so thankful for the opportunity I have been given. Now all that\u2019s left is for us to be get the chance to take our technology out into the world.\u2019\nThis article was originally published\u202fin Horizon, the EU Research and Innovation Magazine.   \nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Technology\nThe Semiconductor Industry and its future\n\n\n \n\n\nPublished 6 days ago on December 25, 2022\n\n\nBy Anuj Dhyani \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSince the Covid19 outbreak and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, many industrialised and developing nations have understood the significance of supply chains and the risks they provide. This has been seen in the situations of numerous items, such as food and oil, whose supply was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war; it is now especially evident in the case of semiconductors.\nEvery nation, whether developed or developing, requires semiconductors since they are utilised in every electronic device and in a range of areas, including medical, healthcare, defence, renewable energy initiatives, and a number of upcoming projects, such as quantum computing. The leaders in the semiconductors race on the worldwide market are the United States, whose 2020 market share was valued at over $200 billion. The United States has been a pioneer in the export of semiconductors, commanding about 50 percent of the worldwide market. Semiconductors are one of the top export goods of the United States. Additionally, the United States invests more than one-fifth of their sales on research and development, placing them second only to the pharmaceutical business. China is another nation that is emerging as a major participant in the semiconductor race, since it has been making rapid progress in this arena. China\u2019s semiconductor industry has been growing since 2015, when it accounted for only 3.8% of the global supply race. However, in the last 5 years, China\u2019s semiconductor industry has grown from a mere $!3billion in 2015 to an annual growth rate of $40 billion market industry, and China now stands 1% behind Europe and Japan in the semiconductor race, as China\u2019s semiconductor industry accounts for 9% today and the Europe\u2019s and Japan\u2019s annual percentage growth rates are 2% and 3%, respectively. China has already eclipsed Taiwan in the semiconductor business during the previous two years. If China\u2019s semiconductor industry continues to develop at the same rate, its annual sales might reach $114 billion by 2024, placing it just behind the United States and South Korea.\nIndia\u2019s future with Semiconductors\nIndia\u2019s current semiconductor facilities are the Gallium Arsenide Enabling Technology Centre (GAETEC) and the Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL), but all this could change as India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed at the Indian Mobile Congress, which helped in highlighting India\u2019s scope and ambitions with the future technology which India t is developing. The government has begun to recognise the importance of semiconductors and how a domestic semiconductor industry could enable India to reduce its dependence on the giants of the Semiconductor industry and increase the \u2018Atmanhirbar Plan\u2019 of India. The Prime Minister of India aspires to make India a leader in cutting-edge technology, and semiconductors are a key component in achieving this objective. The United States has long sought to isolate its essential technology supply chains from China; India can provide an assist in this endeavour. In this cooperation, India is projected to contribute a total of $20 billion, which may help India become a superpower and compete with nations like China and European markets in the chip race. Many countries, not just the United States, are adopting a \u201cChina Plus One\u201d strategy to reduce their reliance on China and shift their markets to \u201clike-minded countries\u201d such as India. Many private companies, such as Tata and Adana, have also pledged multi-million dollar investments in this project, which can help India\u2019s semiconductor industry grow at a projected rate of $64 billion by 2026, representing a 19% annual growth rate. As India has been relatively weak in this sector, as India\u2019s imports of semiconductors inputs reached $21 billion in 2019 and that figure has been rising rapidly each year, the recent semiconductor manufacturing incentives offered by the government of India will also help the Indian economy as many American companies will expand their capacities in India and this will help in building the right supply chains worldwide and this will also help industries in India. This will also contribute to the growth of the Indian economy.\nConclusion\nWhile all of this is true and will help India in the long run and increase its presence on the global market, India must not forget that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. India must also keep in mind that chip manufacturing requires a great deal of raw materials and that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. The India-United States cooperation cannot be viewed as restrictive to any particular field, and with the rapidly changing geopolitical situation, it is important to remember that China, which is a producer of electronics, is also a consumer, and that one must observe how the semiconductor and high-end chip industries continue and how demand develops.\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Technology\nAI\u2019s Malicious Use and Challenges to International Psychological Security\n\n\n \n\n\nPublished 1 week ago on December 24, 2022\n\n\nBy Evgeny Pashentsev \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn December 2022, the International Center for Social and Political Studies and Consulting published the second report \u201cExperts on the Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to International Psychological Security\u201d, penned by this author. This report stems from the research project titled \u201cMalicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to Psychological Security in Northeast Asia\u201d (21-514-92001) and jointly funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) and the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences (VASS). The responses garnered from a targeted survey of twenty-five experts from twelve countries and the subsequent analysis of their feedback aim to bring to light the most serious threats to international information-psychological security (IPS) through malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI), determining how dangerous these threats are, which measures should be used to neutralize them, and identifying the prospects for international cooperation in this area.\nThis publication attempts to define the current level of MUAI threat to the IPS as well as its possible level by 2030. The report pays special attention to the situation in Northeast Asia (NEA), where MUAI practices are based on a combination of a high level of AI technologies in leading countries and a complex of acute contradictions in the region. The results of the second survey allow us to trace the continuity and changes in expert assessments compared to the first survey conducted a year earlier, in which nineteen experts from ten countries took part.\nIn the year since the first expert survey, the world has become even more unstable and dangerous. NATO\u2019s aggressive advance to the East provoked a massive military conflict in Ukraine, one that risks escalating into a world war. Gross domestic product in Ukraine is expected to decline 35 to 40 percent in 2022; Russia also expects a decline of 2,5 percent for the same period. There are clear signs of a recession in the U.S. and the EU, with this economic slowdown reaching even China. Unprecedented inflation, rising borrowing costs, and increasingly intimidating levels of indebtedness are all contributing to fears of economic collapse in many Western and non-Western countries. However, even amid COVID-19, the ultra-rich have little to worry about. In 2022, Forbes identified more than 1,000 billionaires around the world who were richer than they were a year prior (Dolan and Peterson-Withorn, 2022). This deepening polarization in living standards inevitably intensifies the world\u2019s most acute political, racial, and national conflicts across both developing and rich countries\u2014including the United States, long thought immune to such turmoil. In a sick society, threats to psychological security through the malicious use of AI are much higher than in a socially healthy environment. Especially if social regression is observed against the background of the ongoing progress of high technologies.\nThe transition to advanced forms of AI is already happening. In 2022, DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet specializing in AI, announced the creation of an intelligent agent called \u201cGato\u201d that can single-handedly perform more than 600 of different tasks (MSN, 2022). The same network, with the same weights, can play Atari video games, capture images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more. Gato decides whether to produce text, torque joints, press buttons or take other actions based on context (DeepMind, 2022). The agent could outperform human experts in 450 tasks. Gato learns several different tasks at the same time, easily switching from one skill to another without forgetting what it has learned. Previous AI models have started to combine different skills but when starting a new task, these models had to forget what was previously learned in order to move on to the next one. However, Gato does make some mistakes that a human would not make. While Gato is still far from being an AGI creation, progress is still evident. In terms of malicious use, an agent similar to Gato repeatedly, if not by orders of magnitude, reduces the cost of preparing and implementing various actions by one agent. This makes it easier to carry out psychological operations with a combined effect on the senses\u2014an intelligent agent like Gato can simultaneously send text messages, conduct a conversation and so on.\nModern AI capabilities already enable one to influence public consciousness. The president-elect of South Korea, Yoon Suk-yeol, used an unusual strategy during his 2022 election campaign. His campaign team used deepfakes to make an \u201cAI avatar\u201d that helped him win the election. This technology is helpful for appealing to younger voters and to get them more involved (Vastmindz 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s creators believe he is the world\u2019s first official deepfake candidate\u2014a concept that is gaining traction in South Korea, which has the world\u2019s fastest average internet speeds (AFP 2022). AI technology transformed Yoon Suk-yeol into a more modern candidate than his competitors from the perspective of younger voters. With neatly combed, black hair and a smart suit, the avatar looks nearly identical to the real candidate but instead, used salty language and meme-ready quips in a bid to engage younger voters who get their news online (AFPRelaxnews 2022). Some alarms were raised when the avatar politician used humor to try and deflect attention from Yoon\u2019s past scandals (The Times of India 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s pronouncements made headlines in the South Korean media, and seven million people visited the \u201cWiki Yoon\u201d website to question the avatar (AFP 2022). At first glance, AI Yoon could pass for an actual candidate\u2014an apt demonstration of how far artificially generated videos have come in the last few years. \u201cWords that are often spoken by Yoon are better reflected in AI Yoon,\u201d said Baik Kyeong-hoon, director of the AI Yoon team (AFP 2022). However, there is a question about what should be done if the avatar of a statesman, politician or business person is a false representation, reinforcing in the public\u2019s conscious and subconscious mind inflated qualities, creating the illusion of attributes that the real person does not possess. The experience of South Korea\u2019s last presidential campaign may have shown, in part, the initial form of a new method of rather dangerous political manipulation. An increasingly adaptive avatar that does not need rest creates an image that a real person will be able to compete with less and less in the public space. This prompts the question of whether \u201ctelevised presidents\u201d will soon be replaced by \u201cdeepfake presidents\u201d?\nThe world\u2019s first AI TV news anchor was unveiled in China in 2018 (Kuo, 2018), and they were immediately noticeable as the result of an algorithm. However, in December 2021, AI company Xiaoice introduced N Xiaohei and N Xiaobai\u2014virtual replicas of two real-life news anchors\u2014on \u201cAI Business Daily.\u201d According to the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, Xiaoice, in collaboration with National Business Daily, has demonstrated a strong ability to develop virtual replicas that are effectively indistinguishable from real humans through advanced machine learning (ML) and rendering technologies (Lin, 2022). Unfortunately, these extraordinary achievements have the potential to be used for malicious purposes by anti-social actors aiming to destabilize the public consciousness, provoke anti-social actions, and/or deceive individuals.\nNotably, this risk is not purely theoretical, with deepfakes having been used on several occasions to trick companies into sending money by them (Statt, 2019; Stupp, 2019; Veldkamp, 2022). Of course, this practice is not yet common, meaning that the risk is fairly minor\u2014for now. In June 2022, the FBI warned that scammers are beginning to use deepfakes to apple for sensitive jobs; this type of fraud could be used to gain access to company networks and obtain company data (Ferraro and Chipman, 2022).\nAI technologies are being tested in military conflicts, including psychological warfare. The use of Western-produced AI technologies in the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is significant. US facial recognition startup Clearview AI has provided technical support to Ukraine. Clearview AI\u2019s tools can identify faces in videos, comparing them to a company database of 20 billion images from public networks, identifying potential spies and people who have been killed. AI tools also play an important role in Ukraine\u2019s propaganda war and in processing critical conflict information. A program from the US company Primer can perform speech recognition, transcription and translation that captures and analyzes Russian information, including conversations between Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The Swiss encrypted chat service called Threema allows Ukrainian users to send this data to the military without revealing their identities. According to former Google chief executive officer Eric Schmidt, now an AI adviser to the US government, the Ukrainian military receives thousands of such reports every day, which are then filtered by an AI program (Global Times, 2022). Russia has not been slow to respond. The Russian Federation\u2019s Ministry of Defense Office for the Development of Artificial Intelligence conducted an examination of the innovative projects to be presented at the Army 2022 Forum for AI technology use (IMTF \u201cArmy\u20132022,\u201d 2022). Vasily Elistratov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s Department for the Development of AI Technologies, said that special military operation experience in Ukraine is used to improve weapons systems (Ixbt.com, 2022). Unfortunately, the arms race that is growing in terms of both size and participation, not least in the field of AI, is making international security, including its psychological component, less and less durable.\nThe potential for MUAI today is astounding. Noting this, researchers from Collaborations Pharmaceuticals in cooperation with European scientific institutions conducted a conceptual experiment. Instead of synthesizing new drugs, they asked the opposite of the MegaSyn AI neural network: to identify substances that are the most toxic to the human body. The neural network correctly understood the task and, in under six hours, generated a list of 40,000 substances that are optimal components of chemical and biological weapons. The AI independently designed not only many known chemical warfare agents, but also many new ones that are more toxic. This simple inversion of the ML model turned a harmless generative model from a useful tool into an enabler of mass murder (Urbina et al., 2022). It is reasonable to suspect that this inversion approach could be applied to other areas, such as finding optimal ways to have negative psychological impacts on the public consciousness.\nThe most worrisome aspect of these mounting concerns is simple: legislative responses are lagging behind. The sluggish speed of the legislative process (especially relative to that of the MUAI-development process) is clear in the fact that, for example, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, at the time of writing this text, has not yet passed the first reading in the European Parliament (EUR-Lex, 2022).\nIn analyzing the current international situation, most studies focus on economic, military, and geopolitical changes without sufficiently linking them to the growing impact of qualitative technological changes on international dynamics, including those in the sphere of psychological security. This underestimation is clear in the near-complete lack in the literature of a systemic analysis of the possible risks of MUAI to psychological security at individual, group, national, and international levels. The absence of such an analysis is unacceptable for numerous reasons.\nFirst, the penetration of modern AI into countless spheres of life makes it a critical component of continued development and progress. Investment in AI may consist of trillions of dollars within the next two decades. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers Middle East (PwC) report released at the World Government Summit in Dubai, 14 per cent (U.S. $15.7 trillion) of global economic growth will stem from the use of AI by 2030. PwC believes that the greatest gains in 2030 will be in China, where AI will be responsible for up to 26 percent of economic growth (Rao and Verweij, 2018, p. 3). However, as already established, alongside AI\u2019s development will come tremendous risks, including in the field of psychological security.\nSecond, there is already some research into international practices of MUAI in the psychological field. It is short-sighted not to continue existing research on a systemic interdisciplinary basis, taking into account the counter progress of AI technologies and the regression of existing public structures, national and international institutions, and simply wait until the consequences of AI become an even greater threat to international security. At the same time, strong support from state and non-state actors is required for such research that goes beyond such areas as cybersecurity and information security, as well as psychological security before the introduction of AI technologies, because we are talking about qualitatively different possibilities of causing irreparable damage to the development of human civilization than simply quantitative expansion of propaganda capabilities.\nThird, the international situation is continually worsening in several respects. This is not because of particular politicians being in power but because of the severity of the problems faced during the transition to a qualitatively new stage in human development. This transition has been accompanied by an increase in economic problems, socio-political tensions, and geopolitical competition. AI can become both the technological foundation of a new, more socially oriented world order, and the tool of high-tech undemocratic dictatorships, actively used for antisocial purposes by various non-state actors.\nThe conducted expert survey and the subsequent analysis of its results are precisely intended to fill the gap in the awareness of the nature and scope of threats to society associated with modern and future MUAI practices in the context of the global crisis, as well as an assessment of possible risks in this area in the near future. Further research in this direction obviously follows from the nature and dynamics of the changes taking place in the world.\nFrom our partner RIAC\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n Humanity Amidst Insanity: Hope during and after the Indo-Pak Partition\n\n\n\n\n Warriors after War.

    "Featuring robot spiders, lava fields, far-flung galaxies, no-bum microbes, historic starbursts and much much more. When it comes to photography, the James Webb Space Telescope stole the show in 2022, with visuals that reminded us what an outrageously beautiful place the Universe can be (see more on that below). But to tell the truth, over the last 12 months there was no shortage of mind-blowing images that changed our perspectives. Here\u2019s our selection of the best, and what they taught us\u2026 Event Horizon Telescope \u2013 12 May You would have thought if there was a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Galaxy, we\u2019d have noticed it before. But that\u2019s the thing about black holes: you can\u2019t see them. You can only see the gas whirling around them. The one at the centre of the Milky Way, named Sagittarius A*, is around 27,000 light-years away from Earth and we only found it by training eight radio telescopes on it all at the same time. It took 300 researchers and their supercomputers five years to analyse the data they collected before they could finally release this first portrait of the previously unseen object. Yukon, Canada \u2013 21 June This 30,000-year-old baby woolly mammoth, \u2018Nun cho ga\u2019 (big baby animal), takes her name from the H\u00e4n language spoken by Indigenous peoples in Yukon, Canada, where she was found in June. Nun cho ga\u2019s remains were discovered by gold miners and rescued by geologists. It\u2019s thought she probably died after getting stuck in mud, which would have initially preserved her body, but permafrost kept her intact over the millennia. DNA has previously been extracted from much older mammoths, but none so well preserved. Her future is in the hands not just of scientists, but also of the Tr\u2019ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch\u2019in people who own the land where she was found. Jezero crater, Mars \u2013 19 April These shattered remains may look like a failed space mission, but they\u2019re very much a sign of success \u2013 for two reasons. First, these are the backshell and parachute of NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover \u2013 landing gear the robot no longer needed after surviving a 126km/h descent to the surface of Mars in 2021. Second, the picture was taken by Ingenuity, a miniature helicopter with a metre-wide rotor span that caught a ride to the Red Planet with the rover. Ingenuity has a flight range of only 300m but, as of November 2022, had clocked up 34 flights and covered a total of 7km. Images like these help NASA to understand whether a landing occurred as expected and what could be improved for future missions. Read more about space exploration: Servion, Switzerland \u2013 May Hatched at a Swiss zoo in May, this newborn tortoise is the first example of an albino Galapagos giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) known in captivity or the wild. Its mother, pictured in the background, and sibling are both black. According to the zoo, albinism is rarer in tortoises than in humans, with the chance of any tortoise being albino estimated to be around 1 in 100,000. However, while this baby may be unique, its lack of the skin pigment melanin makes it particularly susceptible to skin cancer. In the wild, this extra threat to an already endangered species would seem to make survival unlikely, but in captivity it can be kept out of sunlight. Read more about tortoises and turtles: International research team \u2013 17 August Are we descended from a 530-million-year-old animal with a giant mouth and no anus? Apparently not. Well, good. That\u2019s one thing scientists have sorted out this year. We\u2019re all done here. Unless, of course, you\u2019re wondering whose family tree this bumless blob (officially Saccorhytus coronarius) belongs to. The answer, according to the latest thinking, is crabs, spiders and roundworms. Previous evidence linking it to our line was based on limited specimens. The new work, involving high-resolution imaging and many specimens, enabled researchers to create the detailed reconstructions shown here. Rice University, Texas \u2013 25 July Researchers from Rice University thought it would be fun to turn a dead spider into a robotic gripper, in order to pick up other objects. Overkill, perhaps, but they claim that it heralds a new era of \u2018necrobotics\u2019 (robots made from dead things). Actually, their technique is pretty simple: take a spider, stick a syringe in it, then apply pressure by squirting air into its cold, dead body. This works because spiders use hydraulics to force haemolymph (their version of blood) into their limbs, forcing them to extend. When spiders die, they lose this ability, and so they curl up. Dimorphos \u201326 September This was one of the last images NASA\u2019s DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) spacecraft transmitted. Just 11 seconds later, it crashed into its target, the asteroid Dimorphos (pictured here from 68km away), at around 24,000km/h. Despite being fatal for the spacecraft, the mission proved a hit for the US space agency. After crunching the data, it confirmed that DART had successfully altered the trajectory of Dimorphos in its orbit around its parent asteroid, Didymos. So, hopefully, when bigger, badder asteroids look set to destroy Earth, we now have the knowledge to send them off-course. University of Cambridge, UK \u2013 7 March Two-thirds of a millimetre might not sound very tall, but when you\u2019re a bacterium, it\u2019s bigger than the Empire State Building. It\u2019s also the height of these 600-micrometre-high \u2018nano-skyscrapers\u2019, which are actually tiny 3D-printed towers of electrodes that UK researchers built to house light-harvesting organisms called cyanobacteria, which make their energy via photosynthesis, just like plants. The towers are designed to cram in as many cyanobacteria as possible while maximising their exposure to sunlight. By plugging into the electrodes, the scientists show that it\u2019s possible to use cyanobacteria as a source of sustainable energy. New Mexico, USA \u2013 September This is SpinLaunch: a prototype system for launching satellites and other payloads into space using kinetic energy instead of the chemical fuel in traditional rockets. The prototype is a third of the size of the planned 100m-wide full-scale system, but is capable of spinning payloads at 8,000km/h and 10,000G before flinging them skyward through a launch tube. Although small rocket engines will still be needed to get payloads into orbit, it\u2019s claimed the system cuts down on fuel and infrastructure by around 70 per cent. In April, SpinLaunch signed a \u2018Space Act Agreement\u2019 with NASA and by September was testing the system with components of the space agency\u2019s own satellites. International Space Station \u2013 22 July On 22 July, Samantha Cristoforetti emerged from the airlock of the International Space Station (ISS) as the first-ever European woman to take a spacewalk. There was no time to bask in the glory though, as the Italian astronaut had work to do on the new European Robotic Arm (ERA), a robotic attachment to the space station designed to cut down on the need for human spacewalks. Staying outside for seven hours in all, she and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev installed new parts on the ERA. In September, Cristoforetti became the first female European commander of the ISS before returning to Earth safely in October. Norwich, UK \u2013 21 October Plants don\u2019t have nerves. For a long time, though, scientists were fascinated by the fact that they seemed to deploy one of the chemical messengers that humans use to transmit nerve impulses \u2013 calcium \u2013 when they get injured. However, this year, scientists at the John Innes Centre in the UK used new fluorescent imaging techniques (pictured here in cress seedlings) to show that this calcium rush isn\u2019t a moving wave or impulse. Instead, it\u2019s a response to another chemical, glutamate, that\u2019s released at the injury site. Glutamate molecules travel along the corridors between plant cells, triggering the opening of cell \u2018doors\u2019 that let out calcium as they go. So it\u2019s glutamate, not calcium, that\u2019s the messenger. Curtin University, Australia \u2013 12 July In 2011, a nomad named Bahba picked up a lump of black rock in the Sahara Desert. It turned out to be a piece of 4.5-billion-year-old meteorite forged in magma chambers below the surface of a young Mars and flung to Earth when a comet hit the Red Planet 5-10 million years ago. Now known as \u2018Black Beauty\u2019, it took scientists until this year to pinpoint the meteorite\u2019s origins in the Terra Cimmeria-Sirenum province (circled). The Australian team did it by analysing 94 million Martian craters, colour-coded here by age and size. Given Black Beauty is so old, they think the region could hold clues to the planet\u2019s early history. Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland \u2013 3 August Iceland is well known for its lava fields, but new volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula close to Reykjavik is proving particularly accessible to day-trippers from the capital. This eruption in the Meradalir Valley, starting on 3 August, attracted thrill-seeking hikers to a 300km fissure in the Earth\u2019s crust that, within a fortnight, had spewed out 10 million cubic metres of lava. It came just a year after another large vent opened up a kilometre away. Until then, the region hadn\u2019t seen any major volcanic activity since the 12th Century, when medieval Iceland was ruled over by chieftains known as go\u00f0or\u00f0. Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory \u2013 9 October Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) emanate from high-energy explosions occurring when massive stars much hotter than our Sun collapse to form black holes or neutron stars. Pictured is GRB 221009A, the brightest GRB ever witnessed, detected on 9 October and lasting a full 10 hours. It was so bright that even the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope \u2013 designed specifically for GRBs \u2013 couldn\u2019t deal with what it was emitting. But as the energy emitted by such an explosion is converted into different kinds of radiation, the X-ray telescope aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was able to capture this image from X-rays as they bounced off dust in the Galaxy. GRB 221009A took place about 1.9 billion light-years away, which is close in GRB terms. Al-Rastan, Syria \u2013 12 October Part of this 120m mosaic was unearthed in the Syrian city of Al-Rastan during the Syrian Civil War, but it\u2019s only now that archaeologists have been able to excavate it more completely. The 1,600-year-old artwork, photographed in October, depicts scenes of soldiers fighting in the Trojan War, which according to Greek mythology involved the Greeks sneaking into the city of Troy in a wooden horse. It may extend even further than 120m2 \u2013 the excavation is still ongoing. Other artworks and places of historical importance, including mosaics and churches, were destroyed during the Syrian conflict in the last decade, but museum researchers still hope to discover more beneath the ruins. London, UK \u2013 12 July This stunning image beamed to Earth by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveals details of far-flung regions of the Milky Way that we\u2019ve never seen before. Launched on Christmas Day 2021, from a spaceport in French Guiana, the JWST is the largest telescope ever sent into space. It uses infrared light to show us stars that were previously obscured from view by dust. Its first images, broadcast here to crowds in Piccadilly Circus, London, show the edge of a star-forming region around 7,600 light-years from Earth, in the Carina Nebula, which is home to stars millions of times brighter than our Sun. Read more about the James Webb Space Telescope: Mexico City, Mexico \u2013 18 October The Atlas 2030 exoskeleton was specially designed for children by Spanish robotics engineer and inventor, Elena Garc\u00eda Armada. Until now, exoskeletons have been a high-tech addition to rehab programmes for adult patients who have suffered strokes or traumatic brain and spinal injuries. But the suits can\u2019t just be downsized for children, whose physical limitations are more often related to neurological conditions \u2013 as in the case of David Zabala (pictured), who has cerebral palsy. These conditions require a more \u2018intelligent\u2019 suit that can read the intention of the walker and adapt its gait accordingly.

    "The modern TV news studio is a masterpiece of live video and CGI, as networks vie for the flashiest presentation. BBC News in London is no exception, and embraced the future in 2013 to the extent of replacing its flesh-and-blood camera operators with robotic cameras. On the face of it this made sense; it was cheaper, and newsroom cameras are most likely to record as set range of very similar shots. A decade later they\u2019re to be retired in a victory for humans, as the corporation tires of the stream of viral fails leaving presenters scrambling to catch up. A media story might seem slim pickings for Hackaday readers, however there\u2019s food for thought in there for the technically minded. It seems the cameras had a set of pre-programmed maneuvers which the production teams could select for their different shots, and it was too easy for the wrong one to be enabled. There\u2019s also a suggestion that the age of the system might have something to do with it, but this is somewhat undermined by their example which we\u2019ve placed below being from when the cameras were only a year old. Given that a modern TV studio is a tightly controlled space and that detecting the location of the presenter plus whether they are in shot or not should not have been out of reach in 2013, so we\u2019re left curious as to why they haven\u2019t taken this route. Perhaps OpenCV to detect a human, or simply detecting the audio levels on the microphones before committing to a move could do the job. Either way we welcome the camera operators back even if we never see them, though we\u2019ll miss the viral funnies.   Honestly\u2026 to me, this looks more like a bad interface design. Yeah, that\u2019s how I understood the article as presented as well.  Seems more like a case study of now not to do a user interface. Hi Jenny  I\u2019m afraid this is wrong. \u201cEmbraced the future in 2013 to the extent of replacing its flesh-and-blood camera operators with robotic cameras. \u201d BBC News hasn\u2019t had human camera operators on the studio floor much at all in its history of TV news production. Remember the 1990s blue cut glass studio?  That had robotic camera pedestals remotely controlled from the control room.  Remote control camera mountings such as those from Evershed Powers Optics/EPO, Radamec, Vinten, Shotoku, Furio and now Electric Friends have been in use by BBC News since the late 1950s or early 1960s. News had them at Alexandra Palace before they moved to TV Centre.  A few times in the history of BBC News bulletin production they have reintroduced a floor operator or two for very high profile programmes like the Six and Ten O\u2019Clock News \u2013 but News 24 has relied on directors to remotely control cameras since it launched in 1997\u2026  The change that happened with the move from TV Centre to NBH in 2013 was not related to the use of remote cameras \u2013 that was business as usual. The change was instead due to a change in how the remote cameras were controlled.  In 2013 the newsroom automation system that also controls vision mixing, graphics, screen routing, captions etc. was expanded in scope to also recall preset camera shots based on instructions entered in the newsroom scripting system.  If these codes are entered incorrectly / the presenter misunderstands where they should be these change.  AIUI the recent reporting in Deadline around this may be related to a possible procurement discussion about replacing the 10 year old Furio remote controlled track cameras in one or two studios with a replacement.  I directed BBC News 24 and then BBC One/Six/Nine/Ten O\u2019Clock bulletins daily from 1997 to 2007 \u2013 and I can assure you we seldom had \u2018flesh and blood camera operators\u2019 on the studio floor.  You had remote controlled cameras that were remotely controlled either by the director or a single lighting/camera/vision operator from the studio control room.  If the camera pedestals needed to be repositioned in the studios that didn\u2019t have fully robotic pedestals, the floor manager would reposition them, off shot. This is why I love HAD.  Also, I bet you have some stories to share\u2026? Broadcast engineer here at a location where we make use of robotic cameras.  Not with an automation system to operate the shots however.  We have a single robotic operator who can recall shots and override if issue arise. As Steve mentions this is not a robotic camera issue.  Miscues in the newsroom automation will cause this kind of malfunction.  If someone has the shots out of sequence OR one gets deleted when the scripts are being constructed, all bets are off. I have worked with Radamec, Shotoku, Fujinon, Telemetrics, and a host of other systems and with rare exception the robotics are rarely at fault. Somebody at BBC is making a terrible move by doing full on replacement.  What they should consider is preview software to run through the script and show the expected shots based on what the newsroom automation system will play out. My company will never adopt these automation systems for a variety of reasons, but the biggest reason is we like having a robotic operator at all times.  Yes, we save money by not needing to man 4 to 6 cameras for a news show.  But we also enjoy a live operator at all times.  Note that we do save shots and moves, but those are triggered by the same operator, not some automation software at the whim of a mistyped cue by a Production Assistant who doesn\u2019t know any better.  They tend to do copy/paste rather than check their work. For those interested : https://youtu.be/dEW-MW8SsMw?t=540 at about 9\u201900\u201d in shows the robotic cameras we had in BBC News in the late 90s. And here is a much earlier robot camera used in 1960ish :\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/p1.html\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/pix/epo-rob-boroc.pdf That is fascinating, thank you so much for sharing Is there a prospect for this job to operators a bit less equipped? Asking for a friend. Did we read the same article? Because right in the second paragraph: >The British broadcaster has begun the process of acquiring new automated cameras They are upgrading one set of robot cameras for another. I send back your ping-pong ball: > (Title) New cameras, same glitches\n>\n> The BBC has not disclosed how much the robot camera refit will cost, but the broadcaster has recent experience of installing new news studio cameras.\n>\n> Studio B, which is home to BBC1\u2019s flagship 10PM and 6PM bulletins, was revamped earlier this year with new automated cameras from Norwegian company Electric Friends.\n>\n>The technology has not been without problems, however. Just last month, a camera swung around to show the wrong part of the studio during Yeah.  And ironically, it says that one of the features of the old, buggier system was that it _did_ face tracking / ID.  (Apparently, not very well.) Live camera operators can have their moments also, not just automated cameras.\nBack in the 70\u2019s my late father was at a South Dakota television station to arrange broadcast ads for his furniture store. They took him into the studio to watch the live, evening news broadcast.\nThe weatherman was known for being all business, with no sense of humor. That night, before my father, the cameraman stepped from behind the camera and dropped his pants. At first, the weatherman did not respond, but then started laughing on camera. He was not laughing at the cameraman. He saw that the station manager\u2019s wife was standing in the back of the studio, witnessing the cameraman\u2019s antics. Former cameraman after something like that. This one from March 2021 is even better:\nhttps://youtu.be/Nos95w_oad8 Fabulous! I can see them going to \u201creality\u201d shooting like so many prime time TV shows. A modern lightweight handheld camera and plenty of coffee in the studio is all we need. I\u2019d prefer it if they went back to the \u2018good old days\u2019 \u2026\u2026  when they reported actual news and not propaganda\u2026.

They tend to do copy/paste rather than check their work.\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nSteve says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 2:28 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nFor those interested : https://youtu.be/dEW-MW8SsMw?t=540 at about 9\u201900\u201d in shows the robotic cameras we had in BBC News in the late 90s.\nAnd here is a much earlier robot camera used in 1960ish :\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/p1.html\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/pix/epo-rob-boroc.pdf\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nEric says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 8:33 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThat is fascinating, thank you so much for sharing\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nRumble_in_the_Jungle says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 4:31 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIs there a prospect for this job to operators a bit less equipped?

    "Front page layout Site theme \nJennifer Ouellette\n    -  Dec 30, 2022 11:04 pm UTC\n The 1967 Apollo 4 mission was an uncrewed flight to test the Saturn V rocket as a viable launch vehicle for future manned missions. The test was a smashing success and a critical step in the US space program. But the Saturn V was also incredibly loud\u2014so loud that a rumor emerged claiming that the acoustic energy was sufficient to melt concrete. That is not the case, according to an August paper published in a special educational issue if the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA). \"The Saturn V has taken on this sort of legendary, apocryphal status,\" said co-author Kenneth Gee of Brigham Young University. \"We felt that, as part of the JASA special issue on Education in Acoustics, it was an opportunity to correct misinformation about this vehicle.\" In addition to the authors' analysis, the paper includes several problems for students to solve relating to the event\u2014including a tongue-in-cheek problem involving using acoustic temperature to make a grilled cheese sandwich. German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who helped build the V-2 rocket, came to work for NASA in 1945 as part of Operation Paperclip. His job was to share his accumulated knowledge with the Army's rocket division. But when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 in 1957, priorities shifted and von Braun's team was charged with developing an equivalent US rocket. The Juno 1 launched the first US satellite in January 1958, and served as a prototype for the Saturn series for deployment for Earth orbit and lunar missions.. The Apollo 4 mission launched with a Saturn V on November 9, 1967, at 7 AM EST. When the five F-1 engines ignited eight seconds before liftoff, the sound pressure produced was so powerful that the waves buffeted the Vehicle Assembly Building, Launch Control Center, and press buildings even though the launch pad was more than three miles (five kilometers) away. CBS reporter Walter Cronkite and his producer had to hold onto their trailer's observation window as ceiling tiles fell to the floor, fearing it would shatter from the noise. Cronkite later claimed it was the most frightening space mission he'd covered. As one observer of a Saturn V launch described it: \"It's like continuous thunder, and when you think it can't get any louder, it does. I remember the vibration seeming to pass into my bones... The bird rises, the flames spew and the thunder continues, rising in pitch as it climbs, finally dissipating into a sound like a billion sheets of heavy paper being torn lengthwise for a whole minute.\" Something that memorable was bound to inspire a few exaggerated claims and unsubstantiated rumors over the ensuing decades. Gee et al. conducted a review of online forums and discussion boards, and were dismayed by the amount of disinformation that had proliferated on them. In addition to claiming the sound level was sufficient to melt concrete, there were claims that it lit \"grass ablaze over a mile away,\" and was powerful enough to \"ignite the hair of bystanders\" and \"blast rainbows from the sky.\" Per the authors, \"Such claims elicit awe at the power of the vehicle that propelled humans to the Moon, but are nevertheless based on a flawed understanding of the true acoustic environment.\" Their analysis of that acoustic environment incorporates NASA footage of the Apollo 17 launch\u2014digitized by the Discovery Channel for a 2008 documentary\u2014in which sound waves can actually be seen shortly after engine ignition because of the humid atmosphere and backlighting. Their physics-based model pegged the acoustic level at 203 decibels. Per Gee, 170 dB is equivalent to ten aircraft engines, while 200 dB is equivalent to 10,000 aircraft engines. Given that the human threshold for pain is around 130 dB, that's pretty darn loud. It just wasn't loud enough to melt concrete or set grass on fire. Gee et al. think the myth evolved out of confusion between sound power (comparable to a light bulb's wattage) and sound pressure (akin to the brightness of a light bulb) This would lead to faulty attempts to calculate the acoustic power of a Saturn V launch. If it turns out that reports of burning grass or melting concrete are confirmed, it would more likely be caused by radiative heating from the plume or debris\u2014not the sound of the Saturn V.

    "In 2022, decades of work finally came to fruition as the James Webb Space Telescope fired up and began training its unprecedented eyes on the universe. From distant galaxies to our nearby neighbors, let\u2019s look back at some of the most impressive images the telescope has captured so far. The successor to Hubble, James Webb scans the skies in infrared, and that combined with the unprecedented size of its mirror allows the telescope to peer deeper into space and further back in time than any other observatory. Using this power, Webb\u2019s mission is to study the formation and evolution of stars, planets and galaxies, especially those that formed soon after the Big Bang. It may even find the first signs of extraterrestrial life. NASA released the first batch of images to the public in July, including a view of a distant cluster of galaxies magnified by a gravitational lens, a nebula cast off from a dying star and another that\u2019s birthing new ones. Since then, James Webb has been busy producing image after stunning image, revealing new details of galaxies, nebulae and famous celestial landmarks like the Pillars of Creation. Closer to home, it showed Jupiter in a new light, and gave us the clearest look yet at Neptune\u2019s rings. And of course, this is just the beginning. James Webb is planned to examine the cosmos for at least the next decade, and if it\u2019s anything like its predecessor Hubble, its mission could be extended for another decade beyond that. So come take a look through the highlights of the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s first six months in operation in our gallery. Source: NASA on Flickr",

    "Tucked away in a small suburb on the outskirts of Boston, an Amazon Robotics facility serves as the unassuming birthplace of some of the company\u2019s most exciting technologies. From the outside, the facility looks like any other building in the area. On the inside, you\u2019ll find roboticists, technicians, and a host of other employees working on cutting-edge robots that will operate in fulfillment centers around the world\u2014making it easier and safer for employees to fulfill customer orders. Amazon recently invited nearly 100 reporters inside the facility for a rare look at the research and projects going on inside, and our team tagged along. Here are some of the most innovative things we found while roaming the halls of the Amazon Robotics facility in Westborough, Massachusetts. A nod to Amazon\u2019s innovation mindset greeted us in the lobby, where a digital art display of black metal rods and circular lights spanned a wall behind the reception desk. The slow, subtle light transitions were mesmerizing\u2014we could have stared at it all day. We made a quick stop at the coffee bar, then headed out to the manufacturing floor. The first thing we noticed in the vast facility was a series of fenced areas where robots are tested, including the Hercules robot. From its small blue base, this small but mighty robot lifts and carries up to a thousand pounds of product across designated areas of Amazon fulfillment centers. As we moved through the halls, we spotted the testing area for Robin, a robotic arm that handles packaged items in fulfillment centers. Smaller blue robots called Pegasus were delivering test packages to Robin to be picked up and placed on a conveyer belt. Also undergoing testing was an exciting new robotic arm called Sparrow. Jason Messinger, principal technical product manager with Amazon Robotics, took us to a restricted room at the back of the building for a sneak peek. Sparrow will be able to help employees working in fulfillment centers by picking individual items and storing them in inventory before the products are packaged and sent to customers. Messinger powered up Sparrow to give us a rare, first look at how it works.   When we were done marveling at Sparrow, Mikell Taylor, principal technical program manager for Amazon Robotics, took us to a special testing area where we met another new technology called Proteus.  Proteus is Amazon\u2019s first fully autonomous robot that will work alongside employees in fulfillment centers. The robots will transport heavy carts carrying packages for loading onto trucks for customer delivery. Proteus operates in open spaces in Amazon facilities, unlike previous-generation mobile robots that work in restricted areas. Proteus uses sensors and a map of the facility to safely navigate new spaces. A few of the robots were showing off their skills and moving around us while we were in the testing area. As we made our way through the rest of the testing floor, Taylor answered our burning question: How does Amazon choose the robots\u2019 names? She said the team takes inspiration from space to name Amazon\u2019s suite of mobile robots. Proteus, for example, is named after a moon of Neptune. Once we\u2019d satisfied our curiosities in the testing area, we headed to the manufacturing line where the robots are built. Erika McClosky, director of global robotics manufacturing at Amazon, gave us a full tour. She explained that there are 10 stations on each manufacturing line. Each line produces a robot every hour during production\u2014and Amazon can produce up to 1,000 robots each day.  McClosky walked us through the process of building Hercules, the small product-moving robot we saw earlier in the testing area. The manufacturing process starts with a simple base plate and ends with an incredibly strong, smart robot. McClosky explained that once the robots have made it through the manufacturing and testing process, they drive themselves to a charging station for one last charge before they go to their new home at an Amazon fulfillment center. After a long day of walking the floor at the Amazon Robotics facility\u2014and learning about all the innovative research and work being done inside\u2014we were ready to take ourselves home too. We bid adieu to the picturesque campus in Westborough and boarded a bus back to Boston. Until next time! Learn more about how Amazon Robotics support employees in fulfillment centers.",

    "Many traditionalist companies that tried to force their employees back to the office experienced extensive drama and stress over this coercive approach, and had to roll back their plans, with all that effort wasted. The monumental battle over remote work is heating up this winter as more traditionalist business leaders are demanding that their employees come to the office much or all of the time.  Google maps workers, asked to come back to the office full-time recently, fought back with a petition and threats of a strike, and won a reprieve of 90 days. Elon Musk demanded that all Tesla staff come to the office full-time despite insufficient spaces at Tesla offices, resulting in Tesla staff getting recruited by other companies. Apple employees are pushing back publicly against the leadership\u2019s demand for three days in the office, with a recent letter saying \u201cstop treating us like school kids who need to be told when to be where and what homework to do.\u201d\u202fGM rolled back its return to office requirement after a backlash from employees.  The same struggles are happening at smaller US companies, as well as across the globe. Yet what these traditionalist executives are failing to realize is that the drama, stress, and tensions caused by their demands won\u2019t matter. Mostly or fully remote work will win this winter.  That\u2019s because of the new COVID surge.\u202fIn the\u202fpast two weeks, reported cases have increased by 53 percent, and hospitalizations have risen by 31 percent.\u202f  Perhaps you think COVID vaccines might protect us from this problem? Think again.\u202f  A Kaiser Permanente study on the original Omicron strain, BA.1, found that after two doses of Pfizer, vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission was at 41% after 9 months. A booster shot increased effectiveness against hospitalization to 85% for a couple of months, but it wore off quickly to 55% after three or more months.  Note that this is vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization, not infection: the vaccine is much weaker against infection. And it\u2019s for the original Omicron strain BA.1, not BA.5, which is much more capable of immune escape, more transmissible, and causes more severe disease.\u202f  Let\u2019s not forget that less than three-quarters of eligible Americans are vaccinated, and less than half of all vaccinated Americans received a booster shot.   What about the new bivalent booster, which is more effective against BA.5? As of November 24, only 14% of those older than 18 received the new booster. And according to a just-released Morning Consult\u202fsurvey, 53% of U.S. adults say they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d get a COVID-19 booster in the next year, down from 58% who said the same in a\u202fSeptember survey.   There is a similar drop in respondents\u2019 willingness to get an annual booster: 51% said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d get annual shots in the latest survey, down from 56%.  Moreover, a new study shows that after an initial COVID infection, each subsequent infection with COVID results in higher risks of hospitalization and death.\u202f  In other words, after an initial infection, you end up with long-term or permanent damage that is exacerbated by subsequent infections. Thus, it\u2019s important to minimize the number of times we get infected with COVID.  Unfortunately, COVID isn\u2019t the only health threat running rampant. The flu and RSV have also had extraordinarily high case rates so far this season.   The implication is clear: this winter will see a major surge of infections, which has already started.  During both the Delta surge and the Omicron surge, traditionalist companies that tried to force their employees back to the office, and experienced extensive drama and stress over this coercive approach, had to roll back their plans, with all that effort wasted.\u202f  Besides, the yo-yoing of going back and forth from home to the office and back home seriously undermined productivity, harmed engagement and morale, and impaired retention and recruitment. We\u2019ll see the exact same yo-yoing at Tesla, Apple, Google, and other companies led by traditionalist executives in the next several months.\u202f  So why do they pursue this doomed effort to push their staff into the office? After all, these executives have the same information I do, and the implication is clear.  The key lies in what makes these executives feel successful and feeds their identity as leaders.\u202f  In fact, one leader wrote an op-ed piece about this topic, saying \u201cThere\u2019s a deeply personal reason why I want to go back to the office. It\u2019s selfish, but I don\u2019t care. I feel like I lost a piece of my identity in the pandemic\u2026 I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t truly find myself again if I have to work from home for the rest of my life.\u201d   By honestly saying the quiet part out loud, this op-ed reveals how other leaders use false claims about remote work undermining productivity, innovation, and social capital to try to cover up their true concerns.\u202f  This personal, selfish orientation speaks to a mental blindspot called the egocentric bias, an orientation toward prioritizing one\u2019s own perspective and worldview over others.  It is important to empathize with and understand where such leaders are coming from, but following their personal and selfish predisposition will hurt the bottom lines for their companies.\u202f  What works much better is a hybrid-first, team-led model: a flexible approach where individual team leads consult with their team members to decide what works best for them.  That goes for large companies, such as my client Applied Materials, a Fortune 200 high-tech manufacturer. It adopted an \u201cExcellence from Anywhere\u201d modality that focuses on deliverables rather than where someone works. That also goes for middle-size organizations, including another client, the Information Sciences Institute, a 400-staff data science and machine learning research center at the University of Southern California. ISI used this approach to gain leadership in hybrid and remote work.  Team members at Applied and ISI come to the office once or twice a week, whether to socialize or to collaborate more intensely, since for most people, intense collaboration works best in-person. Otherwise, team members stay at home, since workers are substantially more productive working remotely. And as cases of illness increase in their area, the teams flexibly adapt their approach to collaborate and socialize fully remotely.\u202f  A third client, the Jaeb Center for Health Research, chose to adopt a home-centric model. That\u2019s because surveys showed the large majority of its staff wanted full-time remote work. Moreover, their research-focused activities are more individualized and less team-oriented than those at ISI or Applied. They only come to the office on rare occasions for meetings or training. Such remote-first, home-centric models will work well for organizations where individual employee productivity, rather than team productivity, is more important.  In short, flexible models \u2014 while going against the intuitions of many leaders \u2014 best fit the desires of most employees, whose biggest non-salary demand is flexibility. They address the risks associated with COVID variants, flu and RSV, as well as other emergencies. And finally, they maximize profits for companies, by boosting retention, recruitment, collaboration, innovation, and productivity.   The only obstacle is the personal, selfish orientation of traditionalist leaders, who need to recognize the danger they are posing to the success of their companies if they pursue their backward-looking coercive efforts to get their staff to return to the office.  \nDr. Gleb Tsipursky helps tech and finance industry executives seize competitive advantage in hybrid work by driving employee retention, collaboration, and innovation through behavioral science as the CEO of the future-of-work consultancy Disaster Avoidance Experts, and authored the best-seller Leading Hybrid and Remote Teams: A Manual on Benchmarking to Best Practices for Competitive Advantage.

    "NASA has named 15 teams moving on to compete in the semifinal level of its Break the Ice Lunar Challenge. The $3.5 million multi-phase challenge invites problem-solvers from businesses, academia, maker communities, and more to play a role in building a lasting human presence and vibrant economy on the Moon by tapping into resources that are already there. \u201cWe\u2019re putting humanity back on the Moon with the Artemis missions, and this is a team effort on a global scale,\u201d said Amy Kaminski, program executive for Prizes, Challenges, and Cowdsourcing in NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate. \u201cChallenges like Break the Ice are one more way for creative thinkers around the world to participate, by helping us learn to \u2018live off the land\u2019 and turn local resources into useful products like water, building materials, and even rocket fuel.\u201d The second phase of competition kicked off in June with the goal of furthering development of lunar excavation and transport technologies. Level 1 challenged solvers to design a robotic system for digging and moving large quantities of icy Moon \u201cdirt,\u201d or regolith, found in the coldest, darkest places on the lunar surface. Twenty-five teams from around the world submitted entries for the first, qualifying level of Phase 2 competition. A panel of government, industry, and academic experts in in-situ resource utilization, or ISRU \u2013 the technical term for using local resources \u2013 evaluated teams\u2019 entries and selected the winners based on submissions of detailed technical reports, engineering designs, and test plans. The winning teams are: All 15 teams will move on to build and test full-size prototypes in Level 2. The 13 U.S. teams will receive equal shares of NASA\u2019s $500,000 prize purse for Level 1. NASA has announced the newest round of winners in its Break the Ice Lunar Challenge. The first level of competition challenged solvers to submit detailed engineering designs and test plans for excavating and delivering icy lunar regolith. Fifteen winning teams will move on to build and test their designs in the next level. In Level 3, qualifying teams will put their protypes to the test in a head-to-head onsite competition for a shot at $1.5 million in prizes. \u201cAs we work towards a sustained human presence on the Moon, we are committed to enabling the development and demonstration of new technologies to support the infrastructure needed for long-term human presence,\u201d said Denise Morris, acting Centennial Challenges program manager at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \u201cTechnologies and hardware from the Break the Ice Lunar Challenge will get us one step closer to excavating icy regolith on the lunar surface, providing critical water resources and excavation activities needed to build the infrastructure on the Moon.\u201d NASA\u2019s Break the Ice Lunar Challenge is a Centennial Challenge led by Marshall Space Flight Center and the agency\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

From left to right: Space studies students Shae Rackley (mission support), Alexis Lojek (commander), Sarah Guthrie, Noah Loy and Cody Ball (mission specialists) During the fall of 2022, the American Public University System Analog Research Group (AARG) completed its third space research mission. An analog mission is a terrestrial simulation designed to mimic life in space, and participants \u2013 known as analog astronaut crews \u2013 are isolated in specially constructed facilities for a predetermined period. During that time, the crews live, work and perform research as astronauts. Start a Space Studies degree at American Military University. While analog facilities cannot exactly duplicate all of the conditions of space habitats, they do provide excellent opportunities to study different aspects of the astronaut experience. For instance, they provide an environment where protocols, crew relations and important research can be performed with varying degrees of realism. For the crews, it\u2019s the chance to gain firsthand experience of the astronaut lifestyle and work as a member of space a research team. Four graduate and undergraduate students from our space studies department spent 14 days in the Inflatable Lunar-Mars Analog Habitat (ILMAH), located on the University of North Dakota (UND) campus in Grand Forks, North Dakota. This space research mission marked AARG\u2019s third time at ILMAH; it began on September 28 and ended on October 11. The four-person crew consisted of: Tyler Hines, another space studies undergraduate student, acted as the flight director for ARG-3I, with Sarah Guthrie as deputy flight director. The flight directors were responsible for mission planning and preparation. The mission motto was \u201cTercio est Leporem,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cthe third time\u2019s the charm.\u201d This motto proved to be very apt as the mission was highly successful. The ARG-3I crew had an ambitious schedule involving a wide range of research projects, focusing on extravehicular activities (EVAs), technology testing and psychology studies. Other research projects included plant growth studies and participation in research projects contributed by UND students and partners. The crew devoted a major portion of their time to a variety of EVA studies. One of the strengths of ILMAH is the availability of realistic EVA suits that the crew can use. The North Dakota Experimental 2 \u2013 Analog Trainer (NDX-2AT) suits are trainer versions of spacesuit prototypes and are weighted to simulate lunar gravity. The ARG-3I crew evaluated improvements to both the mobility and fit of the suits through a series of space research activities. They also continued the EVA communications study initiated during the ARG-2I mission. This third study aimed to improve the audio and visual communications between astronauts participating in an EVA and the intra-vehicular activity (IVA) support team. High-quality communications are vital for safety during EVAs, which are inherently risky due to increased exposure to the space environment of space, which is not supportive of life. Anytime crews venture outside the protection of their spacecraft, they are at increased risk of injury and even death. Improving communications during EVAs helps the IVA identify and mitigate these risks. Monitoring suit levels allows the IVA team to detect and prevent potential health hazards before conditions reach dangerous levels. The crew also worked with the Kinetic Utilization Resource Tool (KURT) to further investigate EVA rescue maneuvers initiated during ARG-2i. All of these studies represent important contributions to the safety of future astronauts. One of the new research studies performed during ARG-3I involved testing the technology to create oxygen through electrolysis of water. Water molecules are composed of oxygen and hydrogen atoms, both of which can be used as a fuel source. In addition to its potential for fuel, oxygen is important for life support. Water is an abundant resource in space; large amounts of water have been detected on both the moon and Mars. Off-world settlements can use this water as a source of fuel and life support if it can be effectively mined and processed on site, which would allow lunar and Martian settlements to be less reliant on Earth resources. The AARG-3I crew tested oxygen production using a small electrolysis device to investigate how different conductors and solutes affect production rates and to determine how much power was needed to produce oxygen. The data from this space research experiment provided important insights into the best environment to conduct electrolysis efficiently and sustainably. The ARG-3I crew participated in a series of continuing studies evaluating the effects of living in an isolated, confined environment (ICE). These projects are part of an ongoing AARG research initiative to better understand how the stress induced by ICE affects crew interactions and how to mitigate these effects. ICE is a serious concern for space exploration. Both spacecraft and potential surface habitats represent isolated, high-risk environments, which cause detrimental psychological effects in spacecraft crews. Analog environments, however, are ideal locations to test crew relations and stress mitigation strategies. The ARG-3I crew participated in AARG\u2019s current Facial Emotion Recognition and Mindfulness Breathing studies, extending the knowledge gained from previous missions. They also participated in a new sleep study evaluating the effects of increased levels of CO2, common in ICE, on sleep quality and mood. AARG has performed many different plant growth experiments during our time at ILMAH, thanks to the habitat\u2019s high-quality plant production module. For this mission, the crew participated in a unique study investigating the possibility of using humanure as a growth medium for a variety of vascular plants, including cucumber and sweet peppers. The ARG-3I crew also participated in several studies in collaboration with UND and its partners. These space research projects included a cardiobreath study to evaluate the importance of exercise for astronaut crew health. This study was run through a partnership between Simon Frasier University and UND, and astronauts on the International Space Station have also performed this research. Biosolids are currently used in many countries and provide a possible solution to the problem of nutrient-poor growing materials (regolith) on the Moon and Mars. During ARG-3I, the crew studied the growth of a variety of plants in simulated regolith, using humanure as a fertilizer during the mission. They also analyzed the soil samples to determine the ideal ratio for plant growth as well as the health of the plants. ARG-3I also helped maintain a plant growth study for UND and used a UND-developed time-delay system for communications, known as ECHO. Due to the distance between the Earth and Mars, communication delays between crews and terrestrial mission control can be as long as 20 minutes. If emergencies occur or astronauts need help, those delays create problems.   Testing communication best practices in analog settings helps space research participants to develop procedures and minimize the risks introduced by these delays. The crew used ECHO to simulate a 10-minute, one-way time delay in communications with mission control and noted several areas where MC/crew communications need to be improved to support mission success. They also evaluated the use of private channels supporting communications with family, which were very successful and increased crew morale. The ARG-3I mission managed a full schedule very well, successfully completing a record number of research projects during its two-week mission. They set a high standard for future missions and represented our University extremely well. Congratulations to the crew and flight directors for a successful and productive mission!

    "Welcome to OurGlobal Community of Tech Investors No two themes attract more retail investor interest than space and cannabis. Who doesn\u2019t like watching science fiction movies and taking bong rips? If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, then there\u2019s the potential for alpha on offer, provided you can stomach all the volatility. Recently, we posed the question, Just How Low Can Space Stocks Go? A lot lower, because like any disruptive technology theme, they\u2019ll move in unison with the broader technology market. With the Nasdaq sitting at nearly all-time lows, a slow slide into 2023 is all but expected. If the bear market were to reach the lows seen during the pandemic panic of March 2020, the Nasdaq would need to fall 35% from today\u2019s levels. That\u2019s why we decided to only add shares of Planet (PL) if they fall 50% or more below our cost basis. For those of you who like price targets, that would be $3.45 a share. Given the 52-week low is $3.70 a share, it\u2019s realistic to think that a continuing bear market might test those levels. Today, we want to make sure we\u2019d still pull the trigger if shares fall 50% below our cost basis or more. The latest scuttlebutt comes from Planet\u2019s Q3-2023 results released several weeks ago which also provides guidance for the remainder of 2023. What\u2019s that you say? The year 2023 hasn\u2019t even started? Shush please, and just ignore the fact that Fiscal years are confusing as hell, and whoever invented this should be taken out back and shot. The takeaway is that growth is continuing on an annual basis. Planet\u2019s glossy SPAC deck promised $191 million for Fiscal 2023, while midpoint of guidance now points to $190 million. That\u2019s indicative of a competent management team that does what they say, and also addresses problems as they arise. For example, Planet provides a metrics called \u201cwinbacks\u201d which is defined as \u201ca previously existing customer who was inactive at the start of the fiscal year, but has reactivated during the same fiscal year period.\u201d Having to convince customers to return to a solution they stopped using isn\u2019t a very big vote of confidence for the value proposition. That said, props to the management team for having the cojones to admit there was a retention problem, and actively address it with ongoing metrics. As for the most popular SaaS retention metric, net recurring revenues, that sits at 123% which is about where a typical SaaS firms ought to be.  Today\u2019s macroeconomic headwinds will make the Fiscal 2024 revenue target of $289 million \u2013 representing 50% growth year-over-year \u2013 a real challenge. Any disappointments will likely cause the share price to react accordingly, which could represent a buying opportunity. The only concern would be whether Planet can survive until they\u2019re able to start generating positive operating cash flow. Like most software-as-a\u2013service (SaaS) business models, their gross margin is expanding as they scale. With $425 million on the books and a burn rate of around $45 million a quarter, they have several years remaining before more cash will need to be raised through issuing more shares or raising debt. Overall, the company appears to be on track, and they\u2019ve even added some missing metrics that we had asked for the last time we checked in. We\u2019ve had quite the debate with readers about whether Planet Labs or Maxar (MAXR) would be the leader in geospatial imaging. We\u2019ll be losing visibility into the latter given Maxar will be acquired by private equity firm Advent. The other four companies to watch in the geospatial intelligence space are all SPACs with market caps under $1 billion (company names link to our most recent research piece on each company). We have a strict rule about not investing in any company with a market cap under $1 billion, but for those with more tolerance for risk, here\u2019s a quick look at how these geospatial intelligence companies have been faring. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $2.34 million primarily from the selling of our imagery to a single customer in an over-time revenue recognition arrangement. Evaluate companies for long enough and red flags start to become intuitive. Long shareholder updates that amount to nothing tangible, a single customer, and lots of prospects in places like Albania, are the kiss of death for companies playing follow the leader. Satellogic still hasn\u2019t managed to achieve meaningful revenues yet, and until they do, there\u2019s no point in wasting any time analyzing the company\u2019s prospects. Investors were expecting $114 million in 2022, but BlackSky\u2019s latest guidance points to just $66 million on the upper end of guidance. At least now they\u2019re managing to sell a service for more than it costs to produce. While last year their cost of goods sold (COGS) exceeded revenues, this year they\u2019ve been decreasing COGS while increasing revenues, with 82% of total revenues coming from U.S. federal government and agencies. We don\u2019t invest in companies that have such a heavy reliance on any single government because they have little leverage at the negation table. BlackSky has $88 million remaining on their books and $73 million in debt with a burn rate averaging around $35 million a year. Spire investors will be quick to point out that they\u2019re doing something different from Planet. Fine, but they\u2019re still classified under \u201cgeospatial intelligence.\u201d The company has about $100 million in cash remaining, while revenue growth is far from what investors were promised \u2013 $114 in 2022 according to the glossy SPAC deck. Here\u2019s how that\u2019s going: Full year revenue guidance remained between $80 to $82 million, after Spire lowered guidance last quarter from original 2022 guidance of between $85 million to $90 million.  Investors should hold management teams accountable for missing their estimates by a country mile. Maybe that\u2019s why the stock price has sunk like a rock. With $82 million left on the books, and $21 million burned through last quarter, Spire has about a year\u2019s worth of runway before they\u2019ll need to raise more money by selling their beaten-down shares or adding to the $100 million in debt on their books. Should the bear market continue through 2023, then companies like Spire \u2013 and even BlackSky \u2013 may see their depressed share prices lead to a risk of being demoted to over-the-counter status which would significantly inhibit their ability to raise capital. Proper institutional investors don\u2019t mess around with OTC stocks, and neither should you. Space is a risky theme, even for investors with more tolerance for risk than we have. More exposure to the theme isn\u2019t a concern given how little we have, but would we add shares of Planet were the company to fall 50% or more below our cost basis?  The company talks about this massive total addressable market of $128 billion which seems very optimistic, but even if the TAM were a 10% of that number, they\u2019ve still barely tapped into the opportunity. They claim to be the leader in geospatial intelligence, something we\u2019ve debated heavily with the Maxar advocates. Perhaps we can agree that both Maxar and Planet are leading the pack with Airbus\u2019s contributions largely an unknown apart from what industry insiders might be able to comment on.  Per our comments on \u201cwinbacks,\u201d there\u2019s a concern here about how \u201csticky\u201d the solution will be in the face of today\u2019s bear market where companies are tightening their purse strings. Does the platform add sufficient value such that customers will continue spending more through Fiscal 2024? We\u2019re optimistic given other key metrics the company provides in their recent investor deck, something we\u2019ve elaborated upon further in a YouTube video to supplement this research piece titled Best Space Stock. If we choose to add shares of Planet in the coming months, Nanalyze Premium annual subscribers will be alerted via email.  We\u2019re going to hold strictly to our rule of only adding shares if they fall 50% below our cost basis or more. Oftentimes when we set an aggressive target that seems out of reach, the market surprises us by hitting it and falling even further. If the market dumps another 20 or 30 percent in 2023, seems likely the falling tide will affect all ships. If 2023 ushers in a recovery which paves the path to the next bull market, how happy will we be? Either outcome is perfectly acceptable as we already have some exposure to what might be one of the best space stocks out there right now.  Tech investing is extremely risky.

    "Elaine Maslin is an offshore upstream and renewables focused journalist... \nDecember 30, 2022\n\n\n STL\u2019s Autonomous Synchronised Stabilised Platform being put through its paces at the University of Plymouth\u2019s COAST Laboratory. Photo courtesy STL\n With a background in subsea and offshore, coming up with new ideas is the norm\u2019 for UK-based engineering consultancy STL (Submarine Technology Limited), writes Elaine Maslin. The last few years have been no different. The company has been focusing on ship-based robotics, including robotic arms. These aren\u2019t just any robotic arms \u2013 they\u2019re motion compensated systems for deploying/recovering people and robots to and from fixed or moving objects. That could be wind technicians to an offshore wind turbine or an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in and out of the water \u2013 all with a single arm system from a vessel. In fact, STL has developed two different systems, one for moving people to locations up to 20m above the sea surface and another, an articulated system, for launch and recovery of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and AUVs, using a remote sensing system. Andreas Fechs, project and business development manager at STL, explained both systems at the joint Society of Underwater Technology (SUT), IMCA and Hydrographic Society Scotland seminar in Aberdeen in mid-November. A key goal has been to improve the safety of and ability to access offshore structures, initially fixed structures, from ships, including those that are relatively smaller than current gangway-system based vessels, he says. But another goal is to give future uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) more capability. It\u2019s been a challenge STL has been looking into since the early 2010s, when the need for better access systems became an issue, for offshore wind, but also normally unattended oil and gas facilities. While others have now commercially introduced gangway systems, STL has been developing \u201cspace stabilisation\u201d and \u201csynchronous stabilisation\u201d. Its first concept, Neptune, got going in 2012, with government R&D funding.   The Neptune a two-part articulated arm that has been designed to be able to carry 3-4 people or 1,000 tonne of equipment up to a height of 20m above the seabed and 20m reach, with +-10cm station keeping accuracy. It weighs 12-tonne, with a 2.5m x 3m foundation footprint, and is based on a steel truss structure, \u201cFor lightness and stiffness, as they have to be mounted on to relatively small vessels, but reach up to 20m high and be moved relatively quickly,\u201d explains Andreas, allowing the system to be installed on a 36m catamaran or a 54m-long monohull. All joints, the slew-ring and the gimbal base are moved with hydraulic cylinders or motors (the HPU isn\u2019t part of the 12 tonne), because of the need for speed and accuracy, using a computer control system \u2013 software and hardware at the heart of the system \u2013 that takes in the vessel\u2019s six degrees of movement (via an IMU and GNSS), including up to 3m significant wave height. The Neptune system uses dual, high speed CAN networks for rapid data transfer between sensors, controllers and actuators.  This enables full motion compensation and station keeping accuracy. The company has developed a full-scale prototype, first tested onshore in 2017, both on a six degree of freedom ship-motion simulator STL has and on land at STL\u2019s research facility in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, using real vessel motion data as input. Andreas says a vessel-based trial of this system was planned before the end of 2022.STL\u2019s Neptune during onshore trials. Photo courtesy STL Having developed Neptune, STL decided to take the concept further. Why not a multi-axis articulated arm with more intelligence, so that USVs could do more, such as equipment transfers, survey and inspection or launch and recovery operations, from a moving object, i.e. a ship or USV, to another moving object?This is the synchronous stabilisation the company has been working on, or its Autonomous Synchronised Stabilised Platform (ASSP), that\u2019s had European Regional Development Fund through the Marine-I programme in Cornwall, where the company has another base. It adds machine vision to synchronise the payload motion with the moving target, so that, whatever motion the articulated arm is experiencing, the end of the arm has no residual motion with regard to the moving (floating) object it\u2019s synchronising with. This could be used from ships for launch and recovery of ROVs and AUVs, says Andreas. Using a remote sensing system (RSS), developed by STL, and machine vision to detect robots in the water, the arm, from a host vessel, could be used to pick them out of the water, tho this would need a latching system added to the vehicles, he says.   A critical part of this system is a \u201cRemote Sensing System\u201d (RSS), which STL had further Marine-I funding to develop. The RSS adds machine vision to the robotic control system, enabling the movement of objects of interest to be tracked relative to a known datum. This is fed into the control system so the arm can synchronise with the object, such as an AUV, ROV, another vessel or a floating wind turbine, says STL. The system was initially tested in 2020 using a ship-motion simulator and a moving target test rig, and since then there\u2019s been a demonstration at the University of Plymouth\u2019s COAST Laboratory, which has in-water testing enabling physical model testing with combined waves, currents and wind. This involved a research prototype with a three-part articulated arm. It was limited to a 100kg payload, which would support deployment of a Falcon ROV or Gavia AUV, says Andreas. \u201cBut it would be applied to any robotic crane arm,\u201d says Andreas. \u201cIt could allow ship-to-ship transfer. The geometry can be adapted to any application and heavy objects.\u201d I.e. the technology can also be applied to a bigger system such as Neptune, says STL. There\u2019s still work to be done.

In most of the world, that's the equivalent of stumbling across a unicorn that's holding a few winning lottery tickets in its teeth. But that pretty much describes our top science story of 2022, the successful deployment and initial images from the Webb Telescope. In fact, there was lots of good news to come out of the world of science, with a steady flow of fascinating discoveries and tantalizing potential tech\u2014over 200 individual articles drew in 100,000 readers or more, and the topics they covered came from all areas of science. Of course, with a pandemic and climate change happening, not everything we wrote was good news. But as the top stories of the year indicate, our readers found interest in a remarkable range of topics. For better and worse, Anthony Fauci has become the public face of the pandemic response in the US. He's trusted by some for his personable, plain-spoken advice regarding how to manage the risks of infection\u2014and vilified by others for his advocacy of vaccinations (plus a handful of conspiracy theories). So, when Fauci himself ended up on the wrong end of risk management and got a SARS-CoV-2 infection, that was news as well, and our pandemic specialist, Beth Mole, was there for it. It turned out the trajectory of his infection was a metaphor for the pandemic itself, where every silver lining seems to be delivered with a few additional gray clouds. Fauci took Paxlovid, a drug that was developed due to some very rapid scientific work that involved finding out the structure of viral proteins and then identifying molecules that could fit into that structure. As a result of its design, Paxlovid rapidly and effectively suppresses the SARS-CoV-2 infections that cause COVID-19. But once again, there are those gray clouds: once the treatment course runs out, many people experience a rebound of symptoms for reasons we're still working out. And Fauci was no exception, having symptoms severe enough that he went back on the drug to shut them down again\u2014even though that's not been recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. Neutron stars are probably the most extreme objects in the Universe (black holes being more of an aberration in spacetime than an object, per se). They're places where the tallest \"mountains\" are less than a millimeter, and cracks in the crust can create violent bursts of radiation. They're also places where the interior is a superfluid of rapidly circulating subatomic particles. But in a handful of these stars, conditions get even more extreme, as any charged particles in the superfluidic interior can create a dynamo like the one in the Earth's core that creates our magnetic field. Except just a bit stronger. Well, as Paul Sutter details it, 1016 times stronger. These are the magnetars, a short-lived state of some neutron stars (they last about 10,000 years, which is short for astronomy). There are plenty of ways a neutron star can kill you, given its intense gravity and tendency to spew out lethal levels of radiation. But magnetars have an additional trick: they end chemistry. The magnetic fields are so strong that they can distort the atomic orbitals that determine how different atoms latch on to each other to form chemical bonds. Get within 1,000 kilometers or so of a magnetar, and that distortion gets so severe that the chemical bonds no longer function. All your atoms are left free to wander around as they see fit, which isn't generally conducive to life. This article was a personal rumination by Eric Berger, reflecting on the changes in NASA and the launch industry since he started covering both roughly two decades ago. For most of that time, NASA's budget has been dominated by the Space Launch System, which finally took its maiden flight this year, sending hardware to orbit the Moon and return for a flawless splashdown. In the wake of that launch, you might expect that the piece would focus on that success. Instead, Berger argued that the many failures of the program\u2014countless delays and cost overruns\u2014changed the entire launch industry, giving small companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin a chance to thrive while their entrenched competitors were focused on getting all they could out of SLS contracts. Without SLS's problems, Berger argues, the vehicles that will eventually see NASA to a successful future of crewed exploration might never have been built.

      "sequence": "Stock Analysis  A look at the shareholders of MDA Ltd. (TSE:MDA) can tell us which group is most powerful.  With 41% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company.  Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).   Following a 12% increase in the stock price last week, individual investors profited the most, but institutions who own 27% stock also stood to gain from the increase.       Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MDA, beginning with the chart below.   Check out our latest analysis for MDA   Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.   As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in MDA.  This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see MDA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.   Our data indicates that hedge funds own 11% of MDA.   That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist.

(TSE:MDA) surges 12%; individual investors who own 41% shares profited along with institutionsSimply Wall StPublished December 31, 2022Source: ShutterstockKey Insights Significant control over MDA by general public implies that this group likely has considerable sway over management and governance-related decisions The top 8 shareholders own 50% of the company  Insiders have been buying lately    A look at the shareholders of MDA Ltd. (TSE:MDA) can tell us which group is most powerful.  With 41% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company.  Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).  Following a 12% increase in the stock price last week, individual investors profited the most, but institutions who own 27% stock also stood to gain from the increase.      Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MDA, beginning with the chart below.  Check out our latest analysis for MDA TSX:MDA Ownership Breakdown December 31st 2022 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About MDA? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.   As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in MDA.  This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see MDA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

      "sequence": "Published on By Will moon mineral extraction soon be underway? The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to build a moonbase. What makes it so anxious about such a new goal? Compared to the vast universe, human beings are undoubtedly less than grains of sand. Although space exploration has been going on for more than half a century, the extraterrestrial bodies on which humans have set foot are limited to the moon, which is the closest to the earth. Moreover, only the United States of America has achieved manned moon landings and there is still a long way to go for human space exploration. At the same time, space exploration activity by the People\u2019s Republic of China has gradually expanded in recent years. Moon sampling, the Tianwen-1 space mission to the red planet, the Martian rover Zhurong and the Tiangong (Celestial Palace), a Chinese modular space station under construction, part of the fourth permanent space station programme in history (after the Saljut, Skylab, Mir and the International Space Station), all are important symbols of China\u2019s turning into a space power. However, with the progress of the Chinese space industry, NASA \u2013 which is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean \u2013 is also feeling much pressure, with its desire to initiate a plan to go back to the moon and maintain its leading position in space technology thanks to the Artemis project. Faced with pressure from Chinese moon landings and space station research, NASA has announced that it will go back to the moon in 2024. This time, with the return to the moon, the United States of America has set two main goals for itself: a new manned lunar landing; and the return to the moon to look for ways to enable humans to live permanently on the surface of our satellite and exploit it scientifically and for mining. The Artemis project aims to establish a moonbase in the meteorite crater near the satellite south pole, named after the explorer Ernest Henry Shackleton (1874-1922). This is the first task. Once the moonbase is successfully established, NASA will be able to obtain in advance the technology for the future construction of the base on Mars. Is mineral extraction part of the programme? NASA plans to build a moonbase. The peaks on the rim of Shackleton Crater are continuously exposed to sunlight, but the interior is permanently shaded. Scientists also call it the crater of eternal night. The permanent shadow inside leads to a low temperature, which has captured and frozen volatile components emitted by celestial bodies when they hit the moon. The Lunar Prospector, launched on 7 January 1998 by NASA, found a higher than normal amount of hydrogen gas in the craters during its measurement mission to the moon, indicating the presence of water ice. The Lunar Prospector, was designed for a short polar orbit analysing our satellite, mapping the surface and any polar ice deposits, measuring the magnetic field and gravity, and studying lunar events. Once the water ice extraction technology is achieved, the construction of both the moonbase and the Mars base can be greatly improved. The water ice can break down into hydrogen and oxygen, the main components of rocket fuel. In the future, the moonbase could also serve as a space service station. With a view to developing moon mining technology, NASA has also launched a competition called Break the Ice Lunar Challenge. Well-known technology companies such as Masten Space Systems, Lunar Outpost and Honeybee Robotics have currently joined the challenge. They plan to use rocket engines to design a moon mining vehicle weighing over 800 kilograms. When the moon mining vehicle reaches a site containing water ice, its engine enclosed in the dome will start up, launching the water ice-laden debris into a vacuum device that separates and stores the water ice particles. According to the plan, this moon mining vehicle is capable of mining operations from twelve craters per day. Each crater can produce about 100 kilograms of ice and more than 420,000 kilograms of lunar water ice can be recovered each year. Besides lunar water ice, the Artemis programme also includes research into the extraction of helium-3. Helium-3 (He-3) is a very valuable resource in space, and its presence on earth is rather limited. It is formed by the decay of tritium (hydrogen-3, the third isotope of the element hydrogen, after protium and deuterium). In the soil of the moon surface, there is one million tonnes of helium-3. Helium-3 can continuously supply energy to the moonbase. If the fusion energy of helium-3 is used, just 200,000 tonnes of helium-3 can enable a population of nearly one and a half billion people to use electricity for an entire year. It is also very likely that this type of space minerals will change the energy process of rockets and cause a qualitative transformation of human space technology. NASA has quickly embarked on the project to return to the moon, mainly because the satellite soil collected by the Chinese probes on the moon contains this type of future energy. NASA must also complete the technology to withstand space radiation for the Artemis project. The surface of the moon, like the surface of Mars, is not protected by an ozone layer. This is precisely the reason why space radiation there is very high. Studies have shown that space radiation can easily penetrate the bulkheads of manned spacecraft and pass through crew members\u2019 bodies. Space radiation can damage the DNA of crew members, causing a number of irreparable consequences. With a view to solving the threat of space radiation, NASA approached the research institutes of the University of Washington and Harvard University to ask for collaboration and participation in studies. In the high-tech competition, they found a very powerful small molecule. It plays an important role in repairing DNA damaged by space radiation and in restoring muscle and skeletal loss in weightlessness. This molecule is involved in the synthesis of cofactors in human cells and is a substance found in the human body and in nature. People can restore or increase the level of cellular cofactors in the body by supplementing the molecule, which is able to restore declining mitochondria and repair damaged DNA. Likewise, astronauts can also repair damaged DNA by supplementing the molecule after having been exposed to space radiation. NASA has collected a large amount of data on the radiation exposure of astronauts during space activities over the past decades. Based on this data, the Ames Research Center \u2013 one of NASA\u2019s ten largest centres, located in California\u2019s Silicon Valley at Moffett Field Airport \u2013 has developed a roadmap for radiation resistance in the human body. In the roadmap, NASA plans to use modern gene editing technology to modify astronauts\u2019 DNA so that they can adapt to the high-radiation space environment. Judging by the current level of technology, however, when we return to the moon in 2024, it is estimated that gene editing technology will not yet have reached the point where it can affect astronauts\u2019 DNA. NASA can rely on the aforementioned molecule, which will be safe and reliable only after marketing. A few years ago, some biological companies focused on studying molecules against ageing and on restoring levels to cope with mitochondrial diseases. Scientific tests and marketing have demonstrated the molecule safety, and NASA wants to use this material to complete the relevant tests on the moonbase before it can be used in large-scale space activities. The moon is the closest celestial body to the earth, and is a unique outpost for humans to improve space technology. Although it looks desolate, it contains a lot of energy that the earth does not have. Humans can probably improve aerospace technology on the moon to a higher level than on earth. It must be said, however, that if we are serious about mining or other activities on the moon, concluding relevant binding treaties is essential, and all countries carrying out space activities must be able to comply with them. In this way, the moon is protected and severe consequences are avoided for what will happen \u201cin the sky\u201d if there is conflict on earth. Psychedelic drugs, monkey brains and rescue drones to feature in cutting-edge research Advisory Board Co-chair Honoris Causa\n\nProfessor Giancarlo Elia Valori is an eminent Italian economist and businessman. He holds prestigious academic distinctions and national orders. Mr. Valori has lectured on international affairs and economics at the world\u2019s leading universities such as Peking University, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Yeshiva University in New York. \n\nHe currently chairs \u201cInternational World Group\u201d, he is also the honorary president of Huawei Italy, economic adviser to the Chinese giant HNA Group.\n\nIn 1992 he was appointed Officier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur de la R\u00e9publique Francaise, with this motivation: \u201cA man who can see across borders to understand the world\u201d and in 2002 he received the title \u201cHonorable\u201d of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de l\u2019Institut de France. \u201c Post-Cold war threats Psychedelic drugs, monkey brains and rescue drones to feature in cutting-edge research Are the Geopolitics of the Middle East changing? What\u2019s Ahead For Major Problems Like Ukraine? The Real-Life Spy Novel to Take Out Trump and Putin Sociologist sees Germany on its way to becoming a \u201cbeneficial state\u201d Published on By By Vittoria D\u2019alessio From more fresh water and less depression to life-saving drones and thought-interpreting scans, 2023 promises to be a big year in science. Still, don\u2019t expect to fly in a plane powered by electricity anytime soon. Dr Pascal Belin, a neuroscientist at the Aix-Marseille University in France and primary investigator in the EU-funded COVOPRIM project, studies humans and monkeys to understand better what happens in the brains of primates when they communicate. Scans show a remarkable similarity in the way human, marmoset and macaque brains light up when a voice is heard from another member of their species. Next year, researchers plan to implant electrodes in monkey brains to investigate this phenomenon at a nerve-cell level. The implications are far-reaching, both for people who lose the ability to speak following a brain injury or stroke and for general human interaction with technology.  \u2018Soon, we\u2019ll be able to interpret the activity of neurons in different regions of the brain very clearly. We\u2019re already understanding better and better which region does what. Soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to decode what someone is listening to simply by observing brain activity. We\u2019ll also be able to elucidate what people are imagining without their thoughts being vocalised. It\u2019s not quite the same as reading someone\u2019s thoughts \u2013 it\u2019s more about reconstructing what\u2019s going on in the brain by interpreting the activity of neurons.  \u2018In time, our new knowledge will also be used to control machines. More and more progress is already being made in this area. There will be neural implants, the kind already fitted in some epileptic patients when they don\u2019t respond to treatment, that can be strategically placed in the brain to enhance a person\u2019s perception \u2013 much like a cochlear implant is used today in thousands of deaf people so they can hear \u2013 or to send impulses that command a computer. \u2018It will mean people can express themselves without using a keyboard. A keyboard and pen are awkward crutches that have been necessary in our path towards technological innovation to allow us to convert verbal information in our brain into written words, but they won\u2019t be necessary once your computer can read that information directly from your brain. Though I\u2019m not a specialist in brain-computer interfaces, I believe this sort of innovation will be available in five to 10 years, not 40.\u2019 Tomorrow\u2019s cities will improve the safety of residents and structures alike, according to Professor Gian Paolo Cimellaro, an engineer at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy. Prof Cimellaro led the EU-funded IDEAL DRONE project to develop drones that can be deployed by firefighters to help locate people trapped in burning buildings. He believes techniques to monitor structures and rescue civilians will improve immensely in the coming years. \u2018We\u2019ll see huge change in the field of disaster resilience \u2013 both in the short- and medium-term. The advanced technologies we\u2019ve been working on mean people can be tracked inside buildings and soon we\u2019ll be able to do even better. For instance, rescue teams will wear exoskeletons \u2013 rugged suits that synchronise with their movement and give them protection and strength \u2013 so they can move heavy debris to get to survivors. \u2018Climate change will put more pressure on infrastructures, meaning disasters will happen more frequently, so we\u2019ll need to build greater resilience into all civilian infrastructure. Whenever there\u2019s a disaster, such as a partial bridge collapse, functionality drops and there\u2019s a recovery process. We\u2019ll be minimising the downtime. To stick with the bridge example, the only way to know if a bridge is safe today is through visual inspection: the engineer looks at the deck and decides whether or not to replace a part. But soon, sensors will become cheaper and bridges will be covered in them. These will report back on levels of ageing. That way, when a problem is detected, it can be fixed before it becomes a crisis. \u2018Eventually, we\u2019ll have \u2018\u2018super artificial intelligence\u2019\u2019, where a machine is smarter than the engineer and can inspect a structure and perform actions better than any human. For very long bridges, inspection will be done by drones equipped with robots that will collect multiple sets of information at the same time using high-resolution cameras, thermal cameras and laser scanners.\u2019 Psychedelic drugs, when paired with specialist psychotherapy, show great promise as treatments for chronic, tricky mental illnesses. Scientists in Europe and the US including Dr Claudia Schwarz-Plaschg are unravelling the neuroscience of psychedelic \u2018trips\u2019, hoping to bring an end to debilitating conditions like depression and trauma. Dr Schwarz-Plaschg completed the EU-funded ReMedPsy project in which she examined society\u2019s evolving views on these substances. \u2018I envisage research into the benefits of psychedelics moving beyond mental-health issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction to include any condition where mind and body are integrated \u2013 from autism and dementia to obesity and pain disorders. I also anticipate more research into how psychedelics can enhance creativity and help with problem solving, as these substances are known to foster shifts in perspective. \u2018In terms of risks, we also need more studies into the adverse effects of psychedelics. Bad trips happen and can be very destabilising. I expect we\u2019ll see the broader conversation on drug decriminalisation and legalisation move forward in the next few years, and this will include psychedelics. \u2018I also anticipate more research into the spiritual and religious benefits of these substances. We\u2019re undergoing a spiritual crisis in western society. Psychedelics could play a role in helping people find deeper meaning in life again. I hope 2023 will enable me and other critical scholars to scrutinise how knowledge is created in this field. What impact does psychedelic research have on communities that have been using psychedelics for much longer than Western science? Are we extracting knowledge from Indigenous and underground communities without giving back?\u2019 Because air travel contributes to global warming, European researchers are exploring the potential of electric and hybrid engines to reduce jets\u2019 carbon footprint. With today\u2019s batteries still some way from being ready for commercial use, Fabio Russo, head of research at Italian aircraft maker Tecnam and coordinator of the EU-funded H3PS project, says real progress requires airlines to make tangible commitments. \u2018Our company is putting resources and engineering into developing new technologies for both all-electric and hybrid aircraft. However, all-electric batteries work only in light aircraft with a flying time of around 20 or 30 minutes plus reserve, so clearly that\u2019s unlikely to work for people wanting to fly even short-haul in commercial airliners. \u2018Why are things not moving as fast as we\u2019d like? Because, even though we see lots of press releases from airlines expressing their intention to be on a sustainable path, only rarely something tangible then happens. There is no progressive business model, no meaningful commitments when it comes to making pledges about purchases of cleaner aircraft. This does not help manufacturers to safely unlock huge investments. And this needs to change or else engineers, manufacturers and airlines will jeopardise their credibility. \u2018Currently, a battery can no longer be used in aircraft once its performance drops below 90% because, at this point, the flight range becomes severely compromised and there\u2019s an increased risk of the battery overheating. This means that after around 800 flight cycles \u2013 typically a few weeks of flying \u2013 the battery needs to be removed and a new one bought for likely many thousands of euros. And that\u2019s just for a nine-passenger aircraft with very low range. This is too costly to make business sense, plus it\u2019s environmentally wasteful. Over the next few years, I hope we find ways to make batteries last longer and allow them to be \u201coverhauled\u201d, meaning the airline would give its battery back to the manufacturer and get another with new cells. The old battery would then be sold to power other machines like consumer electronics or those used for energy storage.\u2019 Fresh-water supplies are diminishing around the world. As populations grow and droughts worsen, scientists are seeking new ways to convert high-saline water (as exists in oceans) into a form that can be piped into homes and industry. George Brik is chief executive officer of Hydro Volta, a Belgium-based company with a patented desalination technology. Developed in the EU-funded SonixED project, the technology is a lot greener than anything used today, requiring far less energy and fewer chemicals. \u2018The world has an unlimited supply of seawater but it\u2019s wasteful, expensive and harsh on the environment to desalinate water using traditional techniques. This is where Hydro Volta can help. Our technology makes the conversion of seawater to fresh water both cheaper and safer for the environment. All that\u2019s left is for us to scale up our processes and get the message across to governments and industry that we can help them solve an important and growing problem. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll get this opportunity over the next few years. \u2018I came to Belgium with my family as a survivor of the Syrian war 10 years ago. I was already working in the water-treatment industry in Syria, but I had to leave everything behind and start from scratch when I moved to Belgium, which was very difficult. \u2018But two years after arriving, I met a man named Yousef Yousef who became my business partner and co-founder and, from the start, the Flemish government and the EU have believed in our project and supported us. I\u2019m so thankful for the opportunity I have been given. Now all that\u2019s left is for us to be get the chance to take our technology out into the world.\u2019 This article was originally published\u202fin Horizon, the EU Research and Innovation Magazine.    Published on By Since the Covid19 outbreak and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, many industrialised and developing nations have understood the significance of supply chains and the risks they provide. This has been seen in the situations of numerous items, such as food and oil, whose supply was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war; it is now especially evident in the case of semiconductors. Every nation, whether developed or developing, requires semiconductors since they are utilised in every electronic device and in a range of areas, including medical, healthcare, defence, renewable energy initiatives, and a number of upcoming projects, such as quantum computing. The leaders in the semiconductors race on the worldwide market are the United States, whose 2020 market share was valued at over $200 billion. The United States has been a pioneer in the export of semiconductors, commanding about 50 percent of the worldwide market. Semiconductors are one of the top export goods of the United States. Additionally, the United States invests more than one-fifth of their sales on research and development, placing them second only to the pharmaceutical business. China is another nation that is emerging as a major participant in the semiconductor race, since it has been making rapid progress in this arena. China\u2019s semiconductor industry has been growing since 2015, when it accounted for only 3.8% of the global supply race. However, in the last 5 years, China\u2019s semiconductor industry has grown from a mere $!3billion in 2015 to an annual growth rate of $40 billion market industry, and China now stands 1% behind Europe and Japan in the semiconductor race, as China\u2019s semiconductor industry accounts for 9% today and the Europe\u2019s and Japan\u2019s annual percentage growth rates are 2% and 3%, respectively. China has already eclipsed Taiwan in the semiconductor business during the previous two years. If China\u2019s semiconductor industry continues to develop at the same rate, its annual sales might reach $114 billion by 2024, placing it just behind the United States and South Korea. India\u2019s future with Semiconductors India\u2019s current semiconductor facilities are the Gallium Arsenide Enabling Technology Centre (GAETEC) and the Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL), but all this could change as India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed at the Indian Mobile Congress, which helped in highlighting India\u2019s scope and ambitions with the future technology which India t is developing. The government has begun to recognise the importance of semiconductors and how a domestic semiconductor industry could enable India to reduce its dependence on the giants of the Semiconductor industry and increase the \u2018Atmanhirbar Plan\u2019 of India. The Prime Minister of India aspires to make India a leader in cutting-edge technology, and semiconductors are a key component in achieving this objective. The United States has long sought to isolate its essential technology supply chains from China; India can provide an assist in this endeavour. In this cooperation, India is projected to contribute a total of $20 billion, which may help India become a superpower and compete with nations like China and European markets in the chip race. Many countries, not just the United States, are adopting a \u201cChina Plus One\u201d strategy to reduce their reliance on China and shift their markets to \u201clike-minded countries\u201d such as India. Many private companies, such as Tata and Adana, have also pledged multi-million dollar investments in this project, which can help India\u2019s semiconductor industry grow at a projected rate of $64 billion by 2026, representing a 19% annual growth rate. As India has been relatively weak in this sector, as India\u2019s imports of semiconductors inputs reached $21 billion in 2019 and that figure has been rising rapidly each year, the recent semiconductor manufacturing incentives offered by the government of India will also help the Indian economy as many American companies will expand their capacities in India and this will help in building the right supply chains worldwide and this will also help industries in India. This will also contribute to the growth of the Indian economy. Conclusion While all of this is true and will help India in the long run and increase its presence on the global market, India must not forget that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. India must also keep in mind that chip manufacturing requires a great deal of raw materials and that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. The India-United States cooperation cannot be viewed as restrictive to any particular field, and with the rapidly changing geopolitical situation, it is important to remember that China, which is a producer of electronics, is also a consumer, and that one must observe how the semiconductor and high-end chip industries continue and how demand develops. Published on By In December 2022, the International Center for Social and Political Studies and Consulting published the second report \u201cExperts on the Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to International Psychological Security\u201d, penned by this author. This report stems from the research project titled \u201cMalicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to Psychological Security in Northeast Asia\u201d (21-514-92001) and jointly funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) and the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences (VASS). The responses garnered from a targeted survey of twenty-five experts from twelve countries and the subsequent analysis of their feedback aim to bring to light the most serious threats to international information-psychological security (IPS) through malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI), determining how dangerous these threats are, which measures should be used to neutralize them, and identifying the prospects for international cooperation in this area. This publication attempts to define the current level of MUAI threat to the IPS as well as its possible level by 2030. The report pays special attention to the situation in Northeast Asia (NEA), where MUAI practices are based on a combination of a high level of AI technologies in leading countries and a complex of acute contradictions in the region. The results of the second survey allow us to trace the continuity and changes in expert assessments compared to the first survey conducted a year earlier, in which nineteen experts from ten countries took part. In the year since the first expert survey, the world has become even more unstable and dangerous. NATO\u2019s aggressive advance to the East provoked a massive military conflict in Ukraine, one that risks escalating into a world war. Gross domestic product in Ukraine is expected to decline 35 to 40 percent in 2022; Russia also expects a decline of 2,5 percent for the same period. There are clear signs of a recession in the U.S. and the EU, with this economic slowdown reaching even China. Unprecedented inflation, rising borrowing costs, and increasingly intimidating levels of indebtedness are all contributing to fears of economic collapse in many Western and non-Western countries. However, even amid COVID-19, the ultra-rich have little to worry about. In 2022, Forbes identified more than 1,000 billionaires around the world who were richer than they were a year prior (Dolan and Peterson-Withorn, 2022). This deepening polarization in living standards inevitably intensifies the world\u2019s most acute political, racial, and national conflicts across both developing and rich countries\u2014including the United States, long thought immune to such turmoil. In a sick society, threats to psychological security through the malicious use of AI are much higher than in a socially healthy environment. Especially if social regression is observed against the background of the ongoing progress of high technologies. The transition to advanced forms of AI is already happening. In 2022, DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet specializing in AI, announced the creation of an intelligent agent called \u201cGato\u201d that can single-handedly perform more than 600 of different tasks (MSN, 2022). The same network, with the same weights, can play Atari video games, capture images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more. Gato decides whether to produce text, torque joints, press buttons or take other actions based on context (DeepMind, 2022). The agent could outperform human experts in 450 tasks. Gato learns several different tasks at the same time, easily switching from one skill to another without forgetting what it has learned. Previous AI models have started to combine different skills but when starting a new task, these models had to forget what was previously learned in order to move on to the next one. However, Gato does make some mistakes that a human would not make. While Gato is still far from being an AGI creation, progress is still evident. In terms of malicious use, an agent similar to Gato repeatedly, if not by orders of magnitude, reduces the cost of preparing and implementing various actions by one agent. This makes it easier to carry out psychological operations with a combined effect on the senses\u2014an intelligent agent like Gato can simultaneously send text messages, conduct a conversation and so on. Modern AI capabilities already enable one to influence public consciousness. The president-elect of South Korea, Yoon Suk-yeol, used an unusual strategy during his 2022 election campaign. His campaign team used deepfakes to make an \u201cAI avatar\u201d that helped him win the election. This technology is helpful for appealing to younger voters and to get them more involved (Vastmindz 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s creators believe he is the world\u2019s first official deepfake candidate\u2014a concept that is gaining traction in South Korea, which has the world\u2019s fastest average internet speeds (AFP 2022). AI technology transformed Yoon Suk-yeol into a more modern candidate than his competitors from the perspective of younger voters. With neatly combed, black hair and a smart suit, the avatar looks nearly identical to the real candidate but instead, used salty language and meme-ready quips in a bid to engage younger voters who get their news online (AFPRelaxnews 2022). Some alarms were raised when the avatar politician used humor to try and deflect attention from Yoon\u2019s past scandals (The Times of India 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s pronouncements made headlines in the South Korean media, and seven million people visited the \u201cWiki Yoon\u201d website to question the avatar (AFP 2022). At first glance, AI Yoon could pass for an actual candidate\u2014an apt demonstration of how far artificially generated videos have come in the last few years. \u201cWords that are often spoken by Yoon are better reflected in AI Yoon,\u201d said Baik Kyeong-hoon, director of the AI Yoon team (AFP 2022). However, there is a question about what should be done if the avatar of a statesman, politician or business person is a false representation, reinforcing in the public\u2019s conscious and subconscious mind inflated qualities, creating the illusion of attributes that the real person does not possess. The experience of South Korea\u2019s last presidential campaign may have shown, in part, the initial form of a new method of rather dangerous political manipulation. An increasingly adaptive avatar that does not need rest creates an image that a real person will be able to compete with less and less in the public space. This prompts the question of whether \u201ctelevised presidents\u201d will soon be replaced by \u201cdeepfake presidents\u201d? The world\u2019s first AI TV news anchor was unveiled in China in 2018 (Kuo, 2018), and they were immediately noticeable as the result of an algorithm. However, in December 2021, AI company Xiaoice introduced N Xiaohei and N Xiaobai\u2014virtual replicas of two real-life news anchors\u2014on \u201cAI Business Daily.\u201d According to the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, Xiaoice, in collaboration with National Business Daily, has demonstrated a strong ability to develop virtual replicas that are effectively indistinguishable from real humans through advanced machine learning (ML) and rendering technologies (Lin, 2022). Unfortunately, these extraordinary achievements have the potential to be used for malicious purposes by anti-social actors aiming to destabilize the public consciousness, provoke anti-social actions, and/or deceive individuals. Notably, this risk is not purely theoretical, with deepfakes having been used on several occasions to trick companies into sending money by them (Statt, 2019; Stupp, 2019; Veldkamp, 2022). Of course, this practice is not yet common, meaning that the risk is fairly minor\u2014for now. In June 2022, the FBI warned that scammers are beginning to use deepfakes to apple for sensitive jobs; this type of fraud could be used to gain access to company networks and obtain company data (Ferraro and Chipman, 2022). AI technologies are being tested in military conflicts, including psychological warfare. The use of Western-produced AI technologies in the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is significant. US facial recognition startup Clearview AI has provided technical support to Ukraine. Clearview AI\u2019s tools can identify faces in videos, comparing them to a company database of 20 billion images from public networks, identifying potential spies and people who have been killed. AI tools also play an important role in Ukraine\u2019s propaganda war and in processing critical conflict information. A program from the US company Primer can perform speech recognition, transcription and translation that captures and analyzes Russian information, including conversations between Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The Swiss encrypted chat service called Threema allows Ukrainian users to send this data to the military without revealing their identities. According to former Google chief executive officer Eric Schmidt, now an AI adviser to the US government, the Ukrainian military receives thousands of such reports every day, which are then filtered by an AI program (Global Times, 2022). Russia has not been slow to respond. The Russian Federation\u2019s Ministry of Defense Office for the Development of Artificial Intelligence conducted an examination of the innovative projects to be presented at the Army 2022 Forum for AI technology use (IMTF \u201cArmy\u20132022,\u201d 2022). Vasily Elistratov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s Department for the Development of AI Technologies, said that special military operation experience in Ukraine is used to improve weapons systems (Ixbt.com, 2022). Unfortunately, the arms race that is growing in terms of both size and participation, not least in the field of AI, is making international security, including its psychological component, less and less durable. The potential for MUAI today is astounding. Noting this, researchers from Collaborations Pharmaceuticals in cooperation with European scientific institutions conducted a conceptual experiment. Instead of synthesizing new drugs, they asked the opposite of the MegaSyn AI neural network: to identify substances that are the most toxic to the human body. The neural network correctly understood the task and, in under six hours, generated a list of 40,000 substances that are optimal components of chemical and biological weapons. The AI independently designed not only many known chemical warfare agents, but also many new ones that are more toxic. This simple inversion of the ML model turned a harmless generative model from a useful tool into an enabler of mass murder (Urbina et al., 2022). It is reasonable to suspect that this inversion approach could be applied to other areas, such as finding optimal ways to have negative psychological impacts on the public consciousness. The most worrisome aspect of these mounting concerns is simple: legislative responses are lagging behind. The sluggish speed of the legislative process (especially relative to that of the MUAI-development process) is clear in the fact that, for example, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, at the time of writing this text, has not yet passed the first reading in the European Parliament (EUR-Lex, 2022). In analyzing the current international situation, most studies focus on economic, military, and geopolitical changes without sufficiently linking them to the growing impact of qualitative technological changes on international dynamics, including those in the sphere of psychological security. This underestimation is clear in the near-complete lack in the literature of a systemic analysis of the possible risks of MUAI to psychological security at individual, group, national, and international levels. The absence of such an analysis is unacceptable for numerous reasons. First, the penetration of modern AI into countless spheres of life makes it a critical component of continued development and progress. Investment in AI may consist of trillions of dollars within the next two decades. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers Middle East (PwC) report released at the World Government Summit in Dubai, 14 per cent (U.S. $15.7 trillion) of global economic growth will stem from the use of AI by 2030. PwC believes that the greatest gains in 2030 will be in China, where AI will be responsible for up to 26 percent of economic growth (Rao and Verweij, 2018, p. 3). However, as already established, alongside AI\u2019s development will come tremendous risks, including in the field of psychological security. Second, there is already some research into international practices of MUAI in the psychological field. It is short-sighted not to continue existing research on a systemic interdisciplinary basis, taking into account the counter progress of AI technologies and the regression of existing public structures, national and international institutions, and simply wait until the consequences of AI become an even greater threat to international security. At the same time, strong support from state and non-state actors is required for such research that goes beyond such areas as cybersecurity and information security, as well as psychological security before the introduction of AI technologies, because we are talking about qualitatively different possibilities of causing irreparable damage to the development of human civilization than simply quantitative expansion of propaganda capabilities. Third, the international situation is continually worsening in several respects. This is not because of particular politicians being in power but because of the severity of the problems faced during the transition to a qualitatively new stage in human development. This transition has been accompanied by an increase in economic problems, socio-political tensions, and geopolitical competition. AI can become both the technological foundation of a new, more socially oriented world order, and the tool of high-tech undemocratic dictatorships, actively used for antisocial purposes by various non-state actors. The conducted expert survey and the subsequent analysis of its results are precisely intended to fill the gap in the awareness of the nature and scope of threats to society associated with modern and future MUAI practices in the context of the global crisis, as well as an assessment of possible risks in this area in the near future. Further research in this direction obviously follows from the nature and dynamics of the changes taking place in the world.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to build a moonbase. What makes it so anxious about such a new goal?\nCompared to the vast universe, human beings are undoubtedly less than grains of sand. Although space exploration has been going on for more than half a century, the extraterrestrial bodies on which humans have set foot are limited to the moon, which is the closest to the earth. Moreover, only the United States of America has achieved manned moon landings and there is still a long way to go for human space exploration.\nAt the same time, space exploration activity by the People\u2019s Republic of China has gradually expanded in recent years. Moon sampling, the Tianwen-1 space mission to the red planet, the Martian rover Zhurong and the Tiangong (Celestial Palace), a Chinese modular space station under construction, part of the fourth permanent space station programme in history (after the Saljut, Skylab, Mir and the International Space Station), all are important symbols of China\u2019s turning into a space power.\nHowever, with the progress of the Chinese space industry, NASA \u2013 which is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean \u2013 is also feeling much pressure, with its desire to initiate a plan to go back to the moon and maintain its leading position in space technology thanks to the Artemis project.\nFaced with pressure from Chinese moon landings and space station research, NASA has announced that it will go back to the moon in 2024. This time, with the return to the moon, the United States of America has set two main goals for itself: a new manned lunar landing; and the return to the moon to look for ways to enable humans to live permanently on the surface of our satellite and exploit it scientifically and for mining.\nThe Artemis project aims to establish a moonbase in the meteorite crater near the satellite south pole, named after the explorer Ernest Henry Shackleton (1874-1922). This is the first task. Once the moonbase is successfully established, NASA will be able to obtain in advance the technology for the future construction of the base on Mars.\nIs mineral extraction part of the programme? NASA plans to build a moonbase. The peaks on the rim of Shackleton Crater are continuously exposed to sunlight, but the interior is permanently shaded. Scientists also call it the crater of eternal night. The permanent shadow inside leads to a low temperature, which has captured and frozen volatile components emitted by celestial bodies when they hit the moon. The Lunar Prospector, launched on 7 January 1998 by NASA, found a higher than normal amount of hydrogen gas in the craters during its measurement mission to the moon, indicating the presence of water ice. The Lunar Prospector, was designed for a short polar orbit analysing our satellite, mapping the surface and any polar ice deposits, measuring the magnetic field and gravity, and studying lunar events.\nOnce the water ice extraction technology is achieved, the construction of both the moonbase and the Mars base can be greatly improved. The water ice can break down into hydrogen and oxygen, the main components of rocket fuel. In the future, the moonbase could also serve as a space service station.\nWith a view to developing moon mining technology, NASA has also launched a competition called Break the Ice Lunar Challenge. Well-known technology companies such as Masten Space Systems, Lunar Outpost and Honeybee Robotics have currently joined the challenge.\nThey plan to use rocket engines to design a moon mining vehicle weighing over 800 kilograms. When the moon mining vehicle reaches a site containing water ice, its engine enclosed in the dome will start up, launching the water ice-laden debris into a vacuum device that separates and stores the water ice particles.\nAccording to the plan, this moon mining vehicle is capable of mining operations from twelve craters per day. Each crater can produce about 100 kilograms of ice and more than 420,000 kilograms of lunar water ice can be recovered each year.\nBesides lunar water ice, the Artemis programme also includes research into the extraction of helium-3. Helium-3 (He-3) is a very valuable resource in space, and its presence on earth is rather limited. It is formed by the decay of tritium (hydrogen-3, the third isotope of the element hydrogen, after protium and deuterium). In the soil of the moon surface, there is one million tonnes of helium-3.\nHelium-3 can continuously supply energy to the moonbase. If the fusion energy of helium-3 is used, just 200,000 tonnes of helium-3 can enable a population of nearly one and a half billion people to use electricity for an entire year. It is also very likely that this type of space minerals will change the energy process of rockets and cause a qualitative transformation of human space technology.\nNASA has quickly embarked on the project to return to the moon, mainly because the satellite soil collected by the Chinese probes on the moon contains this type of future energy.\nNASA must also complete the technology to withstand space radiation for the Artemis project. The surface of the moon, like the surface of Mars, is not protected by an ozone layer. This is precisely the reason why space radiation there is very high. Studies have shown that space radiation can easily penetrate the bulkheads of manned spacecraft and pass through crew members\u2019 bodies. Space radiation can damage the DNA of crew members, causing a number of irreparable consequences.\nWith a view to solving the threat of space radiation, NASA approached the research institutes of the University of Washington and Harvard University to ask for collaboration and participation in studies. In the high-tech competition, they found a very powerful small molecule. It plays an important role in repairing DNA damaged by space radiation and in restoring muscle and skeletal loss in weightlessness.\nThis molecule is involved in the synthesis of cofactors in human cells and is a substance found in the human body and in nature. People can restore or increase the level of cellular cofactors in the body by supplementing the molecule, which is able to restore declining mitochondria and repair damaged DNA. Likewise, astronauts can also repair damaged DNA by supplementing the molecule after having been exposed to space radiation.\nNASA has collected a large amount of data on the radiation exposure of astronauts during space activities over the past decades. Based on this data, the Ames Research Center \u2013 one of NASA\u2019s ten largest centres, located in California\u2019s Silicon Valley at Moffett Field Airport \u2013 has developed a roadmap for radiation resistance in the human body. In the roadmap, NASA plans to use modern gene editing technology to modify astronauts\u2019 DNA so that they can adapt to the high-radiation space environment.\nJudging by the current level of technology, however, when we return to the moon in 2024, it is estimated that gene editing technology will not yet have reached the point where it can affect astronauts\u2019 DNA. NASA can rely on the aforementioned molecule, which will be safe and reliable only after marketing. A few years ago, some biological companies focused on studying molecules against ageing and on restoring levels to cope with mitochondrial diseases.\nScientific tests and marketing have demonstrated the molecule safety, and NASA wants to use this material to complete the relevant tests on the moonbase before it can be used in large-scale space activities.\nThe moon is the closest celestial body to the earth, and is a unique outpost for humans to improve space technology. Although it looks desolate, it contains a lot of energy that the earth does not have. Humans can probably improve aerospace technology on the moon to a higher level than on earth.\nIt must be said, however, that if we are serious about mining or other activities on the moon, concluding relevant binding treaties is essential, and all countries carrying out space activities must be able to comply with them.

Still, don\u2019t expect to fly in a plane powered by electricity anytime soon.\nDr Pascal Belin, a neuroscientist at the Aix-Marseille University in France and primary investigator in the EU-funded COVOPRIM project, studies humans and monkeys to understand better what happens in the brains of primates when they communicate. Scans show a remarkable similarity in the way human, marmoset and macaque brains light up when a voice is heard from another member of their species. Next year, researchers plan to implant electrodes in monkey brains to investigate this phenomenon at a nerve-cell level. The implications are far-reaching, both for people who lose the ability to speak following a brain injury or stroke and for general human interaction with technology. \n\u2018Soon, we\u2019ll be able to interpret the activity of neurons in different regions of the brain very clearly. We\u2019re already understanding better and better which region does what. Soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to decode what someone is listening to simply by observing brain activity. We\u2019ll also be able to elucidate what people are imagining without their thoughts being vocalised. It\u2019s not quite the same as reading someone\u2019s thoughts \u2013 it\u2019s more about reconstructing what\u2019s going on in the brain by interpreting the activity of neurons. \n\u2018In time, our new knowledge will also be used to control machines. More and more progress is already being made in this area. There will be neural implants, the kind already fitted in some epileptic patients when they don\u2019t respond to treatment, that can be strategically placed in the brain to enhance a person\u2019s perception \u2013 much like a cochlear implant is used today in thousands of deaf people so they can hear \u2013 or to send impulses that command a computer.\n\u2018It will mean people can express themselves without using a keyboard. A keyboard and pen are awkward crutches that have been necessary in our path towards technological innovation to allow us to convert verbal information in our brain into written words, but they won\u2019t be necessary once your computer can read that information directly from your brain. Though I\u2019m not a specialist in brain-computer interfaces, I believe this sort of innovation will be available in five to 10 years, not 40.\u2019\nTomorrow\u2019s cities will improve the safety of residents and structures alike, according to Professor Gian Paolo Cimellaro, an engineer at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy. Prof Cimellaro led the EU-funded IDEAL DRONE project to develop drones that can be deployed by firefighters to help locate people trapped in burning buildings. He believes techniques to monitor structures and rescue civilians will improve immensely in the coming years.\n\u2018We\u2019ll see huge change in the field of disaster resilience \u2013 both in the short- and medium-term. The advanced technologies we\u2019ve been working on mean people can be tracked inside buildings and soon we\u2019ll be able to do even better. For instance, rescue teams will wear exoskeletons \u2013 rugged suits that synchronise with their movement and give them protection and strength \u2013 so they can move heavy debris to get to survivors.\n\u2018Climate change will put more pressure on infrastructures, meaning disasters will happen more frequently, so we\u2019ll need to build greater resilience into all civilian infrastructure. Whenever there\u2019s a disaster, such as a partial bridge collapse, functionality drops and there\u2019s a recovery process. We\u2019ll be minimising the downtime. To stick with the bridge example, the only way to know if a bridge is safe today is through visual inspection: the engineer looks at the deck and decides whether or not to replace a part. But soon, sensors will become cheaper and bridges will be covered in them. These will report back on levels of ageing. That way, when a problem is detected, it can be fixed before it becomes a crisis.\n\u2018Eventually, we\u2019ll have \u2018\u2018super artificial intelligence\u2019\u2019, where a machine is smarter than the engineer and can inspect a structure and perform actions better than any human. For very long bridges, inspection will be done by drones equipped with robots that will collect multiple sets of information at the same time using high-resolution cameras, thermal cameras and laser scanners.\u2019\nPsychedelic drugs, when paired with specialist psychotherapy, show great promise as treatments for chronic, tricky mental illnesses. Scientists in Europe and the US including Dr Claudia Schwarz-Plaschg are unravelling the neuroscience of psychedelic \u2018trips\u2019, hoping to bring an end to debilitating conditions like depression and trauma. Dr Schwarz-Plaschg completed the EU-funded ReMedPsy project in which she examined society\u2019s evolving views on these substances.\n\u2018I envisage research into the benefits of psychedelics moving beyond mental-health issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction to include any condition where mind and body are integrated \u2013 from autism and dementia to obesity and pain disorders. I also anticipate more research into how psychedelics can enhance creativity and help with problem solving, as these substances are known to foster shifts in perspective.\n\u2018In terms of risks, we also need more studies into the adverse effects of psychedelics. Bad trips happen and can be very destabilising. I expect we\u2019ll see the broader conversation on drug decriminalisation and legalisation move forward in the next few years, and this will include psychedelics.\n\u2018I also anticipate more research into the spiritual and religious benefits of these substances. We\u2019re undergoing a spiritual crisis in western society. Psychedelics could play a role in helping people find deeper meaning in life again. I hope 2023 will enable me and other critical scholars to scrutinise how knowledge is created in this field. What impact does psychedelic research have on communities that have been using psychedelics for much longer than Western science? Are we extracting knowledge from Indigenous and underground communities without giving back?\u2019\nBecause air travel contributes to global warming, European researchers are exploring the potential of electric and hybrid engines to reduce jets\u2019 carbon footprint. With today\u2019s batteries still some way from being ready for commercial use, Fabio Russo, head of research at Italian aircraft maker Tecnam and coordinator of the EU-funded H3PS project, says real progress requires airlines to make tangible commitments.\n\u2018Our company is putting resources and engineering into developing new technologies for both all-electric and hybrid aircraft. However, all-electric batteries work only in light aircraft with a flying time of around 20 or 30 minutes plus reserve, so clearly that\u2019s unlikely to work for people wanting to fly even short-haul in commercial airliners.\n\u2018Why are things not moving as fast as we\u2019d like? Because, even though we see lots of press releases from airlines expressing their intention to be on a sustainable path, only rarely something tangible then happens. There is no progressive business model, no meaningful commitments when it comes to making pledges about purchases of cleaner aircraft. This does not help manufacturers to safely unlock huge investments. And this needs to change or else engineers, manufacturers and airlines will jeopardise their credibility.\n\u2018Currently, a battery can no longer be used in aircraft once its performance drops below 90% because, at this point, the flight range becomes severely compromised and there\u2019s an increased risk of the battery overheating. This means that after around 800 flight cycles \u2013 typically a few weeks of flying \u2013 the battery needs to be removed and a new one bought for likely many thousands of euros. And that\u2019s just for a nine-passenger aircraft with very low range. This is too costly to make business sense, plus it\u2019s environmentally wasteful. Over the next few years, I hope we find ways to make batteries last longer and allow them to be \u201coverhauled\u201d, meaning the airline would give its battery back to the manufacturer and get another with new cells. The old battery would then be sold to power other machines like consumer electronics or those used for energy storage.\u2019\nFresh-water supplies are diminishing around the world. As populations grow and droughts worsen, scientists are seeking new ways to convert high-saline water (as exists in oceans) into a form that can be piped into homes and industry. George Brik is chief executive officer of Hydro Volta, a Belgium-based company with a patented desalination technology. Developed in the EU-funded SonixED project, the technology is a lot greener than anything used today, requiring far less energy and fewer chemicals.\n\u2018The world has an unlimited supply of seawater but it\u2019s wasteful, expensive and harsh on the environment to desalinate water using traditional techniques. This is where Hydro Volta can help. Our technology makes the conversion of seawater to fresh water both cheaper and safer for the environment. All that\u2019s left is for us to scale up our processes and get the message across to governments and industry that we can help them solve an important and growing problem. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll get this opportunity over the next few years.\n\u2018I came to Belgium with my family as a survivor of the Syrian war 10 years ago. I was already working in the water-treatment industry in Syria, but I had to leave everything behind and start from scratch when I moved to Belgium, which was very difficult.\n\u2018But two years after arriving, I met a man named Yousef Yousef who became my business partner and co-founder and, from the start, the Flemish government and the EU have believed in our project and supported us. I\u2019m so thankful for the opportunity I have been given. Now all that\u2019s left is for us to be get the chance to take our technology out into the world.\u2019\nThis article was originally published\u202fin Horizon, the EU Research and Innovation Magazine.   \nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Technology\nThe Semiconductor Industry and its future\n\n\n \n\n\nPublished 6 days ago on December 25, 2022\n\n\nBy Anuj Dhyani \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSince the Covid19 outbreak and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, many industrialised and developing nations have understood the significance of supply chains and the risks they provide. This has been seen in the situations of numerous items, such as food and oil, whose supply was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war; it is now especially evident in the case of semiconductors.\nEvery nation, whether developed or developing, requires semiconductors since they are utilised in every electronic device and in a range of areas, including medical, healthcare, defence, renewable energy initiatives, and a number of upcoming projects, such as quantum computing. The leaders in the semiconductors race on the worldwide market are the United States, whose 2020 market share was valued at over $200 billion. The United States has been a pioneer in the export of semiconductors, commanding about 50 percent of the worldwide market. Semiconductors are one of the top export goods of the United States. Additionally, the United States invests more than one-fifth of their sales on research and development, placing them second only to the pharmaceutical business. China is another nation that is emerging as a major participant in the semiconductor race, since it has been making rapid progress in this arena. China\u2019s semiconductor industry has been growing since 2015, when it accounted for only 3.8% of the global supply race. However, in the last 5 years, China\u2019s semiconductor industry has grown from a mere $!3billion in 2015 to an annual growth rate of $40 billion market industry, and China now stands 1% behind Europe and Japan in the semiconductor race, as China\u2019s semiconductor industry accounts for 9% today and the Europe\u2019s and Japan\u2019s annual percentage growth rates are 2% and 3%, respectively. China has already eclipsed Taiwan in the semiconductor business during the previous two years. If China\u2019s semiconductor industry continues to develop at the same rate, its annual sales might reach $114 billion by 2024, placing it just behind the United States and South Korea.\nIndia\u2019s future with Semiconductors\nIndia\u2019s current semiconductor facilities are the Gallium Arsenide Enabling Technology Centre (GAETEC) and the Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL), but all this could change as India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed at the Indian Mobile Congress, which helped in highlighting India\u2019s scope and ambitions with the future technology which India t is developing. The government has begun to recognise the importance of semiconductors and how a domestic semiconductor industry could enable India to reduce its dependence on the giants of the Semiconductor industry and increase the \u2018Atmanhirbar Plan\u2019 of India. The Prime Minister of India aspires to make India a leader in cutting-edge technology, and semiconductors are a key component in achieving this objective. The United States has long sought to isolate its essential technology supply chains from China; India can provide an assist in this endeavour. In this cooperation, India is projected to contribute a total of $20 billion, which may help India become a superpower and compete with nations like China and European markets in the chip race. Many countries, not just the United States, are adopting a \u201cChina Plus One\u201d strategy to reduce their reliance on China and shift their markets to \u201clike-minded countries\u201d such as India. Many private companies, such as Tata and Adana, have also pledged multi-million dollar investments in this project, which can help India\u2019s semiconductor industry grow at a projected rate of $64 billion by 2026, representing a 19% annual growth rate. As India has been relatively weak in this sector, as India\u2019s imports of semiconductors inputs reached $21 billion in 2019 and that figure has been rising rapidly each year, the recent semiconductor manufacturing incentives offered by the government of India will also help the Indian economy as many American companies will expand their capacities in India and this will help in building the right supply chains worldwide and this will also help industries in India. This will also contribute to the growth of the Indian economy.\nConclusion\nWhile all of this is true and will help India in the long run and increase its presence on the global market, India must not forget that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. India must also keep in mind that chip manufacturing requires a great deal of raw materials and that the United States has always been focused on increasing its profits and developing its own industry. The India-United States cooperation cannot be viewed as restrictive to any particular field, and with the rapidly changing geopolitical situation, it is important to remember that China, which is a producer of electronics, is also a consumer, and that one must observe how the semiconductor and high-end chip industries continue and how demand develops.\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Technology\nAI\u2019s Malicious Use and Challenges to International Psychological Security\n\n\n \n\n\nPublished 1 week ago on December 24, 2022\n\n\nBy Evgeny Pashentsev \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn December 2022, the International Center for Social and Political Studies and Consulting published the second report \u201cExperts on the Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to International Psychological Security\u201d, penned by this author. This report stems from the research project titled \u201cMalicious Use of Artificial Intelligence and Challenges to Psychological Security in Northeast Asia\u201d (21-514-92001) and jointly funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) and the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences (VASS). The responses garnered from a targeted survey of twenty-five experts from twelve countries and the subsequent analysis of their feedback aim to bring to light the most serious threats to international information-psychological security (IPS) through malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI), determining how dangerous these threats are, which measures should be used to neutralize them, and identifying the prospects for international cooperation in this area.\nThis publication attempts to define the current level of MUAI threat to the IPS as well as its possible level by 2030. The report pays special attention to the situation in Northeast Asia (NEA), where MUAI practices are based on a combination of a high level of AI technologies in leading countries and a complex of acute contradictions in the region. The results of the second survey allow us to trace the continuity and changes in expert assessments compared to the first survey conducted a year earlier, in which nineteen experts from ten countries took part.\nIn the year since the first expert survey, the world has become even more unstable and dangerous. NATO\u2019s aggressive advance to the East provoked a massive military conflict in Ukraine, one that risks escalating into a world war. Gross domestic product in Ukraine is expected to decline 35 to 40 percent in 2022; Russia also expects a decline of 2,5 percent for the same period. There are clear signs of a recession in the U.S. and the EU, with this economic slowdown reaching even China. Unprecedented inflation, rising borrowing costs, and increasingly intimidating levels of indebtedness are all contributing to fears of economic collapse in many Western and non-Western countries. However, even amid COVID-19, the ultra-rich have little to worry about. In 2022, Forbes identified more than 1,000 billionaires around the world who were richer than they were a year prior (Dolan and Peterson-Withorn, 2022). This deepening polarization in living standards inevitably intensifies the world\u2019s most acute political, racial, and national conflicts across both developing and rich countries\u2014including the United States, long thought immune to such turmoil. In a sick society, threats to psychological security through the malicious use of AI are much higher than in a socially healthy environment. Especially if social regression is observed against the background of the ongoing progress of high technologies.\nThe transition to advanced forms of AI is already happening. In 2022, DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet specializing in AI, announced the creation of an intelligent agent called \u201cGato\u201d that can single-handedly perform more than 600 of different tasks (MSN, 2022). The same network, with the same weights, can play Atari video games, capture images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more. Gato decides whether to produce text, torque joints, press buttons or take other actions based on context (DeepMind, 2022). The agent could outperform human experts in 450 tasks. Gato learns several different tasks at the same time, easily switching from one skill to another without forgetting what it has learned. Previous AI models have started to combine different skills but when starting a new task, these models had to forget what was previously learned in order to move on to the next one. However, Gato does make some mistakes that a human would not make. While Gato is still far from being an AGI creation, progress is still evident. In terms of malicious use, an agent similar to Gato repeatedly, if not by orders of magnitude, reduces the cost of preparing and implementing various actions by one agent. This makes it easier to carry out psychological operations with a combined effect on the senses\u2014an intelligent agent like Gato can simultaneously send text messages, conduct a conversation and so on.\nModern AI capabilities already enable one to influence public consciousness. The president-elect of South Korea, Yoon Suk-yeol, used an unusual strategy during his 2022 election campaign. His campaign team used deepfakes to make an \u201cAI avatar\u201d that helped him win the election. This technology is helpful for appealing to younger voters and to get them more involved (Vastmindz 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s creators believe he is the world\u2019s first official deepfake candidate\u2014a concept that is gaining traction in South Korea, which has the world\u2019s fastest average internet speeds (AFP 2022). AI technology transformed Yoon Suk-yeol into a more modern candidate than his competitors from the perspective of younger voters. With neatly combed, black hair and a smart suit, the avatar looks nearly identical to the real candidate but instead, used salty language and meme-ready quips in a bid to engage younger voters who get their news online (AFPRelaxnews 2022). Some alarms were raised when the avatar politician used humor to try and deflect attention from Yoon\u2019s past scandals (The Times of India 2022). AI Yoon\u2019s pronouncements made headlines in the South Korean media, and seven million people visited the \u201cWiki Yoon\u201d website to question the avatar (AFP 2022). At first glance, AI Yoon could pass for an actual candidate\u2014an apt demonstration of how far artificially generated videos have come in the last few years. \u201cWords that are often spoken by Yoon are better reflected in AI Yoon,\u201d said Baik Kyeong-hoon, director of the AI Yoon team (AFP 2022). However, there is a question about what should be done if the avatar of a statesman, politician or business person is a false representation, reinforcing in the public\u2019s conscious and subconscious mind inflated qualities, creating the illusion of attributes that the real person does not possess. The experience of South Korea\u2019s last presidential campaign may have shown, in part, the initial form of a new method of rather dangerous political manipulation. An increasingly adaptive avatar that does not need rest creates an image that a real person will be able to compete with less and less in the public space. This prompts the question of whether \u201ctelevised presidents\u201d will soon be replaced by \u201cdeepfake presidents\u201d?\nThe world\u2019s first AI TV news anchor was unveiled in China in 2018 (Kuo, 2018), and they were immediately noticeable as the result of an algorithm. However, in December 2021, AI company Xiaoice introduced N Xiaohei and N Xiaobai\u2014virtual replicas of two real-life news anchors\u2014on \u201cAI Business Daily.\u201d According to the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, Xiaoice, in collaboration with National Business Daily, has demonstrated a strong ability to develop virtual replicas that are effectively indistinguishable from real humans through advanced machine learning (ML) and rendering technologies (Lin, 2022). Unfortunately, these extraordinary achievements have the potential to be used for malicious purposes by anti-social actors aiming to destabilize the public consciousness, provoke anti-social actions, and/or deceive individuals.\nNotably, this risk is not purely theoretical, with deepfakes having been used on several occasions to trick companies into sending money by them (Statt, 2019; Stupp, 2019; Veldkamp, 2022). Of course, this practice is not yet common, meaning that the risk is fairly minor\u2014for now. In June 2022, the FBI warned that scammers are beginning to use deepfakes to apple for sensitive jobs; this type of fraud could be used to gain access to company networks and obtain company data (Ferraro and Chipman, 2022).\nAI technologies are being tested in military conflicts, including psychological warfare. The use of Western-produced AI technologies in the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is significant. US facial recognition startup Clearview AI has provided technical support to Ukraine. Clearview AI\u2019s tools can identify faces in videos, comparing them to a company database of 20 billion images from public networks, identifying potential spies and people who have been killed. AI tools also play an important role in Ukraine\u2019s propaganda war and in processing critical conflict information. A program from the US company Primer can perform speech recognition, transcription and translation that captures and analyzes Russian information, including conversations between Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The Swiss encrypted chat service called Threema allows Ukrainian users to send this data to the military without revealing their identities. According to former Google chief executive officer Eric Schmidt, now an AI adviser to the US government, the Ukrainian military receives thousands of such reports every day, which are then filtered by an AI program (Global Times, 2022). Russia has not been slow to respond. The Russian Federation\u2019s Ministry of Defense Office for the Development of Artificial Intelligence conducted an examination of the innovative projects to be presented at the Army 2022 Forum for AI technology use (IMTF \u201cArmy\u20132022,\u201d 2022). Vasily Elistratov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s Department for the Development of AI Technologies, said that special military operation experience in Ukraine is used to improve weapons systems (Ixbt.com, 2022). Unfortunately, the arms race that is growing in terms of both size and participation, not least in the field of AI, is making international security, including its psychological component, less and less durable.\nThe potential for MUAI today is astounding. Noting this, researchers from Collaborations Pharmaceuticals in cooperation with European scientific institutions conducted a conceptual experiment. Instead of synthesizing new drugs, they asked the opposite of the MegaSyn AI neural network: to identify substances that are the most toxic to the human body. The neural network correctly understood the task and, in under six hours, generated a list of 40,000 substances that are optimal components of chemical and biological weapons. The AI independently designed not only many known chemical warfare agents, but also many new ones that are more toxic. This simple inversion of the ML model turned a harmless generative model from a useful tool into an enabler of mass murder (Urbina et al., 2022). It is reasonable to suspect that this inversion approach could be applied to other areas, such as finding optimal ways to have negative psychological impacts on the public consciousness.\nThe most worrisome aspect of these mounting concerns is simple: legislative responses are lagging behind. The sluggish speed of the legislative process (especially relative to that of the MUAI-development process) is clear in the fact that, for example, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, at the time of writing this text, has not yet passed the first reading in the European Parliament (EUR-Lex, 2022).\nIn analyzing the current international situation, most studies focus on economic, military, and geopolitical changes without sufficiently linking them to the growing impact of qualitative technological changes on international dynamics, including those in the sphere of psychological security. This underestimation is clear in the near-complete lack in the literature of a systemic analysis of the possible risks of MUAI to psychological security at individual, group, national, and international levels. The absence of such an analysis is unacceptable for numerous reasons.\nFirst, the penetration of modern AI into countless spheres of life makes it a critical component of continued development and progress. Investment in AI may consist of trillions of dollars within the next two decades. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers Middle East (PwC) report released at the World Government Summit in Dubai, 14 per cent (U.S. $15.7 trillion) of global economic growth will stem from the use of AI by 2030. PwC believes that the greatest gains in 2030 will be in China, where AI will be responsible for up to 26 percent of economic growth (Rao and Verweij, 2018, p. 3). However, as already established, alongside AI\u2019s development will come tremendous risks, including in the field of psychological security.\nSecond, there is already some research into international practices of MUAI in the psychological field. It is short-sighted not to continue existing research on a systemic interdisciplinary basis, taking into account the counter progress of AI technologies and the regression of existing public structures, national and international institutions, and simply wait until the consequences of AI become an even greater threat to international security. At the same time, strong support from state and non-state actors is required for such research that goes beyond such areas as cybersecurity and information security, as well as psychological security before the introduction of AI technologies, because we are talking about qualitatively different possibilities of causing irreparable damage to the development of human civilization than simply quantitative expansion of propaganda capabilities.\nThird, the international situation is continually worsening in several respects. This is not because of particular politicians being in power but because of the severity of the problems faced during the transition to a qualitatively new stage in human development. This transition has been accompanied by an increase in economic problems, socio-political tensions, and geopolitical competition. AI can become both the technological foundation of a new, more socially oriented world order, and the tool of high-tech undemocratic dictatorships, actively used for antisocial purposes by various non-state actors.\nThe conducted expert survey and the subsequent analysis of its results are precisely intended to fill the gap in the awareness of the nature and scope of threats to society associated with modern and future MUAI practices in the context of the global crisis, as well as an assessment of possible risks in this area in the near future. Further research in this direction obviously follows from the nature and dynamics of the changes taking place in the world.\nFrom our partner RIAC\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n Humanity Amidst Insanity: Hope during and after the Indo-Pak Partition\n\n\n\n\n Warriors after War.

When it comes to photography, the James Webb Space Telescope stole the show in 2022, with visuals that reminded us what an outrageously beautiful place the Universe can be (see more on that below). But to tell the truth, over the last 12 months there was no shortage of mind-blowing images that changed our perspectives. Here\u2019s our selection of the best, and what they taught us\u2026 Event Horizon Telescope \u2013 12 May You would have thought if there was a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Galaxy, we\u2019d have noticed it before. But that\u2019s the thing about black holes: you can\u2019t see them. You can only see the gas whirling around them. The one at the centre of the Milky Way, named Sagittarius A*, is around 27,000 light-years away from Earth and we only found it by training eight radio telescopes on it all at the same time. It took 300 researchers and their supercomputers five years to analyse the data they collected before they could finally release this first portrait of the previously unseen object. Yukon, Canada \u2013 21 June This 30,000-year-old baby woolly mammoth, \u2018Nun cho ga\u2019 (big baby animal), takes her name from the H\u00e4n language spoken by Indigenous peoples in Yukon, Canada, where she was found in June. Nun cho ga\u2019s remains were discovered by gold miners and rescued by geologists. It\u2019s thought she probably died after getting stuck in mud, which would have initially preserved her body, but permafrost kept her intact over the millennia. DNA has previously been extracted from much older mammoths, but none so well preserved. Her future is in the hands not just of scientists, but also of the Tr\u2019ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch\u2019in people who own the land where she was found. Jezero crater, Mars \u2013 19 April These shattered remains may look like a failed space mission, but they\u2019re very much a sign of success \u2013 for two reasons. First, these are the backshell and parachute of NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover \u2013 landing gear the robot no longer needed after surviving a 126km/h descent to the surface of Mars in 2021. Second, the picture was taken by Ingenuity, a miniature helicopter with a metre-wide rotor span that caught a ride to the Red Planet with the rover. Ingenuity has a flight range of only 300m but, as of November 2022, had clocked up 34 flights and covered a total of 7km. Images like these help NASA to understand whether a landing occurred as expected and what could be improved for future missions. Read more about space exploration: Servion, Switzerland \u2013 May Hatched at a Swiss zoo in May, this newborn tortoise is the first example of an albino Galapagos giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) known in captivity or the wild. Its mother, pictured in the background, and sibling are both black. According to the zoo, albinism is rarer in tortoises than in humans, with the chance of any tortoise being albino estimated to be around 1 in 100,000. However, while this baby may be unique, its lack of the skin pigment melanin makes it particularly susceptible to skin cancer. In the wild, this extra threat to an already endangered species would seem to make survival unlikely, but in captivity it can be kept out of sunlight. Read more about tortoises and turtles: International research team \u2013 17 August Are we descended from a 530-million-year-old animal with a giant mouth and no anus? Apparently not. Well, good. That\u2019s one thing scientists have sorted out this year. We\u2019re all done here. Unless, of course, you\u2019re wondering whose family tree this bumless blob (officially Saccorhytus coronarius) belongs to. The answer, according to the latest thinking, is crabs, spiders and roundworms. Previous evidence linking it to our line was based on limited specimens. The new work, involving high-resolution imaging and many specimens, enabled researchers to create the detailed reconstructions shown here. Rice University, Texas \u2013 25 July Researchers from Rice University thought it would be fun to turn a dead spider into a robotic gripper, in order to pick up other objects. Overkill, perhaps, but they claim that it heralds a new era of \u2018necrobotics\u2019 (robots made from dead things). Actually, their technique is pretty simple: take a spider, stick a syringe in it, then apply pressure by squirting air into its cold, dead body. This works because spiders use hydraulics to force haemolymph (their version of blood) into their limbs, forcing them to extend. When spiders die, they lose this ability, and so they curl up. Dimorphos \u201326 September This was one of the last images NASA\u2019s DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) spacecraft transmitted. Just 11 seconds later, it crashed into its target, the asteroid Dimorphos (pictured here from 68km away), at around 24,000km/h. Despite being fatal for the spacecraft, the mission proved a hit for the US space agency. After crunching the data, it confirmed that DART had successfully altered the trajectory of Dimorphos in its orbit around its parent asteroid, Didymos. So, hopefully, when bigger, badder asteroids look set to destroy Earth, we now have the knowledge to send them off-course. University of Cambridge, UK \u2013 7 March Two-thirds of a millimetre might not sound very tall, but when you\u2019re a bacterium, it\u2019s bigger than the Empire State Building. It\u2019s also the height of these 600-micrometre-high \u2018nano-skyscrapers\u2019, which are actually tiny 3D-printed towers of electrodes that UK researchers built to house light-harvesting organisms called cyanobacteria, which make their energy via photosynthesis, just like plants. The towers are designed to cram in as many cyanobacteria as possible while maximising their exposure to sunlight. By plugging into the electrodes, the scientists show that it\u2019s possible to use cyanobacteria as a source of sustainable energy. New Mexico, USA \u2013 September This is SpinLaunch: a prototype system for launching satellites and other payloads into space using kinetic energy instead of the chemical fuel in traditional rockets. The prototype is a third of the size of the planned 100m-wide full-scale system, but is capable of spinning payloads at 8,000km/h and 10,000G before flinging them skyward through a launch tube. Although small rocket engines will still be needed to get payloads into orbit, it\u2019s claimed the system cuts down on fuel and infrastructure by around 70 per cent. In April, SpinLaunch signed a \u2018Space Act Agreement\u2019 with NASA and by September was testing the system with components of the space agency\u2019s own satellites. International Space Station \u2013 22 July On 22 July, Samantha Cristoforetti emerged from the airlock of the International Space Station (ISS) as the first-ever European woman to take a spacewalk. There was no time to bask in the glory though, as the Italian astronaut had work to do on the new European Robotic Arm (ERA), a robotic attachment to the space station designed to cut down on the need for human spacewalks. Staying outside for seven hours in all, she and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev installed new parts on the ERA. In September, Cristoforetti became the first female European commander of the ISS before returning to Earth safely in October. Norwich, UK \u2013 21 October Plants don\u2019t have nerves. For a long time, though, scientists were fascinated by the fact that they seemed to deploy one of the chemical messengers that humans use to transmit nerve impulses \u2013 calcium \u2013 when they get injured. However, this year, scientists at the John Innes Centre in the UK used new fluorescent imaging techniques (pictured here in cress seedlings) to show that this calcium rush isn\u2019t a moving wave or impulse. Instead, it\u2019s a response to another chemical, glutamate, that\u2019s released at the injury site. Glutamate molecules travel along the corridors between plant cells, triggering the opening of cell \u2018doors\u2019 that let out calcium as they go. So it\u2019s glutamate, not calcium, that\u2019s the messenger. Curtin University, Australia \u2013 12 July In 2011, a nomad named Bahba picked up a lump of black rock in the Sahara Desert. It turned out to be a piece of 4.5-billion-year-old meteorite forged in magma chambers below the surface of a young Mars and flung to Earth when a comet hit the Red Planet 5-10 million years ago. Now known as \u2018Black Beauty\u2019, it took scientists until this year to pinpoint the meteorite\u2019s origins in the Terra Cimmeria-Sirenum province (circled). The Australian team did it by analysing 94 million Martian craters, colour-coded here by age and size. Given Black Beauty is so old, they think the region could hold clues to the planet\u2019s early history. Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland \u2013 3 August Iceland is well known for its lava fields, but new volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula close to Reykjavik is proving particularly accessible to day-trippers from the capital. This eruption in the Meradalir Valley, starting on 3 August, attracted thrill-seeking hikers to a 300km fissure in the Earth\u2019s crust that, within a fortnight, had spewed out 10 million cubic metres of lava. It came just a year after another large vent opened up a kilometre away. Until then, the region hadn\u2019t seen any major volcanic activity since the 12th Century, when medieval Iceland was ruled over by chieftains known as go\u00f0or\u00f0. Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory \u2013 9 October Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) emanate from high-energy explosions occurring when massive stars much hotter than our Sun collapse to form black holes or neutron stars. Pictured is GRB 221009A, the brightest GRB ever witnessed, detected on 9 October and lasting a full 10 hours. It was so bright that even the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope \u2013 designed specifically for GRBs \u2013 couldn\u2019t deal with what it was emitting. But as the energy emitted by such an explosion is converted into different kinds of radiation, the X-ray telescope aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was able to capture this image from X-rays as they bounced off dust in the Galaxy. GRB 221009A took place about 1.9 billion light-years away, which is close in GRB terms. Al-Rastan, Syria \u2013 12 October Part of this 120m mosaic was unearthed in the Syrian city of Al-Rastan during the Syrian Civil War, but it\u2019s only now that archaeologists have been able to excavate it more completely. The 1,600-year-old artwork, photographed in October, depicts scenes of soldiers fighting in the Trojan War, which according to Greek mythology involved the Greeks sneaking into the city of Troy in a wooden horse. It may extend even further than 120m2 \u2013 the excavation is still ongoing. Other artworks and places of historical importance, including mosaics and churches, were destroyed during the Syrian conflict in the last decade, but museum researchers still hope to discover more beneath the ruins. London, UK \u2013 12 July This stunning image beamed to Earth by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveals details of far-flung regions of the Milky Way that we\u2019ve never seen before. Launched on Christmas Day 2021, from a spaceport in French Guiana, the JWST is the largest telescope ever sent into space. It uses infrared light to show us stars that were previously obscured from view by dust. Its first images, broadcast here to crowds in Piccadilly Circus, London, show the edge of a star-forming region around 7,600 light-years from Earth, in the Carina Nebula, which is home to stars millions of times brighter than our Sun. Read more about the James Webb Space Telescope: Mexico City, Mexico \u2013 18 October The Atlas 2030 exoskeleton was specially designed for children by Spanish robotics engineer and inventor, Elena Garc\u00eda Armada. Until now, exoskeletons have been a high-tech addition to rehab programmes for adult patients who have suffered strokes or traumatic brain and spinal injuries. But the suits can\u2019t just be downsized for children, whose physical limitations are more often related to neurological conditions \u2013 as in the case of David Zabala (pictured), who has cerebral palsy. These conditions require a more \u2018intelligent\u2019 suit that can read the intention of the walker and adapt its gait accordingly.

BBC News in London is no exception, and embraced the future in 2013 to the extent of replacing its flesh-and-blood camera operators with robotic cameras. On the face of it this made sense; it was cheaper, and newsroom cameras are most likely to record as set range of very similar shots. A decade later they\u2019re to be retired in a victory for humans, as the corporation tires of the stream of viral fails leaving presenters scrambling to catch up. A media story might seem slim pickings for Hackaday readers, however there\u2019s food for thought in there for the technically minded. It seems the cameras had a set of pre-programmed maneuvers which the production teams could select for their different shots, and it was too easy for the wrong one to be enabled. There\u2019s also a suggestion that the age of the system might have something to do with it, but this is somewhat undermined by their example which we\u2019ve placed below being from when the cameras were only a year old. Given that a modern TV studio is a tightly controlled space and that detecting the location of the presenter plus whether they are in shot or not should not have been out of reach in 2013, so we\u2019re left curious as to why they haven\u2019t taken this route. Perhaps OpenCV to detect a human, or simply detecting the audio levels on the microphones before committing to a move could do the job. Either way we welcome the camera operators back even if we never see them, though we\u2019ll miss the viral funnies.   Honestly\u2026 to me, this looks more like a bad interface design. Yeah, that\u2019s how I understood the article as presented as well.  Seems more like a case study of now not to do a user interface. Hi Jenny  I\u2019m afraid this is wrong. \u201cEmbraced the future in 2013 to the extent of replacing its flesh-and-blood camera operators with robotic cameras. \u201d BBC News hasn\u2019t had human camera operators on the studio floor much at all in its history of TV news production. Remember the 1990s blue cut glass studio?  That had robotic camera pedestals remotely controlled from the control room.  Remote control camera mountings such as those from Evershed Powers Optics/EPO, Radamec, Vinten, Shotoku, Furio and now Electric Friends have been in use by BBC News since the late 1950s or early 1960s. News had them at Alexandra Palace before they moved to TV Centre.  A few times in the history of BBC News bulletin production they have reintroduced a floor operator or two for very high profile programmes like the Six and Ten O\u2019Clock News \u2013 but News 24 has relied on directors to remotely control cameras since it launched in 1997\u2026  The change that happened with the move from TV Centre to NBH in 2013 was not related to the use of remote cameras \u2013 that was business as usual. The change was instead due to a change in how the remote cameras were controlled.  In 2013 the newsroom automation system that also controls vision mixing, graphics, screen routing, captions etc. was expanded in scope to also recall preset camera shots based on instructions entered in the newsroom scripting system.  If these codes are entered incorrectly / the presenter misunderstands where they should be these change.  AIUI the recent reporting in Deadline around this may be related to a possible procurement discussion about replacing the 10 year old Furio remote controlled track cameras in one or two studios with a replacement.  I directed BBC News 24 and then BBC One/Six/Nine/Ten O\u2019Clock bulletins daily from 1997 to 2007 \u2013 and I can assure you we seldom had \u2018flesh and blood camera operators\u2019 on the studio floor.  You had remote controlled cameras that were remotely controlled either by the director or a single lighting/camera/vision operator from the studio control room.  If the camera pedestals needed to be repositioned in the studios that didn\u2019t have fully robotic pedestals, the floor manager would reposition them, off shot. This is why I love HAD.  Also, I bet you have some stories to share\u2026? Broadcast engineer here at a location where we make use of robotic cameras.  Not with an automation system to operate the shots however.  We have a single robotic operator who can recall shots and override if issue arise. As Steve mentions this is not a robotic camera issue.  Miscues in the newsroom automation will cause this kind of malfunction.  If someone has the shots out of sequence OR one gets deleted when the scripts are being constructed, all bets are off. I have worked with Radamec, Shotoku, Fujinon, Telemetrics, and a host of other systems and with rare exception the robotics are rarely at fault. Somebody at BBC is making a terrible move by doing full on replacement.  What they should consider is preview software to run through the script and show the expected shots based on what the newsroom automation system will play out. My company will never adopt these automation systems for a variety of reasons, but the biggest reason is we like having a robotic operator at all times.  Yes, we save money by not needing to man 4 to 6 cameras for a news show.  But we also enjoy a live operator at all times.  Note that we do save shots and moves, but those are triggered by the same operator, not some automation software at the whim of a mistyped cue by a Production Assistant who doesn\u2019t know any better.  They tend to do copy/paste rather than check their work. For those interested : https://youtu.be/dEW-MW8SsMw?t=540 at about 9\u201900\u201d in shows the robotic cameras we had in BBC News in the late 90s. And here is a much earlier robot camera used in 1960ish :\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/p1.html\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/pix/epo-rob-boroc.pdf That is fascinating, thank you so much for sharing Is there a prospect for this job to operators a bit less equipped? Asking for a friend. Did we read the same article? Because right in the second paragraph: >The British broadcaster has begun the process of acquiring new automated cameras They are upgrading one set of robot cameras for another. I send back your ping-pong ball: > (Title) New cameras, same glitches\n>\n> The BBC has not disclosed how much the robot camera refit will cost, but the broadcaster has recent experience of installing new news studio cameras.\n>\n> Studio B, which is home to BBC1\u2019s flagship 10PM and 6PM bulletins, was revamped earlier this year with new automated cameras from Norwegian company Electric Friends.\n>\n>The technology has not been without problems, however. Just last month, a camera swung around to show the wrong part of the studio during Yeah.  And ironically, it says that one of the features of the old, buggier system was that it _did_ face tracking / ID.  (Apparently, not very well.) Live camera operators can have their moments also, not just automated cameras.\nBack in the 70\u2019s my late father was at a South Dakota television station to arrange broadcast ads for his furniture store. They took him into the studio to watch the live, evening news broadcast.\nThe weatherman was known for being all business, with no sense of humor. That night, before my father, the cameraman stepped from behind the camera and dropped his pants. At first, the weatherman did not respond, but then started laughing on camera. He was not laughing at the cameraman. He saw that the station manager\u2019s wife was standing in the back of the studio, witnessing the cameraman\u2019s antics. Former cameraman after something like that. This one from March 2021 is even better:\nhttps://youtu.be/Nos95w_oad8 Fabulous! I can see them going to \u201creality\u201d shooting like so many prime time TV shows. A modern lightweight handheld camera and plenty of coffee in the studio is all we need. I\u2019d prefer it if they went back to the \u2018good old days\u2019 \u2026\u2026  when they reported actual news and not propaganda\u2026.

If the camera pedestals needed to be repositioned in the studios that didn\u2019t have fully robotic pedestals, the floor manager would reposition them, off shot.\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nDan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 4:52 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThis is why I love HAD. \nAlso, I bet you have some stories to share\u2026?\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nrobomonkey says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 9:58 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nBroadcast engineer here at a location where we make use of robotic cameras.  Not with an automation system to operate the shots however.  We have a single robotic operator who can recall shots and override if issue arise.\nAs Steve mentions this is not a robotic camera issue.  Miscues in the newsroom automation will cause this kind of malfunction.  If someone has the shots out of sequence OR one gets deleted when the scripts are being constructed, all bets are off.\nI have worked with Radamec, Shotoku, Fujinon, Telemetrics, and a host of other systems and with rare exception the robotics are rarely at fault.\nSomebody at BBC is making a terrible move by doing full on replacement.  What they should consider is preview software to run through the script and show the expected shots based on what the newsroom automation system will play out.\nMy company will never adopt these automation systems for a variety of reasons, but the biggest reason is we like having a robotic operator at all times.  Yes, we save money by not needing to man 4 to 6 cameras for a news show.  But we also enjoy a live operator at all times.  Note that we do save shots and moves, but those are triggered by the same operator, not some automation software at the whim of a mistyped cue by a Production Assistant who doesn\u2019t know any better.  They tend to do copy/paste rather than check their work.\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nSteve says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 2:28 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nFor those interested : https://youtu.be/dEW-MW8SsMw?t=540 at about 9\u201900\u201d in shows the robotic cameras we had in BBC News in the late 90s.\nAnd here is a much earlier robot camera used in 1960ish :\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/p1.html\nhttps://www.tvcameramuseum.org/bbc/robot/pix/epo-rob-boroc.pdf\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nEric says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 8:33 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThat is fascinating, thank you so much for sharing\n\n\nReport comment \nReply  \n\n\nRumble_in_the_Jungle says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30, 2022 at 4:31 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIs there a prospect for this job to operators a bit less equipped?

The test was a smashing success and a critical step in the US space program. But the Saturn V was also incredibly loud\u2014so loud that a rumor emerged claiming that the acoustic energy was sufficient to melt concrete. That is not the case, according to an August paper published in a special educational issue if the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA). \"The Saturn V has taken on this sort of legendary, apocryphal status,\" said co-author Kenneth Gee of Brigham Young University. \"We felt that, as part of the JASA special issue on Education in Acoustics, it was an opportunity to correct misinformation about this vehicle.\" In addition to the authors' analysis, the paper includes several problems for students to solve relating to the event\u2014including a tongue-in-cheek problem involving using acoustic temperature to make a grilled cheese sandwich. German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who helped build the V-2 rocket, came to work for NASA in 1945 as part of Operation Paperclip. His job was to share his accumulated knowledge with the Army's rocket division. But when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 in 1957, priorities shifted and von Braun's team was charged with developing an equivalent US rocket. The Juno 1 launched the first US satellite in January 1958, and served as a prototype for the Saturn series for deployment for Earth orbit and lunar missions.. The Apollo 4 mission launched with a Saturn V on November 9, 1967, at 7 AM EST. When the five F-1 engines ignited eight seconds before liftoff, the sound pressure produced was so powerful that the waves buffeted the Vehicle Assembly Building, Launch Control Center, and press buildings even though the launch pad was more than three miles (five kilometers) away. CBS reporter Walter Cronkite and his producer had to hold onto their trailer's observation window as ceiling tiles fell to the floor, fearing it would shatter from the noise. Cronkite later claimed it was the most frightening space mission he'd covered. As one observer of a Saturn V launch described it: \"It's like continuous thunder, and when you think it can't get any louder, it does. I remember the vibration seeming to pass into my bones... The bird rises, the flames spew and the thunder continues, rising in pitch as it climbs, finally dissipating into a sound like a billion sheets of heavy paper being torn lengthwise for a whole minute.\" Something that memorable was bound to inspire a few exaggerated claims and unsubstantiated rumors over the ensuing decades. Gee et al. conducted a review of online forums and discussion boards, and were dismayed by the amount of disinformation that had proliferated on them. In addition to claiming the sound level was sufficient to melt concrete, there were claims that it lit \"grass ablaze over a mile away,\" and was powerful enough to \"ignite the hair of bystanders\" and \"blast rainbows from the sky.\" Per the authors, \"Such claims elicit awe at the power of the vehicle that propelled humans to the Moon, but are nevertheless based on a flawed understanding of the true acoustic environment.\" Their analysis of that acoustic environment incorporates NASA footage of the Apollo 17 launch\u2014digitized by the Discovery Channel for a 2008 documentary\u2014in which sound waves can actually be seen shortly after engine ignition because of the humid atmosphere and backlighting. Their physics-based model pegged the acoustic level at 203 decibels. Per Gee, 170 dB is equivalent to ten aircraft engines, while 200 dB is equivalent to 10,000 aircraft engines. Given that the human threshold for pain is around 130 dB, that's pretty darn loud. It just wasn't loud enough to melt concrete or set grass on fire. Gee et al. think the myth evolved out of confusion between sound power (comparable to a light bulb's wattage) and sound pressure (akin to the brightness of a light bulb) This would lead to faulty attempts to calculate the acoustic power of a Saturn V launch. If it turns out that reports of burning grass or melting concrete are confirmed, it would more likely be caused by radiative heating from the plume or debris\u2014not the sound of the Saturn V.

      "sequence": "In 2022, decades of work finally came to fruition as the James Webb Space Telescope fired up and began training its unprecedented eyes on the universe. From distant galaxies to our nearby neighbors, let\u2019s look back at some of the most impressive images the telescope has captured so far. The successor to Hubble, James Webb scans the skies in infrared, and that combined with the unprecedented size of its mirror allows the telescope to peer deeper into space and further back in time than any other observatory. Using this power, Webb\u2019s mission is to study the formation and evolution of stars, planets and galaxies, especially those that formed soon after the Big Bang. It may even find the first signs of extraterrestrial life. NASA released the first batch of images to the public in July, including a view of a distant cluster of galaxies magnified by a gravitational lens, a nebula cast off from a dying star and another that\u2019s birthing new ones. Since then, James Webb has been busy producing image after stunning image, revealing new details of galaxies, nebulae and famous celestial landmarks like the Pillars of Creation. Closer to home, it showed Jupiter in a new light, and gave us the clearest look yet at Neptune\u2019s rings. And of course, this is just the beginning. James Webb is planned to examine the cosmos for at least the next decade, and if it\u2019s anything like its predecessor Hubble, its mission could be extended for another decade beyond that. So come take a look through the highlights of the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s first six months in operation in our gallery. Source: NASA on Flickr",

From distant galaxies to our nearby neighbors, let\u2019s look back at some of the most impressive images the telescope has captured so far.The successor to Hubble, James Webb scans the skies in infrared, and that combined with the unprecedented size of its mirror allows the telescope to peer deeper into space and further back in time than any other observatory. Using this power, Webb\u2019s mission is to study the formation and evolution of stars, planets and galaxies, especially those that formed soon after the Big Bang. It may even find the first signs of extraterrestrial life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inner edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula, captured in infrared light by James WebbNASA, ESA, CSA, STScI\n\n\nNASA released the first batch of images to the public in July, including a view of a distant cluster of galaxies magnified by a gravitational lens, a nebula cast off from a dying star and another that\u2019s birthing new ones.Since then, James Webb has been busy producing image after stunning image, revealing new details of galaxies, nebulae and famous celestial landmarks like the Pillars of Creation.

      "sequence": "Tucked away in a small suburb on the outskirts of Boston, an Amazon Robotics facility serves as the unassuming birthplace of some of the company\u2019s most exciting technologies. From the outside, the facility looks like any other building in the area. On the inside, you\u2019ll find roboticists, technicians, and a host of other employees working on cutting-edge robots that will operate in fulfillment centers around the world\u2014making it easier and safer for employees to fulfill customer orders. Amazon recently invited nearly 100 reporters inside the facility for a rare look at the research and projects going on inside, and our team tagged along. Here are some of the most innovative things we found while roaming the halls of the Amazon Robotics facility in Westborough, Massachusetts. A nod to Amazon\u2019s innovation mindset greeted us in the lobby, where a digital art display of black metal rods and circular lights spanned a wall behind the reception desk. The slow, subtle light transitions were mesmerizing\u2014we could have stared at it all day. We made a quick stop at the coffee bar, then headed out to the manufacturing floor. The first thing we noticed in the vast facility was a series of fenced areas where robots are tested, including the Hercules robot. From its small blue base, this small but mighty robot lifts and carries up to a thousand pounds of product across designated areas of Amazon fulfillment centers. As we moved through the halls, we spotted the testing area for Robin, a robotic arm that handles packaged items in fulfillment centers. Smaller blue robots called Pegasus were delivering test packages to Robin to be picked up and placed on a conveyer belt. Also undergoing testing was an exciting new robotic arm called Sparrow. Jason Messinger, principal technical product manager with Amazon Robotics, took us to a restricted room at the back of the building for a sneak peek. Sparrow will be able to help employees working in fulfillment centers by picking individual items and storing them in inventory before the products are packaged and sent to customers. Messinger powered up Sparrow to give us a rare, first look at how it works.   When we were done marveling at Sparrow, Mikell Taylor, principal technical program manager for Amazon Robotics, took us to a special testing area where we met another new technology called Proteus.  Proteus is Amazon\u2019s first fully autonomous robot that will work alongside employees in fulfillment centers. The robots will transport heavy carts carrying packages for loading onto trucks for customer delivery. Proteus operates in open spaces in Amazon facilities, unlike previous-generation mobile robots that work in restricted areas. Proteus uses sensors and a map of the facility to safely navigate new spaces. A few of the robots were showing off their skills and moving around us while we were in the testing area. As we made our way through the rest of the testing floor, Taylor answered our burning question: How does Amazon choose the robots\u2019 names? She said the team takes inspiration from space to name Amazon\u2019s suite of mobile robots. Proteus, for example, is named after a moon of Neptune. Once we\u2019d satisfied our curiosities in the testing area, we headed to the manufacturing line where the robots are built. Erika McClosky, director of global robotics manufacturing at Amazon, gave us a full tour. She explained that there are 10 stations on each manufacturing line. Each line produces a robot every hour during production\u2014and Amazon can produce up to 1,000 robots each day.  McClosky walked us through the process of building Hercules, the small product-moving robot we saw earlier in the testing area. The manufacturing process starts with a simple base plate and ends with an incredibly strong, smart robot. McClosky explained that once the robots have made it through the manufacturing and testing process, they drive themselves to a charging station for one last charge before they go to their new home at an Amazon fulfillment center. After a long day of walking the floor at the Amazon Robotics facility\u2014and learning about all the innovative research and work being done inside\u2014we were ready to take ourselves home too. We bid adieu to the picturesque campus in Westborough and boarded a bus back to Boston. Until next time! Learn more about how Amazon Robotics support employees in fulfillment centers.",

      "sequence": "Many traditionalist companies that tried to force their employees back to the office experienced extensive drama and stress over this coercive approach, and had to roll back their plans, with all that effort wasted. The monumental battle over remote work is heating up this winter as more traditionalist business leaders are demanding that their employees come to the office much or all of the time.  Google maps workers, asked to come back to the office full-time recently, fought back with a petition and threats of a strike, and won a reprieve of 90 days. Elon Musk demanded that all Tesla staff come to the office full-time despite insufficient spaces at Tesla offices, resulting in Tesla staff getting recruited by other companies. Apple employees are pushing back publicly against the leadership\u2019s demand for three days in the office, with a recent letter saying \u201cstop treating us like school kids who need to be told when to be where and what homework to do.\u201d\u202fGM rolled back its return to office requirement after a backlash from employees.  The same struggles are happening at smaller US companies, as well as across the globe. Yet what these traditionalist executives are failing to realize is that the drama, stress, and tensions caused by their demands won\u2019t matter. Mostly or fully remote work will win this winter.  That\u2019s because of the new COVID surge.\u202fIn the\u202fpast two weeks, reported cases have increased by 53 percent, and hospitalizations have risen by 31 percent.\u202f  Perhaps you think COVID vaccines might protect us from this problem? Think again.\u202f  A Kaiser Permanente study on the original Omicron strain, BA.1, found that after two doses of Pfizer, vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission was at 41% after 9 months. A booster shot increased effectiveness against hospitalization to 85% for a couple of months, but it wore off quickly to 55% after three or more months.  Note that this is vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization, not infection: the vaccine is much weaker against infection. And it\u2019s for the original Omicron strain BA.1, not BA.5, which is much more capable of immune escape, more transmissible, and causes more severe disease.\u202f  Let\u2019s not forget that less than three-quarters of eligible Americans are vaccinated, and less than half of all vaccinated Americans received a booster shot.   What about the new bivalent booster, which is more effective against BA.5? As of November 24, only 14% of those older than 18 received the new booster. And according to a just-released Morning Consult\u202fsurvey, 53% of U.S. adults say they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d get a COVID-19 booster in the next year, down from 58% who said the same in a\u202fSeptember survey.   There is a similar drop in respondents\u2019 willingness to get an annual booster: 51% said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d get annual shots in the latest survey, down from 56%.  Moreover, a new study shows that after an initial COVID infection, each subsequent infection with COVID results in higher risks of hospitalization and death.\u202f  In other words, after an initial infection, you end up with long-term or permanent damage that is exacerbated by subsequent infections. Thus, it\u2019s important to minimize the number of times we get infected with COVID.  Unfortunately, COVID isn\u2019t the only health threat running rampant. The flu and RSV have also had extraordinarily high case rates so far this season.   The implication is clear: this winter will see a major surge of infections, which has already started.  During both the Delta surge and the Omicron surge, traditionalist companies that tried to force their employees back to the office, and experienced extensive drama and stress over this coercive approach, had to roll back their plans, with all that effort wasted.\u202f  Besides, the yo-yoing of going back and forth from home to the office and back home seriously undermined productivity, harmed engagement and morale, and impaired retention and recruitment. We\u2019ll see the exact same yo-yoing at Tesla, Apple, Google, and other companies led by traditionalist executives in the next several months.\u202f  So why do they pursue this doomed effort to push their staff into the office? After all, these executives have the same information I do, and the implication is clear.  The key lies in what makes these executives feel successful and feeds their identity as leaders.\u202f  In fact, one leader wrote an op-ed piece about this topic, saying \u201cThere\u2019s a deeply personal reason why I want to go back to the office. It\u2019s selfish, but I don\u2019t care. I feel like I lost a piece of my identity in the pandemic\u2026 I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t truly find myself again if I have to work from home for the rest of my life.\u201d   By honestly saying the quiet part out loud, this op-ed reveals how other leaders use false claims about remote work undermining productivity, innovation, and social capital to try to cover up their true concerns.\u202f  This personal, selfish orientation speaks to a mental blindspot called the egocentric bias, an orientation toward prioritizing one\u2019s own perspective and worldview over others.  It is important to empathize with and understand where such leaders are coming from, but following their personal and selfish predisposition will hurt the bottom lines for their companies.\u202f  What works much better is a hybrid-first, team-led model: a flexible approach where individual team leads consult with their team members to decide what works best for them.  That goes for large companies, such as my client Applied Materials, a Fortune 200 high-tech manufacturer. It adopted an \u201cExcellence from Anywhere\u201d modality that focuses on deliverables rather than where someone works. That also goes for middle-size organizations, including another client, the Information Sciences Institute, a 400-staff data science and machine learning research center at the University of Southern California. ISI used this approach to gain leadership in hybrid and remote work.  Team members at Applied and ISI come to the office once or twice a week, whether to socialize or to collaborate more intensely, since for most people, intense collaboration works best in-person. Otherwise, team members stay at home, since workers are substantially more productive working remotely. And as cases of illness increase in their area, the teams flexibly adapt their approach to collaborate and socialize fully remotely.\u202f  A third client, the Jaeb Center for Health Research, chose to adopt a home-centric model. That\u2019s because surveys showed the large majority of its staff wanted full-time remote work. Moreover, their research-focused activities are more individualized and less team-oriented than those at ISI or Applied. They only come to the office on rare occasions for meetings or training. Such remote-first, home-centric models will work well for organizations where individual employee productivity, rather than team productivity, is more important.  In short, flexible models \u2014 while going against the intuitions of many leaders \u2014 best fit the desires of most employees, whose biggest non-salary demand is flexibility. They address the risks associated with COVID variants, flu and RSV, as well as other emergencies. And finally, they maximize profits for companies, by boosting retention, recruitment, collaboration, innovation, and productivity.   The only obstacle is the personal, selfish orientation of traditionalist leaders, who need to recognize the danger they are posing to the success of their companies if they pursue their backward-looking coercive efforts to get their staff to return to the office.  \nDr. Gleb Tsipursky helps tech and finance industry executives seize competitive advantage in hybrid work by driving employee retention, collaboration, and innovation through behavioral science as the CEO of the future-of-work consultancy Disaster Avoidance Experts, and authored the best-seller Leading Hybrid and Remote Teams: A Manual on Benchmarking to Best Practices for Competitive Advantage.

From left to right: Space studies students Shae Rackley (mission support), Alexis Lojek (commander), Sarah Guthrie, Noah Loy and Cody Ball (mission specialists) During the fall of 2022, the American Public University System Analog Research Group (AARG) completed its third space research mission. An analog mission is a terrestrial simulation designed to mimic life in space, and participants \u2013 known as analog astronaut crews \u2013 are isolated in specially constructed facilities for a predetermined period. During that time, the crews live, work and perform research as astronauts. Start a Space Studies degree at American Military University. While analog facilities cannot exactly duplicate all of the conditions of space habitats, they do provide excellent opportunities to study different aspects of the astronaut experience. For instance, they provide an environment where protocols, crew relations and important research can be performed with varying degrees of realism. For the crews, it\u2019s the chance to gain firsthand experience of the astronaut lifestyle and work as a member of space a research team. Four graduate and undergraduate students from our space studies department spent 14 days in the Inflatable Lunar-Mars Analog Habitat (ILMAH), located on the University of North Dakota (UND) campus in Grand Forks, North Dakota. This space research mission marked AARG\u2019s third time at ILMAH; it began on September 28 and ended on October 11. The four-person crew consisted of: Tyler Hines, another space studies undergraduate student, acted as the flight director for ARG-3I, with Sarah Guthrie as deputy flight director. The flight directors were responsible for mission planning and preparation. The mission motto was \u201cTercio est Leporem,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cthe third time\u2019s the charm.\u201d This motto proved to be very apt as the mission was highly successful. The ARG-3I crew had an ambitious schedule involving a wide range of research projects, focusing on extravehicular activities (EVAs), technology testing and psychology studies. Other research projects included plant growth studies and participation in research projects contributed by UND students and partners. The crew devoted a major portion of their time to a variety of EVA studies. One of the strengths of ILMAH is the availability of realistic EVA suits that the crew can use. The North Dakota Experimental 2 \u2013 Analog Trainer (NDX-2AT) suits are trainer versions of spacesuit prototypes and are weighted to simulate lunar gravity. The ARG-3I crew evaluated improvements to both the mobility and fit of the suits through a series of space research activities. They also continued the EVA communications study initiated during the ARG-2I mission. This third study aimed to improve the audio and visual communications between astronauts participating in an EVA and the intra-vehicular activity (IVA) support team. High-quality communications are vital for safety during EVAs, which are inherently risky due to increased exposure to the space environment of space, which is not supportive of life. Anytime crews venture outside the protection of their spacecraft, they are at increased risk of injury and even death. Improving communications during EVAs helps the IVA identify and mitigate these risks. Monitoring suit levels allows the IVA team to detect and prevent potential health hazards before conditions reach dangerous levels. The crew also worked with the Kinetic Utilization Resource Tool (KURT) to further investigate EVA rescue maneuvers initiated during ARG-2i. All of these studies represent important contributions to the safety of future astronauts. One of the new research studies performed during ARG-3I involved testing the technology to create oxygen through electrolysis of water. Water molecules are composed of oxygen and hydrogen atoms, both of which can be used as a fuel source. In addition to its potential for fuel, oxygen is important for life support. Water is an abundant resource in space; large amounts of water have been detected on both the moon and Mars. Off-world settlements can use this water as a source of fuel and life support if it can be effectively mined and processed on site, which would allow lunar and Martian settlements to be less reliant on Earth resources. The AARG-3I crew tested oxygen production using a small electrolysis device to investigate how different conductors and solutes affect production rates and to determine how much power was needed to produce oxygen. The data from this space research experiment provided important insights into the best environment to conduct electrolysis efficiently and sustainably. The ARG-3I crew participated in a series of continuing studies evaluating the effects of living in an isolated, confined environment (ICE). These projects are part of an ongoing AARG research initiative to better understand how the stress induced by ICE affects crew interactions and how to mitigate these effects. ICE is a serious concern for space exploration. Both spacecraft and potential surface habitats represent isolated, high-risk environments, which cause detrimental psychological effects in spacecraft crews. Analog environments, however, are ideal locations to test crew relations and stress mitigation strategies. The ARG-3I crew participated in AARG\u2019s current Facial Emotion Recognition and Mindfulness Breathing studies, extending the knowledge gained from previous missions. They also participated in a new sleep study evaluating the effects of increased levels of CO2, common in ICE, on sleep quality and mood. AARG has performed many different plant growth experiments during our time at ILMAH, thanks to the habitat\u2019s high-quality plant production module. For this mission, the crew participated in a unique study investigating the possibility of using humanure as a growth medium for a variety of vascular plants, including cucumber and sweet peppers. The ARG-3I crew also participated in several studies in collaboration with UND and its partners. These space research projects included a cardiobreath study to evaluate the importance of exercise for astronaut crew health. This study was run through a partnership between Simon Frasier University and UND, and astronauts on the International Space Station have also performed this research. Biosolids are currently used in many countries and provide a possible solution to the problem of nutrient-poor growing materials (regolith) on the Moon and Mars. During ARG-3I, the crew studied the growth of a variety of plants in simulated regolith, using humanure as a fertilizer during the mission. They also analyzed the soil samples to determine the ideal ratio for plant growth as well as the health of the plants. ARG-3I also helped maintain a plant growth study for UND and used a UND-developed time-delay system for communications, known as ECHO. Due to the distance between the Earth and Mars, communication delays between crews and terrestrial mission control can be as long as 20 minutes. If emergencies occur or astronauts need help, those delays create problems.   Testing communication best practices in analog settings helps space research participants to develop procedures and minimize the risks introduced by these delays. The crew used ECHO to simulate a 10-minute, one-way time delay in communications with mission control and noted several areas where MC/crew communications need to be improved to support mission success. They also evaluated the use of private channels supporting communications with family, which were very successful and increased crew morale. The ARG-3I mission managed a full schedule very well, successfully completing a record number of research projects during its two-week mission. They set a high standard for future missions and represented our University extremely well. Congratulations to the crew and flight directors for a successful and productive mission!

      "sequence": "Welcome to OurGlobal Community of Tech Investors No two themes attract more retail investor interest than space and cannabis. Who doesn\u2019t like watching science fiction movies and taking bong rips? If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, then there\u2019s the potential for alpha on offer, provided you can stomach all the volatility. Recently, we posed the question, Just How Low Can Space Stocks Go? A lot lower, because like any disruptive technology theme, they\u2019ll move in unison with the broader technology market. With the Nasdaq sitting at nearly all-time lows, a slow slide into 2023 is all but expected. If the bear market were to reach the lows seen during the pandemic panic of March 2020, the Nasdaq would need to fall 35% from today\u2019s levels. That\u2019s why we decided to only add shares of Planet (PL) if they fall 50% or more below our cost basis. For those of you who like price targets, that would be $3.45 a share. Given the 52-week low is $3.70 a share, it\u2019s realistic to think that a continuing bear market might test those levels. Today, we want to make sure we\u2019d still pull the trigger if shares fall 50% below our cost basis or more. The latest scuttlebutt comes from Planet\u2019s Q3-2023 results released several weeks ago which also provides guidance for the remainder of 2023. What\u2019s that you say? The year 2023 hasn\u2019t even started? Shush please, and just ignore the fact that Fiscal years are confusing as hell, and whoever invented this should be taken out back and shot. The takeaway is that growth is continuing on an annual basis. Planet\u2019s glossy SPAC deck promised $191 million for Fiscal 2023, while midpoint of guidance now points to $190 million. That\u2019s indicative of a competent management team that does what they say, and also addresses problems as they arise. For example, Planet provides a metrics called \u201cwinbacks\u201d which is defined as \u201ca previously existing customer who was inactive at the start of the fiscal year, but has reactivated during the same fiscal year period.\u201d Having to convince customers to return to a solution they stopped using isn\u2019t a very big vote of confidence for the value proposition. That said, props to the management team for having the cojones to admit there was a retention problem, and actively address it with ongoing metrics. As for the most popular SaaS retention metric, net recurring revenues, that sits at 123% which is about where a typical SaaS firms ought to be.  Today\u2019s macroeconomic headwinds will make the Fiscal 2024 revenue target of $289 million \u2013 representing 50% growth year-over-year \u2013 a real challenge. Any disappointments will likely cause the share price to react accordingly, which could represent a buying opportunity. The only concern would be whether Planet can survive until they\u2019re able to start generating positive operating cash flow. Like most software-as-a\u2013service (SaaS) business models, their gross margin is expanding as they scale. With $425 million on the books and a burn rate of around $45 million a quarter, they have several years remaining before more cash will need to be raised through issuing more shares or raising debt. Overall, the company appears to be on track, and they\u2019ve even added some missing metrics that we had asked for the last time we checked in. We\u2019ve had quite the debate with readers about whether Planet Labs or Maxar (MAXR) would be the leader in geospatial imaging. We\u2019ll be losing visibility into the latter given Maxar will be acquired by private equity firm Advent. The other four companies to watch in the geospatial intelligence space are all SPACs with market caps under $1 billion (company names link to our most recent research piece on each company). We have a strict rule about not investing in any company with a market cap under $1 billion, but for those with more tolerance for risk, here\u2019s a quick look at how these geospatial intelligence companies have been faring. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $2.34 million primarily from the selling of our imagery to a single customer in an over-time revenue recognition arrangement. Evaluate companies for long enough and red flags start to become intuitive. Long shareholder updates that amount to nothing tangible, a single customer, and lots of prospects in places like Albania, are the kiss of death for companies playing follow the leader. Satellogic still hasn\u2019t managed to achieve meaningful revenues yet, and until they do, there\u2019s no point in wasting any time analyzing the company\u2019s prospects. Investors were expecting $114 million in 2022, but BlackSky\u2019s latest guidance points to just $66 million on the upper end of guidance. At least now they\u2019re managing to sell a service for more than it costs to produce. While last year their cost of goods sold (COGS) exceeded revenues, this year they\u2019ve been decreasing COGS while increasing revenues, with 82% of total revenues coming from U.S. federal government and agencies. We don\u2019t invest in companies that have such a heavy reliance on any single government because they have little leverage at the negation table. BlackSky has $88 million remaining on their books and $73 million in debt with a burn rate averaging around $35 million a year. Spire investors will be quick to point out that they\u2019re doing something different from Planet. Fine, but they\u2019re still classified under \u201cgeospatial intelligence.\u201d The company has about $100 million in cash remaining, while revenue growth is far from what investors were promised \u2013 $114 in 2022 according to the glossy SPAC deck. Here\u2019s how that\u2019s going: Full year revenue guidance remained between $80 to $82 million, after Spire lowered guidance last quarter from original 2022 guidance of between $85 million to $90 million.  Investors should hold management teams accountable for missing their estimates by a country mile. Maybe that\u2019s why the stock price has sunk like a rock. With $82 million left on the books, and $21 million burned through last quarter, Spire has about a year\u2019s worth of runway before they\u2019ll need to raise more money by selling their beaten-down shares or adding to the $100 million in debt on their books. Should the bear market continue through 2023, then companies like Spire \u2013 and even BlackSky \u2013 may see their depressed share prices lead to a risk of being demoted to over-the-counter status which would significantly inhibit their ability to raise capital. Proper institutional investors don\u2019t mess around with OTC stocks, and neither should you. Space is a risky theme, even for investors with more tolerance for risk than we have. More exposure to the theme isn\u2019t a concern given how little we have, but would we add shares of Planet were the company to fall 50% or more below our cost basis?  The company talks about this massive total addressable market of $128 billion which seems very optimistic, but even if the TAM were a 10% of that number, they\u2019ve still barely tapped into the opportunity. They claim to be the leader in geospatial intelligence, something we\u2019ve debated heavily with the Maxar advocates. Perhaps we can agree that both Maxar and Planet are leading the pack with Airbus\u2019s contributions largely an unknown apart from what industry insiders might be able to comment on.  Per our comments on \u201cwinbacks,\u201d there\u2019s a concern here about how \u201csticky\u201d the solution will be in the face of today\u2019s bear market where companies are tightening their purse strings. Does the platform add sufficient value such that customers will continue spending more through Fiscal 2024? We\u2019re optimistic given other key metrics the company provides in their recent investor deck, something we\u2019ve elaborated upon further in a YouTube video to supplement this research piece titled Best Space Stock. If we choose to add shares of Planet in the coming months, Nanalyze Premium annual subscribers will be alerted via email.  We\u2019re going to hold strictly to our rule of only adding shares if they fall 50% below our cost basis or more. Oftentimes when we set an aggressive target that seems out of reach, the market surprises us by hitting it and falling even further. If the market dumps another 20 or 30 percent in 2023, seems likely the falling tide will affect all ships. If 2023 ushers in a recovery which paves the path to the next bull market, how happy will we be?

Photo courtesy STL\n With a background in subsea and offshore, coming up with new ideas is the norm\u2019 for UK-based engineering consultancy STL (Submarine Technology Limited), writes Elaine Maslin. The last few years have been no different. The company has been focusing on ship-based robotics, including robotic arms. These aren\u2019t just any robotic arms \u2013 they\u2019re motion compensated systems for deploying/recovering people and robots to and from fixed or moving objects. That could be wind technicians to an offshore wind turbine or an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in and out of the water \u2013 all with a single arm system from a vessel. In fact, STL has developed two different systems, one for moving people to locations up to 20m above the sea surface and another, an articulated system, for launch and recovery of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and AUVs, using a remote sensing system. Andreas Fechs, project and business development manager at STL, explained both systems at the joint Society of Underwater Technology (SUT), IMCA and Hydrographic Society Scotland seminar in Aberdeen in mid-November. A key goal has been to improve the safety of and ability to access offshore structures, initially fixed structures, from ships, including those that are relatively smaller than current gangway-system based vessels, he says. But another goal is to give future uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) more capability. It\u2019s been a challenge STL has been looking into since the early 2010s, when the need for better access systems became an issue, for offshore wind, but also normally unattended oil and gas facilities. While others have now commercially introduced gangway systems, STL has been developing \u201cspace stabilisation\u201d and \u201csynchronous stabilisation\u201d. Its first concept, Neptune, got going in 2012, with government R&D funding.   The Neptune a two-part articulated arm that has been designed to be able to carry 3-4 people or 1,000 tonne of equipment up to a height of 20m above the seabed and 20m reach, with +-10cm station keeping accuracy. It weighs 12-tonne, with a 2.5m x 3m foundation footprint, and is based on a steel truss structure, \u201cFor lightness and stiffness, as they have to be mounted on to relatively small vessels, but reach up to 20m high and be moved relatively quickly,\u201d explains Andreas, allowing the system to be installed on a 36m catamaran or a 54m-long monohull. All joints, the slew-ring and the gimbal base are moved with hydraulic cylinders or motors (the HPU isn\u2019t part of the 12 tonne), because of the need for speed and accuracy, using a computer control system \u2013 software and hardware at the heart of the system \u2013 that takes in the vessel\u2019s six degrees of movement (via an IMU and GNSS), including up to 3m significant wave height. The Neptune system uses dual, high speed CAN networks for rapid data transfer between sensors, controllers and actuators.  This enables full motion compensation and station keeping accuracy. The company has developed a full-scale prototype, first tested onshore in 2017, both on a six degree of freedom ship-motion simulator STL has and on land at STL\u2019s research facility in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, using real vessel motion data as input. Andreas says a vessel-based trial of this system was planned before the end of 2022.STL\u2019s Neptune during onshore trials. Photo courtesy STL Having developed Neptune, STL decided to take the concept further. Why not a multi-axis articulated arm with more intelligence, so that USVs could do more, such as equipment transfers, survey and inspection or launch and recovery operations, from a moving object, i.e. a ship or USV, to another moving object?This is the synchronous stabilisation the company has been working on, or its Autonomous Synchronised Stabilised Platform (ASSP), that\u2019s had European Regional Development Fund through the Marine-I programme in Cornwall, where the company has another base. It adds machine vision to synchronise the payload motion with the moving target, so that, whatever motion the articulated arm is experiencing, the end of the arm has no residual motion with regard to the moving (floating) object it\u2019s synchronising with. This could be used from ships for launch and recovery of ROVs and AUVs, says Andreas. Using a remote sensing system (RSS), developed by STL, and machine vision to detect robots in the water, the arm, from a host vessel, could be used to pick them out of the water, tho this would need a latching system added to the vehicles, he says.   A critical part of this system is a \u201cRemote Sensing System\u201d (RSS), which STL had further Marine-I funding to develop. The RSS adds machine vision to the robotic control system, enabling the movement of objects of interest to be tracked relative to a known datum. This is fed into the control system so the arm can synchronise with the object, such as an AUV, ROV, another vessel or a floating wind turbine, says STL. The system was initially tested in 2020 using a ship-motion simulator and a moving target test rig, and since then there\u2019s been a demonstration at the University of Plymouth\u2019s COAST Laboratory, which has in-water testing enabling physical model testing with combined waves, currents and wind. This involved a research prototype with a three-part articulated arm. It was limited to a 100kg payload, which would support deployment of a Falcon ROV or Gavia AUV, says Andreas. \u201cBut it would be applied to any robotic crane arm,\u201d says Andreas. \u201cIt could allow ship-to-ship transfer. The geometry can be adapted to any application and heavy objects.\u201d I.e. the technology can also be applied to a bigger system such as Neptune, says STL. There\u2019s still work to be done. The machine vision for remote sensing will need to be at a point where adequate robustness and reliability offshore is demonstrated.

Using a remote sensing system (RSS), developed by STL, and machine vision to detect robots in the water, the arm, from a host vessel, could be used to pick them out of the water, tho this would need a latching system added to the vehicles, he says.  A critical part of this system is a \u201cRemote Sensing System\u201d (RSS), which STL had further Marine-I funding to develop. The RSS adds machine vision to the robotic control system, enabling the movement of objects of interest to be tracked relative to a known datum. This is fed into the control system so the arm can synchronise with the object, such as an AUV, ROV, another vessel or a floating wind turbine, says STL.The system was initially tested in 2020 using a ship-motion simulator and a moving target test rig, and since then there\u2019s been a demonstration at the University of Plymouth\u2019s COAST Laboratory, which has in-water testing enabling physical model testing with combined waves, currents and wind. This involved a research prototype with a three-part articulated arm. It was limited to a 100kg payload, which would support deployment of a Falcon ROV or Gavia AUV, says Andreas. \u201cBut it would be applied to any robotic crane arm,\u201d says Andreas. \u201cIt could allow ship-to-ship transfer. The geometry can be adapted to any application and heavy objects.\u201d I.e. the technology can also be applied to a bigger system such as Neptune, says STL.There\u2019s still work to be done. The machine vision for remote sensing will need to be at a point where adequate robustness and reliability offshore is demonstrated.\n\n",
