block 1:  Therefore, access will be controlled and measured.

This article discusses the European Commission's initiative to study the feasibility of installing data centers in orbit to reduce power consumption, pollution and carbon footprint due to exponential growth in computing infrastructures and energy expenditure which is expected to reach 10% of world consumption in 2050. Companies such as Google Cloud and Amazon have already started initiatives that use solar energy sources but their efforts may not alone be sufficient. A consortium led by Thales Alenia Space has been formed with experts from various fields who plan on assembling a modular centre using robotics while taking advantage of low temperatures in space for cooling purposes. Not only could this project help mitigate emissions before 2050 but also benefit future space exploration projects by providing necessary processing capabilities remotely without physical transportation back & forth between Earth & other planets or satellites.

Summary: The European Commission has commissioned Thales Alenia Space to study the feasibility of the ASCEND program, which involves installing data centers in space to mitigate power consumption and pollution associated with digital infrastructure. Data companies such as Google Cloud, Amazon, and other have already implemented similar initiatives but many can't. To meet this challenge, a consortium of specialists will be conducting research over the next year and a half in order to install these data centers by mid-decade.

The head of technology at Thales Alenia Space believes that it is possible to construct a completely automated and modular data center in space, using special robotics assembly and optical communication. Such centers are essential for further space exploration, increased security, and energy savings--which could potentially help reduce global emissions by over 11%.
