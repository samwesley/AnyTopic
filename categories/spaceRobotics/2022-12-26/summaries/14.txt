The United Arab Emirates recently sent a 4-wheeled rover, Rashid, to the moon as part of its space exploration program. Through collaboration with Japan and other countries, this mission marks an achievement for both domestic and foreign policy in a new era of space exploration driven by smaller nations. The mission also represents the UAE's diversification into knowledge economy through overhauling educational systems, developing research funds and creating science-oriented governmental structures.
