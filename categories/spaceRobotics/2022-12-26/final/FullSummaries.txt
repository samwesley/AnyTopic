block 4: It was the first time a pedestrian had been killed by an autonomous vehicle on a public road.The person who ultimately should be held accountable, according to some accounts, is neither the passenger nor its real-time supervisor— both of whom were in the car and thus not able to react quickly enough— but rather those further away such as Uber’s engineers and operators or even those responsible for regulating traffic?Summary: Robots have traditionally been viewed with fear and trepidation, but they are becoming more commonplace in industry today. The idea of a friendly robot companion has captured our imagination, leading to robots that can interact naturally with people, though their capabilities are still limited compared to how they appear in fiction. As robots become increasingly intelligent and autonomous there are ethical implications that must be taken into account before it's too late; including consideration of moral agency, responsibility and cross-cultural differences when granting them autonomy over decisions made involving human safety.
