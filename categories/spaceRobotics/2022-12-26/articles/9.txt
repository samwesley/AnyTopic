They also made fully robotic flies that could sniff out gas leaks and crafted lightning bugs to potentially pollinate farms in space. /Matt Stone/University of Washington This browser does not support the video element. /The Washington Post The never-ending quest to make humanlike robots saw some notable events this year. Elon Musk unveiled a prototype of Teslaâs human-sized Optimus robot that drew skepticism, bipedal machines broke speed records and Google tried to make one that could flip burgers. /The Washington Post Robot Flippy 2 works at a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant in San Diego.  Sparked by a pandemic-era labor crunch, restaurants are hiring robots to take the place of humans. They can now do tasks such as flipping fries, serving drinks and seasoning tortilla chips.

That includes this snakelike tentacle robot that slithers down your lungs and could spot cancer.

An Israeli company created a racing drone that could kill and potentially be used in urban conflict zones such as in Israel and Palestinian territories. The use of drones in war has enraged some human rights activists.
