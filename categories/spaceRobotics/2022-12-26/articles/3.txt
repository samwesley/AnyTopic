SciTech Executive Director, Faith Slowinski adds, “I am looking forward to partnering and collaborating with APS Training Academy so together we can offer robust hands-on STEM offerings together to benefit deserving Aurora families through free and affordable STEM programs." Also, part of this agreement is the sharing of space on the 2nd floor of 105 E. Galena Blvd. in downtown Aurora.  ​The APSTA also recently announced new Executive Director Kelsey Cozens, who previously served as the Program Director at APS Training Academy.  "I look forward to leading us through this exciting high growth period," Cozens said. In 2022 the Aurora STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Science) Academy, a public-private partnership between the City of Aurora, APSTA and TinkRWorks, served more than 2,200 participants in grades K-8 throughout the year, established four new Robotics teams (two elementary and two middle schools) and held 14 summer camps. To date, more than 3,000 students have been served since APSTA opened in the fall of 2021.  Here is more data regarding participants: As APS Training Academy scales to serve more learners in 2023, it is also plans to add additional staff and secure a larger space to support the rapid program growth.  A new adult industrial robotics program using FANUC robots is in the planning stages, thanks to a Kane County Riverboat Grant.
