High Rate of Adoption Of Robots For Varied Applications And Rising Investment On Research And Development Driving Market Growth 
            The service robotics market has witnessed an upsurge in its adoption, reasons being high labor cost, increased investments in R&D, growing awareness about the benefits of service robots, lack of skilled workforce, and increased demand for automation among professional and personal sectors. With the introduction of new technologies like swarm intelligence, robots can efficiently perform varied, complex tasks. For instance, swarm intelligence allows drones to cover a larger area faster since the Internet range can be extended by sharing the Internet among the drones. Due to such benefits, market growth is projected to spike during 2018-2028. 
Inaccurate Results and Concerns Over Data Privacy Coupled with Data Security Inhibiting Market Growth in Critical Operations 
            Robots are finding applications in critical sectors, such as medical surgeries, bomb diffusion, security, and assistance for senior citizens, but they cannot be programmed for all possibilities. Robots can undergo technical issues, such as viruses in programs or loss of internet connectivity while performing a critical operation. Moreover, there remains a possibility of accidents due to faulty circuits and batteries. It is a major challenge in drones to improve accuracy to prevent collisions with moving objects while changing directions recurrently. Larger flying birds, such as eagles, can, for instance, attack and catch drones. As a result, drones should be able to detect such obstructions from a considerable distance in order to avoid an accident. 
            Furthermore, drones can be easily affected by strong winds and weather conditions, affecting accuracy. The second big issue that circumcircles the service robotics sector are the ethical issues of data privacy and data security. The valuable information stored in the service robots can be encroached upon and misused. The repercussions of such breach can be immense in areas like the defense sector and healthcare sector, thereupon hampering the growth rate of the global service robotics market.

Software Component Of Service Robotics Market Expected To Grow With A Higher Growth Rate 
            The global service robotics market can be segmented into hardware and software based on the component. Although in 2021, the component-wise growth rate of the hardware component was higher, it is estimated to change drastically in the coming years as the deployment of service robots is inclined towards becoming more application-specific. For instance, an AGV programmed for swarm operation on a factory floor can also be programmed for food delivery. Great advancements have been made in the software of robotic vacuum cleaners, with features including live floor mapping and remote activation via integration with voice assistants. Hence, the software market is expected to grow at a higher CAGR than that of hardware during the forecast period. 
Impact of COVID-19 on the Service Robotics Market 
            The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global value and supply chains that had a disastrous effect on the global service robotics market, especially during the early phases of the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. But with time, the market is coping, and the pandemic has necessitated contactless delivery of goods and services, which has only boosted the demand for service robotics. They are finding application in multitudinous sectors, especially the healthcare sector, with several hospitals launching robot nurses to aid and guide the COVID patients. Service robots have also helped fight the COVID-19 pandemic as they have been used in the rescue operations for contactless delivery of food, medicines, etc.
