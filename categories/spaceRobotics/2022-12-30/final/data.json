          "Who decides how hybrid work will take place? In many cases, it won\u2019t be the CEO \u2014 it will be the \u201ctop talent\u201d of the company.  That\u2019s according to Raj Choudhury, an economist from Harvard Business School.   Throughout history, it has always been the most sought-after job candidates who have shaped what our jobs look like and how work gets done, says Choudhury.  In our current pandemic-era state of flux, it will likely be these influential people who will once again steer the future of work toward their ideal scenario.  Interestingly, this is not just a desire for hybrid work. Instead, it\u2019s about working from wherever they want.  \u201cThere are two kinds of companies,\u201d Choudhury said. \u201cOne is going to embrace work-from-anywhere, and the second is in denial\u2014I feel those companies will lose their workforce.\u201d   He believes that the \u201ccompanies that are trying to drag back time will lose some of their best talent, and that dynamic will force these companies to catch up.\u201d  Hybrid work has already cemented itself as the future of work. But if Choudhury is right, we could soon see another shift toward a work environment with even less location dependence.  \nJo is Allwork.Space's Senior Editor for the UK and Europe.

          "Hybrid modalities and virtual and augmented reality integration will most likely be widely used in future coworking spaces. According to research published in Service Business in 2022, \u201cdynamic capabilities\u201d are central to coworking operations.  Dynamic capabilities are the ability to sense threats and seize opportunities for business or creative operations.   Coworking spaces are dynamic environments because knowledge workers from all walks of life come together to work alongside each other and with others.  Ideas and issues of unpredictable sorts and magnitudes are constantly arising in coworking spaces.   COVID-19 and how coworking spaces modified themselves during the pandemic has, and will continue to, directly impact their dynamic capabilities in the future. It\u2019s already clear that coworking is now considerably different from pre-COVID coworking.   Service Business researchers studied how coworking spaces reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how these reactions will impact the future of the coworking industry.   To see what dynamic capabilities will be like in the future, we need to see what they are like during rare and impactful times of change, such as global pandemics.  During the pandemic, the coworking industry learned that community input and feedback were indispensable for proper coworking space management operations.   Community input was particularly helpful in generating alternate uses of coworking spaces and online substitutes for physical spaces.    During the pandemic the coworking industry shifted more dramatically to a community-centric mindset, taking advantage of community feedback to create tools to effectively manage events.  Having a close reciprocal relationship between management and community proved wise for management teams to give society and staff members a more significant say in coworking operations.   When massive changes occur, everyone should work together in good faith to help coworking spaces adapt \u2014 not just managers, but communities, too.  As Service Business researchers point out, involving community members \u201cin all the transformative steps during the pandemic\u201d led to significant customer loyalty and engagement.    The close reciprocal relationship between coworking communities and managers will surely continue in the future of coworking given these benefits. Much like it was during the pandemic, input presented by the coworking communities will be tried and then used if it proves successful.   That\u2019s all it really means to develop dynamic capabilities \u2014 it is fundamentally the ability to adapt effectively to change.   So what do these dynamic capabilities look like in practice?  One of the outcomes of the recent shifts in operations is that hybrid spaces will become far more common in the coworking space in the future.   This is primarily because the definition of \u201cspace\u201d has been expanded to include digital spaces and other alternative spaces used in physical events \u2014 like virtual reality.   According to Service Business, the two primary dynamic capabilities for the coworking industry are (1) strong community and (2) hybrid modalities.  In this context, strong community dynamics involve sharing resources and actively participating in processes that occur when coworking spaces make generalized changes in the face of the future.   Operators can use services such as SurveyMonkey to get data from coworking members to make decisions based on current events and their effects on the coworking market.   Hybrid modalities and virtual and augmented reality integration will also be used in future coworking spaces. Most scientists believe COVID was a dress rehearsal for future pandemics, so remote tools for work will always be one of coworking space\u2019s adaptive features.   Other non-pathogen-related events are likely to also require hybrid adaptation in the future, too. Climate change, for example, has already made some regions less inhabitable, displacing more and more people. California wildfires are an excellent example of this, as the fires have led some Californians to move out of state without necessarily leaving their job because remote options allow that flexibility.    As the global market becomes more interconnected, coworking spaces can become international hubs for communication, networking, and sharing resources for business growth.  \nDaniel has been freelance writing for over 3 years now.

          "\n NASA is considering the possibility of using a private spacecraft to extend the life of the Hubble Space Telescope. Space.com reports that on Dec. 22, the space agency issued a Request for Information regarding a study conducted by SpaceX earlier this year that explored how the telescope could be \"rebooted\" into a higher orbit. Since the start of its operations in 1990, the orbit of the Hubble Space Telescope has been decaying, and raising it to a higher, more stable orbit could add years to its operating lifetime. In the past, NASA used space shuttles to restart the telescope during servicing missions. However, the space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011, and NASA currently has no plans to operate or fund a new servicing mission for the telescope. Read Also: SpaceX Starlink's Weirdest Facts: Open-Source Linux OS and Other Peculiar Things About the Satellite A SpaceX study was made to help NASA figure out if it would be possible to use a commercial spacecraft to extend the life of the Hubble Space Telescope and how hard it would be to do so technically. The fact that the study is non-exclusive means that other companies can propose their servicing studies using different rockets or spacecraft. These studies will collect data from the Hubble Space Telescope and SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to assess the possibility of safely rendezvousing and docking with the telescope before shunting it to a higher, stable orbit. The studies are expected to take around six months to complete. NASA has issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking interest in demonstrating commercial capabilities to re-boost the orbit of a satellite. NASA is considering utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for a demonstration in the coming years and is seeking partners to participate in the mission on a no-exchange-of-funds basis. Should NASA decide to pursue the demonstration, the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) will provide technical information and consultation with HST experts to facilitate rendezvous, docking, and reboost. All other resources, like the launch vehicle, spacecraft, crew (if needed for the approach), and mission operations (except for HST operations during the mission), will be provided by partners. If successful, the operation to boost the Hubble Space Telescope would demonstrate how older satellites and spacecraft could be given extended operating lives, especially those in near-Earth orbits. It would also be fun to show how NASA is trying out new ideas through partnerships with the private sector. The HST, which has been in low-Earth orbit since its launch in 1990, is predicted to reach an altitude of 500 km in approximately 2025, at which point rendezvous may become more complex. Without reboosting, the HST is predicted to reenter the Earth's atmosphere in the mid-2020s. To extend its mission and continue producing outstanding science, NASA is seeking partners with demonstrated capabilities to support a concept of operations for conducting a restart demonstration. Responses to the RFI are expected to include a description of the technical approach, the length of the docked period, the number of burns, and the amount of boost expected, as well as an assessment of the risk to the HST and the likelihood of success. Partners must be based in the United States. Stay posted here at Tech Times.

Chance of rain 100%. Rainfall near a quarter of an inch.  Updated: December 30, 2022 @ 5:13 pm   Concord High School students offered demonstrations for the public about robotics during the open house event celebrating the completion of the Concord Engineering and Construction Center Dec. 12. ELKHART \u2014 A new learning area will provide Concord High School students interested in the engineering, robotics, and construction trades fields a space to learn work readiness skills matching industry demands \u2014 and develop skills that will support their future careers. Construction was recently completed on the Concord Engineering and Construction Center, a 10,400-square-foot building located on the west side of Concord High School in an area that was previously used for school bus parking. A community open house and ribbon cutting ceremony took place Dec. 12. The facility includes innovative engineering, robotics and construction trades spaces to support future-ready learning, support the local economy, and prepare students for success. This facility was designed in response to the needs of the local economy, including the desire for students to enter the workforce with industry-ready skills. The project cost was approximately $3.9 million and was paid for through the sale of a bond and will not raise taxes. \u201cWe are proud to support this investment that will have a direct impact on our students and their ability to increase their industry-ready skills while still in high school,\u201d Superintendent Dan Funston said. \u201cIn conversations with local industry leaders, it is clear that having this facility in place to support student learning will set them on a path to success in whatever career path they choose.\u201d In recent years, student interest in the high school\u2019s construction trades offerings has more than tripled, with more than 500 students enrolled in courses for the fall semester. This increased demand for course offerings has outgrown the existing facility. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have so many students interested in career fields that will directly benefit our local community,\u201d Concord High School Principal Seth Molnar said. \u201cThere is an excited buzz among our students and staff as we prepare to launch classes here in January, and we know that momentum will continue to grow as more students and families become aware of these incredible learning opportunities.\u201d Courses to be offered in this space include civil engineering, architectural engineering, manufacturing, robotics, design and innovation, and construction trades. Future plans include a competitive robotics program, additional student-designed projects available for purchase by the community, the growth of partnerships with Habitat for Humanity and other local organizations, and work-based learning placement for students with local contractors. Students will begin utilizing the space in January 2023. Concord would like to thank Weigand Construction and TMP Architecture for their partnership on the project.

          "It's a big day for students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia: A science project they designed is now in outer space. A satellite built by the young scholars launched from the International Space Station early Thursday morning. The students there are familiar with the mantra \"shoot for the stars,\" and the ones who are part of the space program are constantly brainstorming ways to advance scientific research into the cosmos. Their latest project builds on the thinking of former TJHS students. \"What they initially wanted to do was send up a little radio module and test whether that works,\" said Nikhil K., the project manager for \"TJ Reverb.\" Current students decided to expand upon that question. Their mission allows them to create an improved satellite radio. The hope is that the students will be able to communicate with the space station while the device is in outer space. \"Because the radio communicates with a satellite constellation instead of a ground station, we can draw a lot less power than more traditional radios,\" said Alan H., another student who worked on the project.  The radio they designed and built launched from the ISS on Thursday morning. Their curiosity and dedication has led to NASA partnerships and grants, not to mention an unforgettable experience. \"The fact that we're a high school making [the satellite] and sending it into space, is motivational not just for us but for other high schoolers around the country, other groups that are trying to reach this point,\" said Kareem J., electronics lead for the project. And it's just the beginning of the program, which already has its sights set on the next space mission -- and training the next generation of engineers. \"We've really kind of tried to put together a program,\" said Kristen Kucko, robotics lab director at the school. \"So that way high school students can have this opportunity to experience what it's like to work in the aerospace industry before ever getting into the aerospace industry.\"",

          "The Robot Report By Brianna Wessling | December 29, 2022 In 2022 we saw big movements in the robotics industry, from high-profile lawsuits to big acquisitions to exciting new robots and deployments, there was no shortage of news to cover this year.  Here are the top 10 most popular stories on The Robot Report in 2022. Subscribe to The Robot Report Newsletter or listen to The Robot Report Podcast to stay updated on the robotics stories you need to know about. Early this year, Amazon unveiled its first-ever autonomous mobile robot (AMR) Proteus. The company first entered the mobile robot space in 2012, when it acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million. Kiva Systems offered automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that have been at work in Amazon\u2019s warehouses since. Read More  Boston Dynamics is suing competitor Ghost Robotics for patent infringement. Boston Dynamics claims Ghost Robotics infringed on seven patents related to its Spot quadruped robot. According to the complaint (PDF) filed in Delaware federal court, Boston Dynamics said Ghost Robotics\u2019 Vision 60 and Spirit 40 quadrupeds both contain infringing capabilities. Read More  Boston Dynamics has landed the first customer for its Stretch case-handling robot. DHL Supply Chain is spending $15 million with Boston Dynamics to further automate warehouses in North America. Boston Dynamics will deliver a fleet of Stretch robots to multiple DHL warehouses throughout North America over the next three years. Read More  Ghost Robotics has responded to the patent infringement lawsuit recently filed by Boston Dynamics. Earlier this year, we learned that Boston Dynamics is suing competitor Ghost Robotics for allegedly infringing on seven patents related to the former\u2019s Spot quadruped robot. Filed in Delaware Federal court on November 11, 2022, Boston Dynamics takes issue with both Ghost Robotics\u2019 Vision 60 and Sprint 40 quadrupeds. Read More  Yes, you read that headline correctly. There is a new Intel RealSense depth camera on the market. The Intel RealSense D405 Depth Camera ($259) is a short-range stereo camera that the company said provides sub-millimeter accuracy. The Intel RealSense D405 Depth Camera is designed for robotics applications that require \u201cclose-range depth sensing.\u201d Read More Earlier this year, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Perseverance rover landing on Mars. It touched down on Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021, and is searching for signs of past life on Mars. During its journey, Perseverance is also taking some incredible images of Mars. Below are some of the more memorable photos taken by Perseverance over the past year. Read More NASA released the first science image from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) during a press conference with US President Joe Biden. The image was of SMACS J0723.3-7327. What you see in the image is an area of space that includes the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared. This slice of the vast universe covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm\u2019s length by someone on the ground. Read More  Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai) announced the launch of the Boston Dynamics AI Institute. Hyundai and Boston Dynamics are making an initial investment of more than $400 million to make fundamental advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and intelligent machines. The institute will be led by Marc Raibert, founder of Boston Dynamics. Read More Since it was unveiled as part of the Avengers Campus on June 4, 2021, Disneyland\u2019s Spider-Man robot has successfully performed its stunts countless times. On June 9, 2022, however, robot Peter Parker momentarily lost its Spidey-Sense. The Spider-Man robot failed in mid-air and crashed into the W.E.B. facility that is part of the stunt setup. And it was all caught on video. You can watch the incident below. Read More  RoboTire announced that it\u2019s installed and started operating its system at a Discount Tire in Fountain Hills, Arizona. The system can replace four tires on a passenger vehicle in less than 25 minutes. At the Discount Tire, the RoboTire System will remove, lift and install tire and wheel assemblies. RoboTire hopes that its system will reduce technician injuries that can be caused by repetitive heavy lifting. Read More Brianna Wessling is an Associate Editor, Robotics, WTWH Media.

Nor could he sit in the aisles without awkwardly blocking the way. So he adapted. It\u2019s a regular part of his new life with limited mobility that requires near-constant calculations of how to navigate a world no longer set up for him. That included his longtime church in Camden, Tennessee \u2013 one of the many U.S. houses of worship with accessibility limitations. Instead, on Sundays, he worshipped in the narthex at the back of Camden First United Methodist Church, separated from the rest of the congregation, with his family at his side in folding chairs. It didn\u2019t really bother Lamb, 66, who \u201cwas already over it,\u201d having struggled to walk since 2019 due to a worsening spine condition. But it bothered the Rev. Adam Kelchner, the new pastor: \u201cI was preaching one Sunday and was rather distraught that one of our families literally could not be in the same worship space just because we didn\u2019t have a seating arrangement that made sense.\u201d So Kelchner made one that did. He secured trustees' approval and hired a company to cut up a few pews, making space for Lamb -- and anyone else using a wheelchair or walker \u2013 to worship alongside the rest of the congregation. \u201cIt blew us out of the water,\u201d said Lamb. Except as employers, religious entities are exempt from the Americans with Disabilities Act, the 32-year-old landmark civil rights law that included access requirements for public spaces. Nonetheless, most have made their buildings accessible in some fashion. But there is much room for improvement, said Scott Thumma, a sociology of religion professor and director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research. Thumma also co-leads Faith Communities Today, a research project that surveyed more than 15,000 U.S. religious congregations for its 2020 report and found that 76% have wheelchair access. Thirty percent offer large-print worship materials and about the same portion have hearing assistive devices. \u201cThat\u2019s not terrible. But then when you start to ask the questions of how are they accommodating all the other challenges and disabilities? \u2026Then it just almost drops off,\u201d Thumma said. \u201cThey don\u2019t make the full accommodations to allow all of their people to actually worship to their fullest in the service.\" The pandemic and the sweeping rise of online worship that followed was a catalyst for a more expansive understanding of what it really means to be an accessible church, said the Rev. Kelly Colwell, who leads digital and hybrid ministry at First Congregational Church of Berkeley, United Church of Christ, in California. She had an eye-opening virtual coffee chat early in the pandemic. A congregant with multiple sclerosis explained how her online event-packed calendar finally allowed her to participate in ways her physical condition wouldn't otherwise permit. It made Colwell realize the church had been excluding people with accessibility challenges all along. Today, Colwell continues to assess whether the church is physically accessible to all congregants on an equal basis. Now she also considers how to make the online and hybrid experience meaningful. \"We\u2019re not providing a sort of separate and unequal service for people who can\u2019t come in person,\" Colwell said. Maria Town, the American Association of People with Disabilities' president and CEO, has seen progress. She pointed to congregations adding inclusion events and playgrounds for all as well as an activist-created, easy-to-read Quran translation for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. \"It\u2019s slow, but I do think more and more entities are beginning to realize that this is a need, and I also hope that more and more people with disabilities are actually saying, 'We deserve to be here,'\" Town said.

Lamb wants to invite policymakers to what he thinks would be an eye-opening outing in wheelchairs. They would experience firsthand just how hard it is to do basic activities, like using public bathrooms and finding restaurants with enough space between tables for a wheelchair, he said. His family also sacrificed what they thought was their forever home to move into a fully accessible house.

          " NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) \u2014 Jerry Lamb could not maneuver his wheelchair into the rows of pews at his church. It wouldn\u2019t fit.
