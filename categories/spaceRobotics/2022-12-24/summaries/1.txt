Can Space-Based Solar Power Really Work? Pros and Cons
• Space-based solar power is a technology that uses satellites in space to collect solar energy, then transforms it into microwaves or lasers, and sends it back down to Earth.
• The potential benefits of this technology include providing an alternative clean energy source with no location restrictions, increased output during times when sunlight is unavailable such as night time or cloudy days and the ability to generate electricity outside the atmosphere.
• Potential drawbacks include high startup costs due to launch costs, difficulties transmitting large amounts of electricity over long distances without losses in efficiency, environmental concerns related to debris being generated by launches into orbit on a large scale basis, as well as potential interference with communications systems on Earth. 
• Overall conclusions state that while space-based solar power could potentially be viable if technical issues can be addressed; further research and development are needed for this technology before its full capabilities can be realized.
