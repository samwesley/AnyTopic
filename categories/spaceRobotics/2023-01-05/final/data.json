          "By: ABP News Bureau | Updated at : 05 Jan 2023 06:10 PM (IST) \n    Edited By: radifahk \n\n The space-tech startups that have been identified by ISRO will be boarded onto the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub platform, as part of the collaboration.  ( Image Source : Getty ) The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Microsoft have collaborated to support space-tech startups in India. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Thursday, January 5, 2023, to fuel the growth of Indian space-tech startups and empower them with technology tools and platforms, mentoring and go-to-market support. This will help them scale up and become enterprise ready.  What is the aim of the collaboration? The aim of the collaboration is to strengthen ISRO's vision of harnessing the market potential of the most promising space tech innovators and entrepreneurs in India, a statement released by Microsoft says. The space-tech startups that have been identified by ISRO will be boarded onto the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub platform, as part of the collaboration. This platform supports startups and entrepreneurs at every stage of their journey, from idea to unicorn, and provides them with technology and tools.  Indian Space Congress 2022 and Microsoft\u2019s partnership In October 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the 'iDEX 75 Space Challenges' during the Defence Expo, to encourage and promote space-tech startups. Engaging with this initiative, the Indian Space Congress 2022 (ISC 2022), in October, partnered with Microsoft to extend the benefits of Founders Hub to 15 shortlisted startups.  How will the Founders Hub Programme benefit startups? As part of the Founders Hub programme, the 15 selected startups can avail up to $1,50,000 worth of free Azure credits. Azure is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform that provides a broad range of cloud services including computing, analytics and networking.  As part of the Microsoft for Founders Hub programme, space-tech startup founders in India will have free access to the tech tools and resources they need to build and run their business,  including technical support to build and scale on Azure, access to smart analytics, and developer and productivity tools including GitHub Enterprise, Visual Studio Enterprise and Microsoft 365.

Visual Studio Enterprise is an integrated development environment from Microsoft, and is used to develop computer programs including websites, web applications, web services and mobile apps.  Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub will provide startups access to smart analytics with Power BI, a platform used to find insights within an organisation's data, and is a collection of software services and apps, and Dynamics 365, a portfolio of intelligent business applications that delivers superior operational efficiency and breakthrough customer experiences. At the second session of ISC 2022 held on October 27, five finalists of space tech startups pitched their ideas to industry leaders and investors. These startups include Blue Sky Analytics, Vellon Space, Delta-V Robotics, Astrogate Labs and GeneX Space. They presented their pitches at the 'Pitch Right for Skyrocketing Startups' session. The startups will get the opportunity to enrol in a specially curated mentorship engagement with senior executives of leading companies. What ISRO Chairman says about the collaboration? Quoting ISRO Chairman S Somanath, the Microsoft statement said ISRO's collaboration with Microsoft will greatly benefit space-tech startups in their analysis and processing of vast amounts of satellite data for various applications, using \"cutting-edge\" methods like AI, machine learning and deep learning. He added that the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub is a useful platform for bringing together startups and providers of technology solutions to support the national space technology ecosystem. How the collaboration will benefit space-tech startups Microsoft will not only provide access to technology, but will also provide mentoring support to space-tech entrepreneurs in areas ranging from space engineering to cloud technologies, product and design, fundraising and sales and marketing, the statement says.  Also, founders will have access to Microsoft Learn, a platform which will provide them with training content and programs to help them build connections with the industry and potential customers.  Together, ISRO and Microsoft will organise knowledge sharing and thought leadership sessions for the startups with space industry experts, and support founders with opportunities to sell their solutions through Microsoft channels.

          "Along with its gaming-focused laptops and models that offer 3D visuals without the need for glasses, ASUS had some upgraded general-purpose systems to show off at CES. Depending on how you spec them, though, the likes of Elden Ring should still look pretty great on these laptops. First up is the latest Zenbook Pro 16X OLED, which ASUS says is the most powerful Zenbook to date. You'll be able to kit it out with up to a 13th-gen Intel Core processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40-series laptop GPU and 32GB of LPDDR5X DRAM. ASUS says the Zenbook Pro 16X OLED (UX7602BZ) has a \"unique\" Intel processor and a Supernova System-on-Module design that reduces the size of the motherboard core area by 38 percent, allowing for more efficient cooling. There's also more space for the graphics unit's power components, which ASUS says will deliver higher and more stable GPU performance.Turn on browser notifications to receive breaking news alerts from EngadgetYou can disable notifications at any time in your settings menu.Not nowTurn onTurned onTurn on As the name suggests, this model has an OLED display. It's a 16-inch, 3.2K HDR touchscreen with an aspect ratio of 16:10 and a 120Hz refresh rate. There's an auto-tilting keyboard that could help you to find the ideal typing angle. You'll also be able to take advantage of the ASUS Dial, which should offer more precise control in creativity-focused apps. The Zenbook Pro 14 OLED is getting a glow up too. The UX6404 model has a 2.8K, 120Hz NanoEdge Dolby Vision display with a 100 percent DCI-P3 gamut and Pantone validation for accurate colors. It comes with up to a 13th-gen Intel Core processor, a GeForce RTX 40-series laptop GPU, a 2TB SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM. There's a memory slot that can accommodate up to 32GB SO-DIMM, as well as WiFi 6E connectivity and a 76Wh battery. ASUS says it packed all of this into a body that weighs 3.64 lbs (1.65 kg) and is less than 0.7 inches (1.8 cm) thick. As for the Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404), that has a 14.5-inch, 2.8K HDR display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop comes with up to a 13th-gen Intel Core processor, GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD and a 70Wh battery. The thin and light 14X comes in two colors, Inkwell Gray and Sandstone Beige. The latter has a lid with what ASUS describes as \"a new ecofriendly Plasma Ceramization coating technique that creates a ceramic-like finish and stone-like feel.\" Meanwhile, the business-oriented ExpertBook B9 OLED (B9403CVA) is an all-metal laptop. The company claims the \"ecofriendly manufacturing process helps to reduce production materials by up to 29 percent, and shortens manufacturing time by up to 75 percent to maximize energy efficiency.\" It's said to be lighter than most 13-inch laptops too. The latest ExpertBook B9 has a 14-inch 2.8K display with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. There's a touchpad that's almost 27 percent larger than the previous model and you can expect a raft of security features, including NFC login, face login and a physical webcam shutter. ASUS hasn't revealed pricing for any of these models as yet. The laptops should start shipping between April and June.

          "Robot delivery firm Ottonomy has unveiled a new Ottobot model called the Yeti with a new automated package delivery mechanism. That could allow it to do last mile drop-offs directly to a locker or remove the need for someone to receive a package, TechCrunch has reported.  As shown at the end of Ottonomy's latest video, the Yeti uses a simple tilting mechanism and rollers to dispense the packages. That would allow it to drop packages onto a doorstep or transfer them to a locker, making it fully independent from humans. It may also allow for easy returns, as TechCrunch noted.  The Brooklyn-based firm operates in multiple cities including Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Oslo and Madrid, with plans to expand across north America and Asia. It recently unveiled the Ottobot 2.0 with modular delivery bins, a navigation engine that merges data from lidar and cameras, and a new four-wheel drive \"crab mode\" system for extra maneuverability in tight spaces. The company works in partnership with Verizon in the US.

          "Robotics has emerged as a transformative force in the business world, with an increasing number of companies in a variety of sectors turning to automation to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase productivity. In this context, the use of robots has become more widespread, and it is expected that this trend will continue in the coming years. In 2020 alone, the warehouse robotics market was valued at around $3.56 billion, and it is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8%, reaching a value of approximately $10.86 billion by 2030. The U.S. market is expected to be at the forefront of this growth, with a leading position in the adoption and deployment of warehouse robots. One of the primary advantages of robotics is its ability to automate tasks that are repetitive, hazardous, or time-consuming. This can significantly reduce labor costs and enhance operational efficiency for businesses. For instance, robots can be utilized to handle materials, assemble products, and conduct inspections, enabling human workers to focus on more complex and value-adding tasks. Startups are playing a crucial role in driving innovation within the robotics industry, developing new technologies and approaches that are advancing the field and making it more attainable and affordable for businesses. These companies are working on creating robots that are more adaptable and capable of functioning in unstructured environments, as well as robots that are user-friendly and easily programmable, making them suitable for a wide range of applications and industries. Here are 3 key players in the innovation of the robotics space: Established in 2021, 1MRobotics aims to revolutionize last-mile fulfillment through the development of robotic nano-fulfillment centers.

With a wealth of cumulative experience in enterprise sales, hardware and software development, robotics, and electro-optics, 1MRobotics brings a diverse and cross-functional background to the creation of its next-generation dark stores. The company\u2019s founders have a track record of success in the establishment and growth of various businesses, including experience in mergers and acquisitions. ANYbotics is a Swiss robotics company that is at the forefront of the development of autonomous mobile robotics. The company\u2019s walking robots are capable of navigating and operating in challenging infrastructure, beyond the scope of traditional, purpose-built environments. Founded in 2016 as a spin-off from the renowned robotics laboratories at ETH Zurich, ANYbotics is a rapidly expanding team of over 90 employees who are dedicated to revolutionizing industries through the use of robotics technologies. The company\u2019s customer base includes prominent international energy, industrial processing, and construction firms.

Thanks to the new Low Profile WireClips, wire-to-board solutions with their ultra-flat installation height of 2.5mm can be realised. The space-saving and highly economical clips are furnished with ready-to-connect cable assemblies that provide process- and function-safe contacting of individual strands and wires on the PCB. Wherever absolute reliability of the cable connection and a space-saving solution is needed, such as in industrial automation and the automotive industry, the assemblies have demonstrated their value. The technology now provides a cost-efficient and space-saving wire-to-board solution with ready-to-connect cable assemblies with minimal installation height. The patented clips comprise a specially designed plastic part with integrated snap-in board lock. The individual strands, which have been twisted and tin-plated in a special manufacturing process beforehand, are inserted into this component, angled and cut to size in a device. The solution is available as 90-degree variants and in straight versions, and special designs, such as, overmoulded variants. The new Low Profile WireClips have now been added, further reducing the space requirement compared to the standard single-row version. Compared to alternative solutions, the space-saving is significantly greater. The current portfolio includes three-pin and four-pin versions for AWG22 (0.35 mm\u00b2) stranded wires. In line with the strapline 'Fitting Your Application', the company can also supply customised assemblies with different numbers of pins and other wire cross-sections with a customer-oriented time-to-market in its toolmaking department. \n\n\n Information Manage newsletter Our apps Social profiles All news & general enquiries:",

          "Microsoft plans to collaborate with the Indian space agency to give Indian space tech startups free access to cloud tools, the two said Thursday, the latest in the U.S. tech giant\u2019s attempts to deepen its ties with young firms in the South Asian market. As part of a memorandum of understanding that Microsoft has signed with the Indian Space Research Organization, the firm will also provide space tech startups with go-to-market support and help them become enterprise ready, it said. Startups handpicked by ISRO will be onboarded to Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub platform, where they will receive free access to several tools and resources. These tools include help with building and scaling on Azure, as well as GitHub Enterprise, Visual Studio Enterprise, Microsoft 365 and Power BI and Dynamics 365. \u201cISRO\u2019s collaboration with Microsoft will greatly benefit space tech startups in their analysis and processing of vast amounts of satellite data for various applications, using cutting-edge methods like AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning,\u201d said S Somanath, Chairman of ISRO, in a statement. \u201cThe Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub is a useful platform for bringing together startups and providers of technology solutions to support the national space technology ecosystem. We are pleased to work together to assist and support entrepreneurs, to in turn benefit the Indian economy as a whole.\u201d Indian space tech startups are having a moment. In June 2020, the Indian government passed the space sector reforms and established the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe) to allow private companies to use ISRO\u2019s infrastructure. The government also set up NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) as the commercial arm of the space agency to work closely with private companies and startups. In November last year, ISRO successfully launched the Vikram-S after much anticipation in a boost to the private sector. The Vikram-S, developed by four-year-old startup Skyroot Aerospace, is a single-stage, spin-stabilized solid-propellant rocket with a mass of around 550 kilograms. It carries three customer payloads, including one from a customer outside India. The South Asian nation has 111 space startups registered on the In-SPACe platform, per an official response shared in the upper house of the country\u2019s parliament in December. While startups such as GIC-backed Skyroot Aerospace and Rocketship.vc-invested Agnikul are into developing launch vehicles, Blume Ventures and Lightspeed Partners-backed Pixxel and ANIC-ARISE and Kalaari Capital-invested Digantara are building satellites. Indian space startups raised over $245.35 million, with $108.52 million infused in 2022 alone, according to the data shared by the Indian Space Association (ISpA) with TechCrunch. Microsoft has made scores of announcements in India this week as chief executive Satya Nadella visits the South Asian market. The company said earlier this week that HDFC Bank and Yes Bank have signed up to use Azure and other Microsoft cloud services.",

          "Starbucks is continuing to take an employee-light approach as tensions between labor unions ramp up.   The coffee-chain giant is turning to automation that will take the place of many in-store tasks.  Incoming CEO Laxman Narasimhan will lead the transition to a more automated coffee shop, taking the power away from employees seeking higher wages and more benefits.  Starbucks isn\u2019t alone in this shift, either. Many other companies such as McDonald\u2019s and Target have incorporated their own form of automation as demand for higher pay runs concurrently with high inflation.  While this is great for efficiency, workers must make their own moves in order to stand apart in the future of work.  This could mean reskilling to learn how to work alongside automated technology, or upskilling to fit into the new positions that will be inevitable in a modern workplace.  \nAayat is an editor for the Daily Digest based in Lexington, Kentucky.

          "After failing to meet the deadline of turning a profit during its first year as a public company, WeWork is becoming home to short sellers.  Short sellers refer to investors who borrow securities, sell it on the market and eventually buy it back for a lower price, an effort to profit from a stock\u2019s losses.   Shorts that make up more than 10% of a firm\u2019s shares suggest a relatively pessimistic view of the economy. For WeWork, investors held short positions on over 27% of the company\u2019s shares as of December 15 \u2014 a grim sign for the coworking firm.    WeWork went public in October of 2021, and has since continued to burn through cash. While the company has made attempts to right-size its business by closing underperforming locations, investors are skeptical of the operator\u2019s profit timeline.   \u201cRight now all [investors] see is WeWork promised three times to hit its break-even goal and push that out,\u201d said Vikram Malhotra, an analyst at Mizuho.  Although its reputation has somewhat been mended since going public, experts have expressed concern over whether WeWork can weather the worsening economy.  \nAayat is an editor for the Daily Digest based in Lexington, Kentucky.

          "Katherine Martinko is an expert in sustainable living. She holds a degree in English Literature and History from the University of Toronto. NASA/JPL-Caltech \nIf and when human beings take our first steps on the rusty soil of the Red Planet, we will be greeted by something extremely familiar: our own trash. \n \nIn an article published in The Conversation last fall, Cagri Kilic, a postdoctoral research fellow in robotics at West Virginia University, calculated that there were at least 15,694 pounds of debris left on Mars from previous missions. \n \n\u201c[W]e managed to leave debris on a planet where we haven\u2019t been to yet,\u201d Kilic tells Treehugger. \u201cThe number is kind of interesting.\u201d\n \nKilic studies how to track the rovers that humans send to the moon and Mars, which are the missions ultimately responsible for the human debris left on the celestial bodies. He says Martian debris usually takes one of three forms:\n \nKilic reached his number by calculating the mass of all the spacecraft humans have launched to Mars\u2014around 22,000 pounds\u2014and subtracting the 6,306 pounds of currently active spacecraft to come up with 15,694 pounds. \n \nIn an email to Treehugger, he clarifies a few points about this number that had been misreported elsewhere. The figure represents mass, not weight, as an object\u2019s weight depends on the gravity of the planet it finds itself on. Further, it doesn\u2019t include all the human trash on Mars, such as orbiters or landing debris. \n \n\u201cHere is an example to make this clearer,\u201d Kilic tells Treehugger. \u201cThe mass of the Opportunity rover is 185 kilograms (approximately 408 pounds), the backshell and parachute are approximately 210 kilograms (approximately 463 pounds), the heat shield is approximately 80 kilograms (approximately 176 pounds), and the lander is 348 kilograms (approximately 767 pounds).\u201d\n \nThat comes to 1,406 pounds from just one spacecraft landing that was not included in Kilic\u2019s calculation.  \n \n\u201cSo the total mass of the space junk is actually much more higher\u201d than 15,694 pounds, Kilic says.\n \nFor just the inactive spacecraft included in this number, Kilic isn\u2019t sure junk, waste, or trash is the best word. \n \n\u201c[T]hese might be better considered historical relics than space junk,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe one day humankind can visit their location and see the pioneering efforts on the planetary exploration.\u201d\n \nThere is a certain symbolic weight to the mere fact of human debris on Mars, but does it actually pose a problem?\n \nThere are two potential challenges that debris from past missions could present for future ones. \n \nOne is contamination. On December 21, Perseverance deposited its first sample tube filled with Martian dirt to be collected for study by a future mission, as NASA announced. The concern is that human debris could potentially end up in samples like these collected by the rovers, though Kilic says that this is an issue the scientists involved have planned for.\n \n\u201cAll the space agencies are doing more than their best to reduce the risk of contamination,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the issue on the possibility of the contamination on Mars, even though there is no immediate concern, Perseverance sampling teams are documenting the debris and checking to see if it may pose a potential contamination source for the sample tubes.\u201d\n \nAnother potential risk is entanglement from the discarded entry/descent/landing (EDL) gear. \n \n\u201cThese scattered small debris can travel with Martian winds and may entangle to the robots,\u201d Kilic explains.\n \nThis is what might have happened with the pieces of Perseverance\u2019s thermal blanket. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise finding this here: My descent stage crashed about 2 kilometers away,\u201d the robot tweeted of the discovery. \u201cDid this piece land here after that, or was it blown here by the wind?\u201d\n \nHowever, Kilic also notes that NASA has determined the risk of such entanglements to be low. \n \nOverall, Kilic thinks that there is relatively little debris on Mars given humanity\u2019s 50 years of exploration there. This is not the case on the moon, where the amount of debris is much higher. Then there\u2019s the case of the space junk orbiting the Earth.\n \n\u201cSpace trash is a problem,\u201d Kilic says. \u201cThere are many reasons why it is a problem: It is a problem because orbital debris can collide with or damage other orbiting systems, including [the] International Space Station.\u201d\n \nThe Department of Defense\u2019s global Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors are currently monitoring more than 27,000 pieces of so-called \u201cspace junk\u201d or orbital debris\u2014around 23,000 of which are larger than a softball, according to NASA. Beyond this, there are many more pieces that are too small to be tracked but still pose a risk to spacecraft because they travel at speeds of up to 17,500 miles per hour. \n \n\u201cEven tiny paint flecks can damage a spacecraft when traveling at these velocities,\u201d NASA says.\n \nLike the Martian debris, orbital debris usually comes from previous missions and includes defunct spacecraft, jettisoned stages from launch vehicles, and related materials. In one example of the havoc such junk can cause, a defunct Russian spacecraft crashed into a U.S. Iridium commercial spacecraft on February 10, 2009. The resulting collision sent more than 2,300 pieces of trackable trash into orbit.\n \nMore missions to Mars will no doubt lead to more debris on that planet, but, despite the extent of the litter both on and around the Earth, Kilic is optimistic about our species\u2019 capacity to learn from the past as we reach for the stars.\n \n\u201cI feel that humankind will not do the same mistake that we had done for our planet, Earth,\u201d he says.\n \"Space Debris and Human Spacecraft.\" NASA.

He says Martian debris usually takes one of three forms:\n\n\n\nAbandoned hardware: This debris spreads when the protective module built around a spacecraft is jettisoned as it lands. The landing gear can sometimes break up and travel; for example, NASA\u2019s Perseverance Mars Rover spotted a piece of the thermal blanket from its descent stage sticking up out of the Martian sand in June.\nInactive spacecraft: There are nine spacecraft left over from previous Mars missions\u2014the Mars 3 lander, the Mars 6 lander, the Viking 1 lander, the Viking 2 lander, the Sojourner rover, the Beagle 2 lander, the Phoenix lander, the Spirit rover, and the Opportunity rover.\nCrashed spacecraft: Not all spacecraft land safely and go on to conduct their missions. There are at least two crashed spacecraft on Mars and four that lost contact with Earth before landing.\n\n\n\nKilic reached his number by calculating the mass of all the spacecraft humans have launched to Mars\u2014around 22,000 pounds\u2014and subtracting the 6,306 pounds of currently active spacecraft to come up with 15,694 pounds. \n\n\n\nIn an email to Treehugger, he clarifies a few points about this number that had been misreported elsewhere.

          "In-space transportation startup Impulse Space will head to orbit aboard a SpaceX rideshare mission later this year, as it seeks to prove out its orbital maneuvering and servicing technology for the first time. While there\u2019s always major pressure before an inaugural demonstration, there will likely be more eyes on Impulse\u2019s mission than usual. That\u2019s not least because the startup is headed by Tom Mueller, SpaceX\u2019s former head of propulsion, a formidable engineer who led the development of the Merlin engine that powers the Falcon 9 rocket \u2013 the very rocket Impulse will use to reach space. Impulse has also raised a notable amount of capital \u2013 including $20 million from Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund and $10 million from Lux Capital \u2013 and has swelled to about sixty employees, with nearly a third joining in the past six months. To top it all off, the company announced last summer that it was teaming up with Relativity Space for a very ambitious mission to Mars \u2013 yes, Mars \u2013 as early as 2024. But before Mars, Impulse will first send its first orbital service vehicle to space to test its propulsion, payload delivery and hosting, software, communications, and maneuvering capabilities. That spacecraft, called Mira, will hitch a ride on SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-9 rideshare mission in the fourth quarter of this year, the company announced today. \u201cOur vehicle has more capability than is typical,\u201d Mueller said. For context, Impulse is targeting a Delta-V of 1,000 meters per second at 300 kilograms. The company hasn\u2019t decided how long Mira will spend in space, but it\u2019s planning on demonstrating atmospheric re-entry at the end of mission life. The company is currently signing the primary payload customer and is soliciting additional customers, though they don\u2019t intend on filling up capacity for this first mission. Designing Mira hasn\u2019t been without its difficulties. Minimizing the mass of the chassis has been the company\u2019s biggest challenge, Mueller said. It\u2019s a particularly important metric as every gram sent to space has a dollar amount attached to it \u2013 and that dollar amount can add up quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s six dollars a gram to fly,\u201d Mueller said, referring to SpaceX Transporter mission costs. \u201cEven though SpaceX has brought the cost of access so quickly down, that low cost is still six dollars a gram.\u201d Mueller described Mira as a \u201cstepping stone\u201d \u2013 he likened it to SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 1, the precursor to the Falcon 9 \u2013 to future orbital vehicles Impulse is planning. Those future vehicles will be capable of considerably more propulsive capability, which means the ability to move more mass in the space \u2013 like what might be required for in-space manufacturing or space habitats. Those markets don\u2019t exist yet, Mueller said, but this mission, dubbed LEO Express-1, will nevertheless inform these future aspirations. Data from LEO Express-1 will also be useful for the future Mars mission. Both missions will use the same thrusters; they\u2019ll also utilize the same propellants and some components, as well as the same guidance and control systems and other software. Mueller acknowledged that the 2024 target was tight, particularly on the launch vehicle side. Relativity Space said it would use its heavy-lift Terran R rocket for the Mars mission, but it has yet to even fly its smaller Terran 1. If the companies don\u2019t make 2024, they\u2019ll have another opportunity two years later. In addition to preparing for the LEO Express-1 mission and the Mars mission, Impulse is also gearing up to move into a new building that will give the company a 700%+ footprint increase. So far, the company has been working out a 7,000 square-foot building in El Segunda, California, one that only has 24 parking spots for 60 employees. (Mueller joked that people were riding bikes and carpooling to compensate.) But next month, they\u2019ll be moving into a 60,000 square foot space. Plenty of room to grow for a startup that continues to move fast.",

          "UPDATE: The Transporter-6 mission successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on January 3. In January 2023, the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPP) is poised to launch into orbit a prototype, dubbed the Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD), which will test several key components of an ambitious plan to harvest solar power in space and beam the energy back to Earth. Space solar power provides a way to tap into the practically unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space, where the energy is constantly available without being subjected to the cycles of day and night, seasons, and cloud cover. The launch, currently slated for January 3, represents a major milestone in the project and promises to make what was once science fiction a reality. When fully realized, SSPP will deploy a constellation of modular spacecraft that collect sunlight, transform it into electricity, then wirelessly transmit that electricity over long distances wherever it is needed -- including to places that currently have no access to reliable power. A Momentus Vigoride spacecraft carried aboard a SpaceX rocket on the Transporter-6 mission will carry the 50-kilogram SSPD to space. It consists of three main experiments, each tasked with testing a different key technology of the project: An additional fourth component of SSPD is a box of electronics that interfaces with the Vigoride computer and controls the three experiments.  SSPP got its start in 2011 after philanthropist Donald Bren, chairman of Irvine Company and a lifetime member of the Caltech Board of Trustees, learned about the potential for space-based solar energy manufacturing in an article in the magazine Popular Science. Intrigued by the potential for space solar power, Bren approached Caltech's then-president Jean-Lou Chameau to discuss the creation of a space-based solar power research project. In 2013, Bren and his wife, Brigitte Bren, a Caltech trustee, agreed to make the donation to fund the project. The first of the donations (which will eventually exceed $100 million) was made that year through the Donald Bren Foundation, and the research began. \"For many years, I've dreamed about how space-based solar power could solve some of humanity's most urgent challenges,\" Bren says. \"Today, I'm thrilled to be supporting Caltech's brilliant scientists as they race to make that dream a reality.\" The rocket will take approximately 10 minutes to reach its desired altitude. The Momentus spacecraft will then be deployed from the rocket into orbit. The Caltech team on Earth plans to start running their experiments on the SSPD within a few weeks of the launch. Some elements of the test will be conducted quickly. \"We plan to command the deployment of DOLCE within days of getting access to SSPD from Momentus. We should know right away if DOLCE works,\" says Sergio Pellegrino, Caltech's Joyce and Kent Kresa Professor of Aerospace and Professor of Civil Engineering and co-director of SSPP. Pellegrino is also a senior research scientist at JPL, which Caltech manages for NASA. Other elements will require more time. The collection of photovoltaics will need up to six months of testing to give new insights into what types of photovoltaic technology will be best for this application. MAPLE involves a series of experiments, from an initial function verification to an evaluation of the performance of the system under different environments over time. Meanwhile, two cameras on deployable booms mounted on DOLCE and additional cameras on the electronics box will monitor the experiment's progress, and stream a feed back down to Earth. The SSPP team hopes that they will have a full assessment of the SSPD's performance within a few months of the launch.  Numerous challenges remain: nothing about conducting an experiment in space -- from the launch to the deployment of the spacecraft to the operation of the SSPD -- is guaranteed. But regardless of what happens, the sheer ability to create a space-worthy prototype represents a significant achievement by the SSPP team. \"No matter what happens, this prototype is a major step forward,\" says Ali Hajimiri, Caltech's Bren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering and co-director of SSPP. \"It works here on Earth, and has passed the rigorous steps required of anything launched into space. There are still many risks, but having gone through the whole process has taught us valuable lessons. We believe the space experiments will provide us with plenty of additional useful information that will guide the project as we continue to move forward.\" Although solar cells have existed on Earth since the late 1800s and currently generate about 4 percent of the world's electricity (in addition to powering the International Space Station), everything about solar power generation and transmission needed to be rethought for use on a large scale in space. Solar panels are bulky and heavy, making them expensive to launch, and they need extensive wiring to transmit power. To overcome these challenges, the SSPP team has had to envision and create new technologies, architectures, materials, and structures for a system that is capable of the practical realization of space solar power, while being light enough to be cost-effective for bulk deployment in space, and strong enough to withstand the punishing space environment. \"DOLCE demonstrates a new architecture for solar-powered spacecraft and phased antenna arrays. It exploits the latest generation of ultrathin composite materials to achieve unprecedented packaging efficiency and flexibility. With the further advances that we have already started to work on, we anticipate applications to a variety of future space missions,\" Pellegrino says. \"The entire flexible MAPLE array, as well as its core wireless power transfer electronic chips and transmitting elements, have been designed from scratch. This wasn't made from items you can buy because they didn't even exist. This fundamental rethinking of the system from the ground up is essential to realize scalable solutions for SSPP,\" Hajimiri says. The entire set of three prototypes within the SSPD was envisioned, designed, built, and tested by a team of about 35 individuals. \"This was accomplished with a smaller team and significantly fewer resources than what would be available in an industrial, rather than academic, setting. The highly talented team of individuals on our team has made it possible to achieve this,\" says Hajimiri. Those individuals, however -- a collection of graduate students, postdocs, and research scientists -- now represent the cutting edge in the burgeoning space solar power field. \"We're creating the next generation of space engineers,\" says SSPP researcher Harry A. Atwater, Caltech's Otis Booth Leadership Chair of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science and the Howard Hughes Professor of Applied Physics and Materials Science, and director of the Liquid Sunlight Alliance, a research institute dedicated to using sunlight to make liquid products that could be used for industrial chemicals, fuels, and building materials or products. Success or failure from the three testbeds will be measured in a variety of ways. The most important test for DOLCE is that the structure completely deploys from its folded-up configuration into its open configuration. For ALBA, a successful test will provide an assessment of which photovoltaic cells operate with maximum efficiency and resiliency. MAPLE's goal is to demonstrate selective free-space power transmission to different specific targets on demand. \"Many times, we asked colleagues at JPL and in the Southern California space industry for advice about the design and test procedures that are used to develop successful missions. We tried to reduce the risk of failure, even though the development of entirely new technologies is inherently a risky process,\" says Pellegrino. SSPP aims to ultimately produce a global supply of affordable, renewable, clean energy.
