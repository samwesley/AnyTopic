Yaoki is expected to be flown to the lunar south pole on board Intuitive Machines’ Nova-C lunar lander in the second half of 2023. After landing, Yaoki is expected to deploy from Nova-C to demonstrate Dymon’s lunar mobility technology designed by its Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Shin-ichiro Nakajima.
 
The agreement with Dymon leverages Intuitive Machines’ Lunar Access Services and Lunar Data Services business segments to land the Yaoki rover on the Moon and control it via secure lunar communications.
 
“The commercial demand for lunar access is growing with each of Intuitive Machines’ four planned missions,” said Steve Altemus, Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Intuitive Machines. “The addition of Dymon’s Yaoki rover is another critical step towards Intuitive Machines participating in the creation and definition of the lunar economy.”

(Nasdaq: IPAX, IPAXU, IPAXW) (“Inflection Point”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, that is expected to result in Intuitive Machines becoming publicly listed.
