inflatable sculpture uses soft robotics to mimic breathing
  MIT student Mateo Fernandez uses soft robotics to create an inflatable sculpture that visualizes breathing. ‘Searching for a Pulse’ is an anthropomorphic machine that is engineered to imitate a living organism or a pulsating organ. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the kinetic structure operates with soft robotics to mimic dynamic pulsations speculating a future ran by ‘breathing machines’. The fabricated skeleton sets up a 3D-printed ribcage of firmly conjoined polygonal frames through which inflatable soft material expands and contracts. all images courtesy of Mateo Fernandez       The anthropomorphic machine acts as a pulsating organ pressing against its ribcage while simultaneously being the ventilator providing it with air through a series of tubes. ‘The slow cadence of air fluctuating through the machine mimics that of a patient on a hospital gasping for air, every time less and less and less’, shares the designer. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the Covid pandemic in our rear mirror, the object seeks to project the past of a world shut down by a pandemic through breathing onto its speculative future, a world dictated by breathing machines. ‘Air is the substrate that ties everything together’, adds Fernandez.  an inflatable sculpture visualizes breathing through robotic kinesis the anthropomorphic structure operates with soft robotics to mimic dynamic pulsations     the fabricated skeleton sets up a 3D-printed ribcage of firmly conjoined polygonal frames the inflatable sculpture operates as a breathing machine inflatable soft material expands and contracts through conjoined polygonal frames the machine acts as a ventilator providing air through a series of tubes      project info:   name: Searching for a Pulse designer: Mateo Fernandez video: Jabari     designboom has received this project from our DIY submissions feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here.   edited by: christina vergopoulou | designboom a diverse digital database that acts as a valuable guide in gaining insight and information about a product directly from the manufacturer, and serves as a rich reference point in developing a project or scheme.
