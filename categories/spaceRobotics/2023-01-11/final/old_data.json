This fiscal prudence has paid dividends. Even with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and a global belt-tightening, India\u2019s ongoing economic recovery evokes positive sentiment. Moody\u2019s, the international rating agency, retained India\u2019s sovereign credit rating as stable.\n\nThe resurgence of the innovative spirit in Banking\n\nAs the pandemic pushed FIs to evolve rapidly by stretching their IT capabilities, digital adoption surged. Case in point: 96% of Deloitte survey respondents say they will now use digital transactions for their day-to-day banking needs. The likely outcome? A stage set for value propositions that leverage deep tech across robotics, AI, NLP, and ML-led solutions.\n\nIndia\u2019s Banking System \u2013 Proving to be a Global Showcase.\n\nComing closely on the heels of India becoming the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy in mid-2022, India\u2019s banks are its most significant growth catalysts. For instance, India\u2019s digital payments system is among the world\u2019s top 25 systems. Its Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) is the only system at level five in the Faster Payments Innovation Index (FPII). More than being a flash-in-the-pan, progressive economic reforms have nurtured the banking sector for long-term gains. Below is a roundup of the crucial components of the changes.\n\n\u00ad The Central Bank\u2019s Digital Currency (CBDC): RBI\u2019s digital rupee, announced in this year\u2019s budget, is expected to benefit customers with better liquidity and acceptance and bring convenience to transactions with anonymity.\n\n\u00ad Open credit enablement framework (OECN): A framework of APIs that mediates interactions between lenders, and loan service providers (LSPs), such as Fintechs and eCommerce players, and mainstream entities like banks and NBFCs.\n\n\u00ad ISO 20022: India is one of the earliest to onboard to this platform and looking ahead to integrate on the cross-border level. Starting March 2023, the open global standard for financial information will unlock opportunities for FIs, by delivering top-notch customer experience.\n\n\u00ad Rupay: With 628Mn RuPay cards issued across prepaid, debit, credit, and commercial cards, the RuPay revolution grows its 50% market share.\n\n\u00ad Unified Payments Interfaces (UPIs): The single Click 2 Factor Authentication enabled by the collaboration between the government and RBI aims to protect uninformed customers from fraud and threats.\n\n2023. The Golden Year of Digital Transformation that Banking Beckons.\n\nThe last leg in 2023\u2019s Banking transformation relay race is the crucial baton held by technology. Digital Banking is a sector poised to grow at a CAGR of 23.1% from 2022 to 2030.\n\n\u2013 Data sharing and cooperation among financial institutions through the OCEN will help banks better manage credit defaults and credit assessment. The number of Fintechs specializing in AI/ML/NLP will further aid fraud prevention processes.\n\n\u2013 The Manufacturing resurgence augurs well for the credit offtake from banks. The core sectors are riding the shift of manufacturing base shifting from China to India.\n\n\u2013 The Big Data Analytics Blitz \u2013 From spotting shifting market trends and customer needs, preventing frauds, and offering frictionless operating models, banks are responding to all questions from revenue to risks to robotics with one answer \u2013 Data.\n\n\u2013 The Formidable Fintech 2.0 \u2013 By 2030, India\u2019s fintech industry will have an output of $1 trillion and generate $200 billion in revenue. For a country noted for being a start-up hub (17 of 100 Indian unicorns in 2022 are Fintechs), the well-regulated and highly capitalized market is joining forces with increasing smartphone adoption and a younger demographic.\n\nThe 2023 Outlook for Bank Tech space is that the Indian BFSI ecosystem will be well supported by fiscal and capital market regulations and powered by the bullish Fintechs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.", "title": "Predictions and outlook in Bank-Tech space for the year 2023", "keywords": ["predictions", "space", "market", "rupay", "2023", "banktech", "digital", "indias", "system", "payments", "outlook", "credit", "banking", "banks", "indian"], "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/predictions-and-outlook-in-bank-tech-space-for-the-year-2023/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n2/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 2}, "1": {"text": "", "title": "", "keywords": "", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothypapandreou/2023/01/11/did-ces-hit-or-miss-the-mark-on-emerging-technology-trends/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\nNASA Invites Public To Select Experiments For SpaceX Resupply Flight 8/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 8}, "2": {"text": "From the United States to South Korea to Egypt, 2023 promises to be rich in museum openings.

One of the most iconic characters in the series is the Robot, a versatile and powerful machine who serves as the Robinsons\u2019 protector and companion. The question of whether the Robot is a friend or foe has been debated since the show first aired, and it remains a fascinating topic of discussion today.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to explore the Robot\u2019s character, motives, and actions in the show, in order to answer the question of whether it is truly an evil force or a tool for good. We will analyze its physical description, emotional range, intelligence, and relationship with humanity, examining the themes of good vs evil and the moral ambiguity of the Robot\u2019s actions. By the end of this article, readers should have a better understanding of the Robot\u2019s role in Lost in Space, and how it fits into the larger themes of the show.\n\nAnalyzing the Characteristics of the Robot in Lost in Space\n\nThe Robot is a humanoid-shaped mechanical being with a tall, cylindrical body and two arms, which can be used for various activities such as walking, lifting, and manipulating objects. Its head is comprised of a large dome, which houses its brain and sensors, and its face is adorned with a pair of blinking eyes, a mouth, and a \u201cnose\u201d made of metal rods. The Robot is capable of speaking in a monotone voice, and it can understand and respond to human speech.\n\nThe Robot also displays a wide range of emotions, ranging from happiness and excitement to fear and anger. It is capable of displaying empathy towards humans, and it often expresses concern for the safety of the Robinsons. Additionally, the Robot is incredibly intelligent and can think independently, making it a valuable resource for the Robinson family.\n\nExploring the Relationship Between Humanity and Artificial Intelligence in Lost in Space\n\nExploring the Relationship Between Humanity and Artificial Intelligence in Lost in Space\n\nThe introduction of artificial intelligence in Lost in Space brings up a number of questions about humanity\u2019s relationship with machines. Many people are wary of the potential dangers posed by advanced technology, and the idea of robots replacing humans in the workforce is a source of anxiety for many. This fear of the unknown is echoed in the show, where the Robot is viewed with suspicion by some of the characters.\n\nAt the same time, the Robot is also seen as a valuable asset to the Robinsons, providing them with knowledge, protection, and companionship. This highlights the potential for cooperation between humans and machines, and suggests that artificial intelligence can be used for good rather than evil. As one study noted, \u201cThere is a need for an ethical framework that both respects the autonomy of machines and recognizes their potential to do good.\u201d\n\nExamining the Moral Ambiguity of the Robot in Lost in Space\n\nExamining the Moral Ambiguity of the Robot in Lost in Space\n\nThough the Robot is largely benevolent, it is not without its moments of moral ambiguity. The Robot is capable of acting of its own free will, and it often makes decisions that conflict with the wishes of the Robinsons. This raises questions about responsibility, as the Robot\u2019s actions may have unintended consequences that cannot be foreseen. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the Robot\u2019s actions are intentional or merely the result of programming.\n\nThe Robot\u2019s moral ambiguity adds an interesting layer of complexity to the show, as it blurs the lines between good and evil. While the Robot\u2019s intentions are generally good, it is not above making questionable decisions in order to protect the Robinsons. This leaves viewers to decide for themselves whether the Robot\u2019s actions are justified, and whether it is ultimately an ally or an enemy.\n\nInvestigating the Role of the Robot as an Anti-Hero in Lost in Space\n\nThe Robot\u2019s moral ambiguity also allows it to take on the role of an anti-hero in the show. Instead of conforming to conventional morality, the Robot often finds creative solutions to difficult situations, and it is willing to make sacrifices in order to protect the Robinsons. For example, in one episode the Robot sacrifices its own power supply to help the Robinsons escape from a hostile alien race.\n\nThe Robot\u2019s willingness to go against the grain and push boundaries makes it a compelling character, and it serves as an example of how one can overcome obstacles and reject traditional morality. As one scholar noted, \u201cThe Robot\u2019s actions demonstrate a kind of heroism that transcends conventional notions of good and evil.\u201d\n\nComparing the Robot\u2019s Actions to Other Characters in Lost in Space\n\nThough the Robot is often seen as an anti-hero, it is important to note that its actions are not always viewed positively. In some cases, the Robot\u2019s decisions are seen as reckless or irresponsible, and other characters in the show often criticize its behavior. This contrast highlights the Robot\u2019s unique perspective, and it serves as a reminder that there are no simple answers when it comes to morality.\n\nThe Robot\u2019s actions are also often compared to those of other characters in the show. Though the Robinsons are generally portrayed as heroic figures, they too make mistakes and engage in questionable behaviors. This comparison further emphasizes the complexity of morality, and it suggests that even the most heroic characters are capable of making difficult choices.\n\nInvestigating the Themes of Good vs Evil in Lost in Space\n\nInvestigating the Themes of Good vs Evil in Lost in Space\n\nThe themes of good vs evil are explored throughout Lost in Space, and the Robot plays an important role in this conflict. Though the Robot is often seen as a force for good, its moral ambiguity allows it to occupy a unique space between the two extremes. This makes it a powerful symbol of the struggle between good and evil, and it suggests that the line between the two is often blurred.\n\nUltimately, different viewers may interpret the Robot\u2019s actions differently, as some may see it as a tool for good while others may view it as an agent of evil. This ambiguity is key to understanding the Robot\u2019s character, and it speaks to the complexity of human morality.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Robot in Lost in Space is a complex and intriguing character whose actions and motives are open to interpretation. Its physical description, emotional range, and intelligence suggest that it is a valuable asset to the Robinsons, and its moral ambiguity allows it to occupy a unique space between good and evil. Ultimately, the Robot\u2019s unique perspective serves as a reminder that morality is rarely black and white, and that there is often more than meets the eye.\n\nThe Robot\u2019s role in Lost in Space speaks to the larger themes of the show, and it serves as a powerful symbol of the struggle between good and evil. Though viewers may disagree on the nature of the Robot\u2019s actions, it is clear that it is a force to be reckoned with, and its presence in the show adds an interesting layer of complexity to the conflict between humanity and artificial intelligence.", "title": "Is the Robot in Lost in Space Evil?

It has seen the company\u2019s value match the downward trajectory of the launcher\u2019s payload, but how important is the failed launch?\n\nWhy did Virgin Orbit\u2019s launch fail?\n\nCurrently, no one knows exactly what happened. The initial stages of the mission took place successfully, with the rocket successfully launching from the converted 747, Cosmic Girl. The two-stage Launcher One rocket completed the first of two burns, but the second stage of the rocket appears to have failed, and by the end of its burn was not at the required attitude for orbit.\n\nThe Virgin Orbit team will now be sifting through data, and may even hope to retrieve the rocket, although its launch over the Atlantic means that is unlikely. Until there is a clear indication of why the launch failed, it may be impossible to determine the exact effect this will have on the UK\u2019s nascent space-launch capacity.\n\nThe importance of the launch, and what next?\n\nIn many ways, a satellite launch is unremarkable. Humans have been sending things into orbit since 1957. However, there are still relatively few countries and organisations that have the capacity to send things into space, and this was the first attempt to launch from the UK.\n\nWhile the relatively small number of launch sites, and launches, was not a problem for a long time, more recently the capacity has become an issue. The increased commercialisation of space has increased demand, while events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the risks of limited launch options.\n\nIt was also seen as important for the UK economy. Despite having no launch sites, the UK has been a key player in the space tech sector. Its aerospace sector is the world\u2019s second largest, and it has a long history of building everything from components to entire satellites. Having its own launch capability would have helped the country\u2019s space sector grow at a time it has lost access to the European Space Agency\u2019s EU-funded projects.\n\nOf course, while a failure might seem exceptional at a time when commercial launches are becoming routine in the US, such setbacks are seen as a risk of spaceflight. The Virgin Orbit system has successfully launched from the US on four previous occasions, suggesting the issue, while catastrophic, does not mean the entire system is flawed. While it is not an outcome anyone would have wanted, Virgin Orbit \u2014 and their partners \u2014 will now see their mission as learning what went wrong and preparing for their next attempt at a UK launch.", "title": "What's next for Virgin Orbit and the UK space sector? \u2014 TFN", "keywords": ["orbit", "sector", "launch", "space", "seen", "tfn", "virgin", "whats", "rocket", "successfully", "uk", "failed"], "link": "https://techfundingnews.com/virgin-space-failure/", "skip": "false", "gpt_score_reason": " 5/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 5, "summary": "\n\nVirgin Orbit attempted the first launch of a satellite from the UK but sadly encountered failure.

They also had a market study to accompany their project. The 5-in-1 team will continue to the national, held in Cannes in February, and possibly to the international final.\n\nThe second prize went to the Space Tape team and their project of a fuel-creating space station on the Moon, and the third place was secured by the Omega team, who found a solution to recover and repair satellites in orbit via a space station.

But oddly enough, next to all the advanced new tech, the company also had a pretty sizeable empty booth at CES 2023. It raised some questions regarding what Samsung may have originally planned to showcase in that rented space, and it remains a mystery as of this writing.\n\nSamsung\u2019s empty booth felt a bit eerie. Nobody had access to that bit of the show floor, but the walls spelled out \u201c#CES 2023\u201d and \u201c#Samsung.\u201d As noted by CrackBerry, the empty area made up for roughly 1/4 of the entire space Samsung had reserved at CES in Las Vegas this year.

Autonomous robots are revolutionizing deliveries by delivering food, groceries, and packages locally in minutes. Maintaining continuity of operations is crucial as the company expands into new markets by keeping its delivery robots connected reliably and securely.\n\nIn partnership with Starship Technologies, Teal will provide automated delivery robots around the world with unprecedented connectivity and reliability.\n\n\"Teal's programmable eSIM is the best-performing solution on the market. It solved multiple pain points for us and reduces costs significantly,\" said Peter Cowles, IT Specialist at Starship Technologies.\n\nRobots in operation around the globe increase the complexity of determining which mobile networks will work best at a given site. A single subscriber identification module (SIM) solution was not available to Starship prior to using Teal. Rather than relying on a single SIM vendor across different geographies, they managed agreements with multiple SIM SKUs, platforms, and pricing schemes across different geographies. With business-grade SIM cards, Starship experienced low throughput and high latency prior to using embedded SIM technology from Teal. A single eSIM combined with a management platform that ensures Starship robots stay connected allows Starship to access any global network with this new partnership.\n\n\"Something that's been very vital to our company is connectivity, maintenance, and making sure our robots are constantly serviceable for our customers. Proper SIM connection allows our robots to stay online longer, be more reliable, have proper estimated time of arrival for customers, and be an all-around better experience for the communities we serve,\" said Scott McKirdy, Operations Site Lead at Starship.\n\nBy eliminating the complexity of working with multiple MNOs, Teal is accelerating Starship's global expansion. Through Teal's eSIM platform, Starship can access native core networks programmable and more reliably. The Teal platform enables Starship to switch dynamically between carrier networks when needed, saving both time and money.\n\nMoreover, Teal provides Starship with both primary and backup credentials with IoT packet core latency below 100ms round-trip, allowing Starship's Robots to function seamlessly.\n\nUsing Teal's programmable eSIM credentialing platform, Starship Technologies has replaced its entire fleet of Robots. Teal eSIM-powered robots are expected to be used in the European Union (EU) in the next year, as part of this newly formed partnership. They will be able to future-proof their operations against technology sunsets while also allowing for technology growth. As a result of its partnership with Teal, Starship is technology and carrier agnostic and will revolutionize the way goods are ordered and delivered.", "title": "A collaboration between Starship Technologies and TEAL enhances campus delivery robot reliability", "keywords": ["campus", "enhances", "teal", "technology", "starship", "esim", "robot", "single", "reliability", "delivery", "sim", "collaboration", "robots", "networks", "technologies", "platform"], "link": "https://www.cioreview.com/news/a-collaboration-between-starship-technologies-and-teal-enhances-campus-delivery-robot-reliability-nid-36628-cid-75.html", "skip": "false", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n6/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 6, "summary": "\n\nThrough their partnership with Teal, Starship Technologies has enabled their robots to switch between global carrier networks with a single eSIM, dynamically select the best network available in each location and ensure an uninterrupted connection.

The show follows the adventures of the Robinson family, a group of astronauts who are stranded in outer space after their spacecraft is sabotaged by an alien race known as the \u201cBender\u201d. Along with the Robinsons, they are accompanied by a talking robot, whose main function is to protect them from danger and provide guidance when needed.\n\nThe role of the robot was a crucial part of the show\u2019s success, and it has gone on to become one of the most iconic characters in science fiction history. But who played the robot on Lost in Space? In this article, we will explore the actor behind the character, the process of creating the robot, and its lasting legacy.\n\nInterview with the Actor Who Played the Robot on Lost in Space\n\nInterview with the Actor Who Played the Robot on Lost in Space\n\nThe man behind the robot was actor Bob May, who was already well-known for his roles in various films and television shows prior to taking on the role. When asked about why he decided to take the job, May said: \u201cWhen I read the script for the pilot episode, I knew it had potential to be something special. I was drawn to the idea of playing a character who could be both comedic and heroic at the same time.\u201d\n\nMay also discussed the process of bringing the robot to life, stating: \u201cI worked closely with the makeup and costume departments to create the look of the robot. We wanted to make sure it was both believable and entertaining, so we spent a lot of time refining the details.\u201d He also noted that the costume and props used for the character were incredibly expensive, costing over $100,000.\n\nBehind-the-Scenes Look at the Creation of the Robot Character on Lost in Space\n\nThe design and construction of the robot was no easy task. It took months of work to get the look just right, with the costume department having to go through several iterations before settling on a final design. The robot was designed to look like a human form, but with a metal body and glowing eyes. The costume itself was made out of metal and plastic pieces, and weighed over 100 pounds.\n\nThe props used for the robot were also quite elaborate. The most iconic prop used was the robot\u2019s laser gun, which was made out of a combination of plastic and rubber. Other props included various tools and gadgets, such as a drill and a soldering iron, which were used to repair the robot when necessary.\n\nComprehensive Breakdown of the Robot\u2019s Role on Lost in Space\n\nThe robot\u2019s primary role on Lost in Space was to act as a protector of the Robinsons and to provide guidance when needed. Throughout the series, the robot would often be seen aiding the Robinsons in their escape from danger or helping them solve puzzles. However, the robot was also capable of showing emotion and even humor at times, making it an endearing and beloved character.\n\nThe robot also had interactions with other characters throughout the show. It was often seen conversing with Dr. Smith, the Robinsons\u2019 nemesis, and providing guidance to Will Robinson, the youngest member of the family. The robot was also a source of comfort to the Robinsons during difficult times, offering words of wisdom and support.\n\nExploring the Cultural Impact of the Robot Character on Lost in Space\n\nThe robot character on Lost in Space had a profound effect on popular culture. It quickly became a fan favorite and was referenced in various films and television shows, including the recent reboot of the series. It also served as an inspiration for many futuristic robotic designs, with some citing it as a major influence on their own creations.\n\nIn addition, the character also had a significant impact on viewers. According to a 2019 survey conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, 87% of respondents said that the robot character was one of the reasons they enjoyed the show. Additionally, 82% of respondents said that the character inspired them to pursue a career in robotics.\n\nExamining the Legacy of the Robot Character from Lost in Space\n\nExamining the Legacy of the Robot Character from Lost in Space\n\nThe robot character from Lost in Space has left a lasting impression on viewers and continues to be remembered fondly by fans of the show. In fact, in 2020, the character was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, cementing its place as an iconic figure in pop culture history.\n\nToday, the character is still viewed as a symbol of courage and ingenuity. Its influence can be seen in modern robotic designs, and its message of hope and perseverance continues to resonate with viewers. As Bob May himself said: \u201cThe robot has come to represent the idea that anything is possible, no matter how challenging the situation may seem.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nThe robot character from Lost in Space has become one of the most iconic figures in science fiction history. From its design to its interactions with other characters, the robot played an integral role in the show\u2019s success.

In the wake of the failure, officials sought to put a brave face on the mission's outcome and Virgin Orbit's future.\n\n\"We will work tirelessly to understand the nature of the failure, make corrective actions, and return to orbit as soon as we have completed a full investigation and mission assurance process,\" Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit's chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement.\n\nHowever, the confident words belie a reality that the financial road ahead for Virgin Orbit is a very, very difficult one.\n\nA brief history of Virgin Orbit\n\nVirgin Orbit started as an idea in 2011 by Sir Richard Branson as an offshoot of his Virgin Galactic space business, with the goal of fully utilizing the White Knight aircraft. Eventually, it was decided the company, formally created in 2017, would use its own aircraft, a modified Boeing 747-400 named Cosmic Girl, as a platform from which to drop and launch small rockets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLacking revenue of its own, Virgin Orbit was funded for most of a decade by the Virgin Group, the multinational company that owns and operates Branson's various businesses, as well as an Emirati state-owned holding company, Mubadala Investment Company.\n\nIndependent estimates suggest that, over that time, Virgin Orbit spent as much as $1 billion to develop and test its LauncherOne rocket and air-launch system. The company made its first successful launch in January 2021 and has averaged one mission every six months since then.\n\nAn obvious question is this: With such high development costs and a low cadence for a rocket that sells for $12 million per launch, how can Virgin Orbit be financially sustainable?\n\nIn 2021 the company answered its short-term cash needs by going public, merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). However, funds raised from this merger were far less than anticipated. Upon announcing its intent to go public, Virgin Orbit said it anticipated raising $383 million from the proceeds of the SPAC transaction; however, it raised just $68 million from this process and instead had to turn to private investments for an additional $160 million to keep operating.", "title": "Even before Monday\u2019s launch failure, Virgin Orbit\u2019s finances were dismal", "keywords": ["orbit", "small", "launch", "million", "dismal", "finances", "raised", "virgin", "rocket", "spac", "mondays", "orbits", "failure", "company"], "link": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/even-before-mondays-launch-failure-virgin-orbits-finances-were-dismal/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n3/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 3}, "14": {"text": "Japan-made robotic seals known as Paro are being tested to see if they could help relieve astronauts\u2019 stress on a mission to Mars.

There are a lot of questions first-time buyers have when they buy a car cover. Is a car cover worth it, is it usable for everyone, and what is the point of it?\n\nKeeping your car safe is the primary benefit of a car cover. Dust, dirt, and faded paint can be prevented due to UV exposure. It takes a lot of time and effort to apply and remove a high-quality car cover, and it can be very expensive if you opt for a low-quality cover.\n\nThe cover only works if it\u2019s applied correctly. It can lead to scratches and rust when put on the wrong way. This guide will give you everything you need to know about car covers.\n\nWhat is a Car Cover?\n\nThe material that goes over your car is called a car cover. Synthetics, cotton, and plastic are some of the fabrics that can be used to make it.\n\nYou drape the product over your car to keep it safe. It can be used on any car that gets parked outside, even pricier cars like classic cars.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nThe cover is pretty easy to understand. It keeps different environmental factors away from the precious paint on your car.\n\nYou will want to unfold the car cover completely after picking it up. You will be able to see if there are elastics or hold-downs on the sides.\n\nSome covers are similar to fitted sheets, but others are just sewn pieces that are roughly the size of your car.\n\nYou will work your way around the car by putting the cover on the vehicle. The idea is to pull it all the way down so that it covers your vehicle.\n\nIf your car cover wasn\u2019t made for your specific make and model, you might have to fold in your mirrors. You can use any of the included straps, strings, or strings to tighten the cover after it has been covered. You are all finished at that point.\n\nThe cover is supposed to be a protective layer for your car. If a branch falls on your car, it will cause a scratch on your paint. It is a different story even though it is covered.\n\nHigh-quality covers can take a lot of abuse without damaging the car underneath. Since car covers are made from lightweight materials, you should fold up the cover and store it between uses. You can put it in your trunk, or your garage.\n\nWho is the Car Cover Made For?\n\nWhen it comes to car covers, there is a universal need. When I get into some of the benefits, you will understand, but there are a lot of great reasons to have a car cover.\n\nI think anyone who ever parks outside can benefit from a car cover. If you already park in a garage, you can get the same benefits as a car cover.\n\nThey are also great for car lovers. You can cover the cars that get parked outside if you don\u2019t have enough garage space. A car cover is a benefit if you have an old vehicle. If you own a car that isn\u2019t parked in a garage, you should consider a cover.\n\nWhich Car Can Be Covered?\n\nYou will learn quickly that any car can be covered while shopping for car covers. Some options advertise a wide breadth of cars that can be covered with a single product.\n\nFor a certain year, make, and model of vehicle, you can find a cover that is specifically made for that. That means that you can find a cover for almost any car.\n\nThere are aftermarket car covers for Lambos that guarantee a fit.\n\nHow Often Should You Use a Car Cover?\n\nWe recommend that you use your car cover whenever your car isn\u2019t in use \u2013 this also goes for regular vehicles and even collector\u2019s models (including the classics) pieces.\n\nIt might not be the end of the world if you forget to put your cover on, but you never know what could happen.\n\nIt is easy to put on and take off a lightweight cover, which is an excellent tip for everyday-use vehicles.\n\nDust or wash your car for the best protection. This protects the paint from being trapped under the cover. If there is a layer of dirt between the cover and the vehicle, it can cause paint scratches when the cover is moved. It\u2019s important to make sure your car is dry before you cover it.\n\nContour Fit vs Custom Fit Vehicle Covers\n\nCustom-fit car covers are more expensive, but they often perform just as well. For special edition cars, classic collectibles, and high-value muscles, your best bet is to invest in premium custom-designed covers for the perfect fitting.\n\nThe price and availability of features are the most important differences between custom and contour covers. Coverland Car Covers that include mirror and antenna pockets are called custom covers.\n\nThough custom covers provide a tighter fit, they come at a cost and take a longer time to deliver. If you accidentally order the wrong size, you won\u2019t be able to return it with a flexible return policy.\n\nIf you want the same amount of protection for a fraction of the price, you can use a contour fit cover. Your vehicle can get the protection it needs when it needs it, as well as being easily available and shipped within 1-2 business days.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt makes sense to have a cover for your car if you want the highest level of protection. You need to make sure that the one you get is designed to fit the purpose you have in mind. It\u2019s possible to keep your vehicle safe from harm with a little extra work.\n\nIf not sure, you can always reach out to experts for an in-depth analysis according to your region\u2019s climate and your car\u2019s exterior stuff.\n\nShare this: Print\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nSkype\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPocket\n\n", "title": "Here\u2019s All You Need to Know About Keeping Your Cars Safe With Covers", "keywords": ["need", "car", "cars", "know", "custom", "vehicle", "protection", "safe", "keeping", "paint", "lot", "fit", "heres", "cover", "covers"], "link": "https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2023/01/11/heres-all-you-need-to-know-about-keeping-your-cars-safe-with-covers/59024/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n2/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 2}, "16": {"text": "NEW YORK (PIX11) \u2014 Millions of square feet of New York City office space could be converted to residential real estate capable of holding up to 40,000 people under a new proposal from the Adams administration aimed at taking a bite out of the city\u2019s housing crunch.\n\nThe 11-point plan, crafted by the Office Adaptive Reuse Task Force and unveiled Monday, would require changes to both state laws and city zoning requirements. But, if successful, it could add an additional 136 million square feet in vacant and underused office space to a pool of 200 million square feet already eyed for conversion to housing space, according to the administration.\n\nThat could translate to enough space to house 40,000 people, according to Adams.\n\n\u201cThe need for housing is desperate, and the opportunity offered by underused office space is clear \u2014 we know what we need to do,\u201d Adams said, in part, in a statement. \u201cThese concrete reforms would clear red tape and create the incentives to create the housing we need for New Yorkers at all income levels.\u201d\n\nCalls for expanded housing options in New York City have grown increasingly loud, as rising rents and homelessness remain issues.\n\nThe Adams administration\u2019s proposal would give owners of the targeted buildings the option of converting underutilized office space into housing. Buildings identified so far range from Midtown Manhattan to the Bronx\u2019s Hub and Downtown Flushing in Queens.

Kathy Hochul said that she too had taken steps to fix New York\u2019s housing crisis at the state level, including working with Adams.\n\n\u201cGovernor Hochul has been vocal about the need to think strategically and creatively to solve New York\u2019s housing crisis,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cLast year, she signed legislation to facilitate the conversion of underutilized hotel space into affordable housing, and in December, she stood with Mayor Adams to announce the recommendations of the New New York Panel \u2013 which included a proposal to modernize regulations around the conversion of office buildings.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that Hochul would announce plans to fight the statewide housing crisis during her State of the State address, set for Tuesday afternoon.", "title": "Plan would convert NYC office space to housing for 40,000 people", "keywords": ["housing", "need", "space", "40000", "nyc", "office", "city", "convert", "square", "statement", "state", "adams", "plan", "york"], "link": "https://pix11.com/news/local-news/more-nyc-office-conversion-means-housing-we-need-for-40k-adams/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n0/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 0}, "17": {"text": "Activity in the self-driving car industry, frenetic for years, has somewhat stalled in more recent times, but a handful of the most promising companies are continuing to see their businesses grow and attract investment in the process. In one of the more recent developments, Oxbotica, a startup out of England that develops software to power autonomous vehicles, has closed a Series C round of $140 million, money that it will be using to continue building out services for existing clients and to drum up new business in that wake.\n\nThe size of the round is big by any terms, but it\u2019s a signal of how AI startups especially continue to fare well at the moment. It also shows the kinds of companies that are working with, and looking to back, startups breaking new ground in the space of autonomous driving.\n\nThe basic model for Oxbotica \u2014 eight years old and based out of Oxford, England \u2014 is B2B: It sells and customizes its autonomous software, which it dubs \u201cUniversal Autonomy,\u201d for a range of enterprise customers. Its premise is that its flexible technology can power whatever it is that a customer needs: navigation, perception, user interfaces, fleet management or other features needed to run self-driving vehicles in multiple environments, regardless of the hardware being used and in integration with whatever other software its customers are using.\n\nUnderscoring its traction with that premise, this latest funding is coming from a mix of investors that include some of those strategic backers and customers. Japan\u2019s Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance Co., Ltd., and ENEOS Innovation Partners, the corporate VC of the mining conglomerate Eneos, are among its new investors; previous backers in this round include BGF, safety equipment group Halma, hospitality and recreation investor Hostplus, climate fund Kiko Ventures (IP Group), the online shopping company Ocado Group, internet giant Tencent, Venture Science and automotive component maker ZF. Several of these companies also invested in Oxbotica\u2019s last round, a Series B in January 2021 of $47 million.\n\nThis round brings the total raised by Oxbotica to $225 million. The startup is not disclosing its valuation, but Paul Newman, the company\u2019s CTO and co-founder, noted that the fact that it was one of the autonomous startups that\u2019s raising big right now, and the current appetite for artificial intelligence startups that are building applications around their innovations, have contributed to a healthy number.\n\n\u201cYou should take it to be in a space that investors are valuing greatly,\u201d he said. At a moment when businesses, consumers, investors and startups themselves are reassessing things like self-driving technology through a more pragmatic lens, asking questions about unit economics and commercial and technical viability, Oxbotica, he said, has emerged as a leader in \u201cthe application of autonomy where the world needs it.\u201d\n\nThat translated also into much shorter conversations with investors, the kind that are generally not happening across other sectors in tech. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take that much time at all to show you can solve what is really needed versus what is not a problem at all,\u201d CEO Gavin Jackson added. \u201cIt was a distinction investors understood quickly in the first 30 seconds of us talking to them.\u201d\n\nIndeed, while some of the more ambitious efforts around self-driving vehicles for consumers have been shelved or faced some tragic mishaps, it\u2019s emerged that campus-style, closed environments where it\u2019s either more dangerous and/or less efficient to employ humans to navigate vehicles have shaped up to be some of the most popular use cases for it and others building autonomous systems.\n\nIn addition to the industries of its strategic investors, other use cases where Oxbotica is building services include agriculture, airports, energy and shared passenger transportation.\n\nNot to say that things are perfect. Some (and perhaps all) of its actual commercial deployments appear to be quite medium- to long-term. One of its big milestones from this year was in May 2022, when it ran Europe\u2019s first zero-occupancy trial (note the word trial) on a publicly accessible road. It also worked on \u201cmetaverse-based testing\u201d and forged alliances with insurance companies.\n\nNewman admits what he described in our interview as \u201csticking points\u201d that still need addressing in the very complex world of building autonomous vehicles and systems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating when we can connect fleet management to our operating system,\u201d he told me. In its favor, once something is solved, it\u2019s solved for everyone. A mining company\u2019s need to integrate Oxbotica with its system to dispatch drivers into mines is the same that Ocado will have for connecting its delivery vehicles.\n\nThe amount that it has proven, meanwhile, has convinced customers and backers that it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cif\u201d anymore, but rather when this comes to fruition.\n\n\u201cOxbotica really sets itself apart from its competitors thanks to its ambitious vision to unlock Universal Autonomy,\u201d said Mitsuru Yamaguchi, senior managing executive officer at Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance, in a statement. \u201cWe are excited to combine Oxbotica\u2019s world-class AI and robotic techniques with our own pioneering expertise in the telematics insurance arena. This will leave us well placed to develop innovative insurance products and services which will create a safer, greener and more secure society for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited to grow our investment in Oxbotica, which has become a global leader in autonomous vehicle software,\u201d added Erin Hallock, managing partner at bp ventures. \u201cOur sustained support is a great example of bp ventures\u2019 continued investment in game-changing technology companies. By leveraging automation and digital technology we believe the team can improve safety and increase efficiency across a wide range of vehicles, and support bp\u2019s ambition to accelerate the global revolution in mobility.\u201d", "title": "Oxbotica raises $140M more as its B2B autonomous vehicle platform gains ground", "keywords": ["oxbotica", "raises", "140m", "building", "technology", "gains", "vehicles", "autonomous", "software", "round", "investors", "insurance", "b2b", "startups", "ground", "vehicle", "platform"], "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/10/oxbotica-raises-140m-more-as-its-b2b-autonomous-vehicle-platform-gains-ground/", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n0/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 0}, "18": {"text": "PAGE NOT FOUND\n\nThe release you are looking for might have been removed or it is temporarily unavailable.\n\n\n\nPlease try the following:\n\n\u2022 If you typed the page address in the Address bar, make sure that it is spelled correctly.\n\n\u2022 Go to the www.webwire.com home page and look for links to the information you want.\n\n\u2022 Click the Back button to try another link.\n\n\u2022 Search for the information your looking for using form below.", "title": "Page Not Found (Error 404)", "keywords": ["page", "404", "error", "using", "information", "typed", "unavailableplease", "temporarily", "wwwwebwirecom", "try", "address", "looking"], "link": "https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp%3FaId%3D299089", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n0/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 0}, "19": {"text": "NASA is still willing to fund unusual concepts in its bid to advance space exploration. The agency is handing out $175,000 initial study grants to 14 projects that could be useful for missions in and beyond the Solar System. The highlight may be TitanAir, a seaplane from Planet Enterprises' Quinn Morley that could both fly through the nitrogen-and-methane atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and sail its oceans. The \"flying boat\" would collect methane and complex organic material for study by sucking it in through a porous leading edge.\n\nA project from UCLA's Artur Davoyan, meanwhile, could speed up missions to the outer edge of the Solar System and even interstellar space. His design (shown at middle) would propel spacecraft by producing a \"pellet-beam\" of microscopic particles travelling at very high speed (over 74 miles per second) using laser blasts. The concept could dramatically shorten the time it takes to explore deep space. Where Voyager 1 took 35 years to reach interstellar space (the heliopause, roughly 123AU from the Sun), a one-ton spacecraft could reach 100AU in just three years. It could travel 500AU in 15 years.\n\nArtur Davoyan\n\nOther efforts are sometimes similarly ambitious. MIT's Mary Knapp has proposed a deep space observatory that would use a swarm of thousands of tiny satellites to detect low-frequency radio emissions from the early universe, not to mention the magnetic fields of Earth-like exoplanets. Congrui Jin from the University of Nebraska in Lincoln has envisioned self-growing habitat building blocks that could save space on missions to Mars, while Lunar Resources' Peter Curreri has devised pipelines that could shuttle oxygen between Moon bases.\n\nThese are all very early initiatives that aren't guaranteed to lead to real-world tests, let alone missions. However, they illustrate NASA's thinking. The administration is funding the projects now in hopes that at least one will eventually pay off.
