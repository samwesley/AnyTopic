• NASA has created a humanoid robot named Apollo that is intended to help with tasks like laundry at home and explore space.
• Apollo includes sensors, cameras, and computer-vision algorithms along with two hands and arms with 7 degrees of freedom in each hand. 
• The robot will be able to detect objects in its environment using computer vision algorithms allowing it to grasp an object without assistance from humans. 
• The robot is being developed as part of the PhantomX program which seeks to develop robots for public use both on Earth and in space exploration missions. 
Daily Briefing:
• NASA has developed the humanoid robot 'Apollo' which can perform tasks like doing laundry at home and outer space exploration.
• It consists of sensors, cameras, 2 hands & arms each having seven degrees of freedom & computer vision algorithms are leveraged for autonomously detecting objects so that it can reach out & grasp them.  
• This project is part of PhantomX program focused on building robots for everyday use on Earth & outer space explorations missions respectively. Article: 1 block 1:  Not Applicable Article: 2 block 1:

- Fincantieri and the Italian Hydrographic Institute of the Navy have reached an agreement for the building of a new research vessel
- The hull will be built in Castellammare di Stabia within 24 months 
- After completion, it will become part of the Ammiraglio Magnaghi active fleet
- This is one of three vessels partially funded by EU funds to strengthen oceanographic research activities led by IHN 
- The design has been optimized with advanced technologies to reduce acoustic emission, fuel consumption and impact on sea environment.
