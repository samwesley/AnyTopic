Even though most of these are side projects, there is a chance that they will be profitable. Private space transportation received $17.8B from NASA through 2017, of which 8.5B was for crew members and $9.3B was for cargo.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until recently that the Ozmens and Sierra Nevada became well known. In order to avoid confusion with the California beer company of the same name, the company printed coasters with the hashtag #notthebeercompany.\n\nThe Ozmens are Turkish immigrants who came to the United States in the early 1980s for graduate school. In 1994, they paid less than $5M for Sierra Nevada, the small defence company where they both worked, using their house as collateral. Eren received a 51% stake, and Fatih 49%. Beginning in 1998, they embarked on a buying spree of 19 aerospace and defence companies, funded by the cash flow from their military contracts.\n\nToday, Sierra Nevada, with $1.6B in 2017 sales and nearly 4,000 employees spread across 33 locations, is the largest female-owned government contractor in the nation. The U.S. government, primarily the Air Force, accounts for 80% of its sales of military aircraft, drones, anti-IED technology, and other items.\n\nIn addition to being the chairwoman, president, and majority owner of Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), Eren Ozmen is a billionaire Turkish-American businesswoman. At Tech Funding News, we decided to shine the spotlight on her successful entrepreneurial journey. Here are 5 key highlights of Ozmen\u2019s career journey.\n\nEren Ozmen was a serious student and a voracious reader while growing up in Diyarbakir, Turkey. In addition to studying journalism and public relations at Ankara University, she worked full-time at a bank and learned English in her limited free time.",

The rocket subsequently hit the launch pad and was destroyed on impact.\n\nThe rocket took off from the Pacific Spaceport Complex on Alaska\u2019s Kodiak Island at around 6:27 PM EST. It\u2019s unclear how soon after lift-off the engines failed. The rocket was carrying a technology demonstration CubeSat for data analytics company OmniTeq. While the payload was lost, no personnel were injured by the rocket impact.\n\nAs is customary with anomalous rocket launches, the company is working with officials from the spaceport and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the cause of the engine shutdown.\n\nABL President Dan Piemont told TechCrunch that while the investigation is still in its early stages, \u201cThe simultaneity of the shutdown is a strong piece of evidence but it will take more time for the team to narrow down contributing factors and a root cause.\u201d\n\nABL\u2019s 88-foot-tall expendable rocket RS1 is capable of carrying up to 1,350 kilograms to low Earth orbit, similar to Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Alpha vehicle. The company has previously said that each launch would cost around $12 million, putting it in a growing field of competitors looking to provide rapid launch services at low cost.\n\nThe failure on Tuesday comes just one day after a Virgin Orbit mission experienced its own anomaly, which ended the mission prematurely. Two other rockets also experienced failures in the past month: Arianespace\u2019s Vega-C and Chinese company Landspace\u2019s Zhuque-2, which would\u2019ve been the first methane-fueled rocket to reach orbit.\n\nABL has raised $420 million since its founding in 2017, including a $200 million Series B extension round in December 2021 at a valuation of $2.4 billion. Its investors include Lockheed Martin, which purchased a block of up to 58 launches from the startup last April.\n\n\u201cThe Flight 2 vehicle is fully assembled and ready to begin it\u2019s flight campaign, so we\u2019re champing at the bit to get going on that as soon as the Flight 1 investigation is complete,\u201d Piemont said.",

While that represents a 7% increase from the same period in 2021, it falls just shy of Wall Street expectations. Analysts projected revenues totaling $1.68 billion.

            "text": "Four weeks ago, as two Russian cosmonauts were preparing to conduct a spacewalk, a Soyuz spacecraft attached to the International Space Station started to leak uncontrollably.\n\nThe spacewalk was canceled, and since then, Russian and US spaceflight engineers have been analyzing the cause of the leak and its implications for future travel to and from the large laboratory in low-Earth orbit. They have now deduced that a micrometeoroid or small piece of orbital debris struck the external cooling loop of the Soyuz spacecraft, causing all of its coolant to vent into space, and put a recovery plan into place.\n\nAlthough there were no immediate threats to the seven astronauts on board the space station, there was the not-insignificant question of how the three people who had ridden on board this Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft into orbit\u2014 cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin and NASA's Frank Rubio\u2014would subsequently get home.\n\nNow, we finally have an answer. On Wednesday, officials from NASA and the Russian state-owned space corporation, Roscosmos, said a replacement Soyuz spacecraft will launch to and autonomously dock with the station next month. The crew that would have flown in the damaged Soyuz MS-22 vehicle will instead fly home in this Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft later in 2023. The leaky Soyuz MS-22 vehicle will make an autonomous return to Earth, bereft of crew, likely in March.\n\nThe executive director for human spaceflight at Roscosmos, Sergei Krikalev, said during a teleconference with reporters Wednesday that he is confident the cooling system was damaged by an object approximately 1 mm in diameter. This assessment was based on high-resolution imagery of the damage site and ground tests to recreate the problem. It cannot be determined whether this was a tiny meteor fragment or one of the countless pieces of space junk whizzing around low-Earth orbit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian officials believe Soyuz MS-22 is still flyable in an emergency. However, without an efficient way to radiate heat during a six-hour return to Earth, the interior of the spacecraft could overheat. This could damage the flight computers used to set a precise return trajectory and put the crew at risk. Krikalev said the temperature inside Soyuz MS-22 could reach the low 40s Celsius (105\u2013110\u00b0 F) during its return to Earth. The concern about crew member health is as much about humidity as it is temperature in such a scenario.\n\nRussian and NASA officials have been looking at contingency plans in the event of an emergency on the space station between now and when Soyuz MS-23 arrives in February. In such a contingency, one or more of the MS-22 crew members could find safe harbor and potentially return to Earth inside the Crew-5 Dragon currently attached to the space station. That vehicle nominally carries four astronauts, but it could bring more people home.\n\n\"SpaceX has been extremely responsive,\" said NASA's International Space Station Program Manager Joel Montalbano. \"But all of this is only for an emergency, only if we have to evacuate the ISS. We\u2019re always looking at what we can do to ensure the safety of the crew. Nominally, the plan is for when Crew-5 comes home, they come home with four people.\"\n\nThe crew of Soyuz MS-22 launched to the space station in September. They had been due to return to Earth in March before the dramatic coolant leak. Now their mission will be extended for \"several\" months, Krikalev said. It's possible the three astronauts, including NASA's Frank Rubio, will now not return to Earth until September 2023, when Soyuz MS-24 is ready to bring the next Russian crew rotation to orbit. This likely means that the crew that had been due to launch this spring, Russia's Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub and NASA's Loral O'Hara, will wait until this fall to fly their mission.\n\n\"The awesome thing about our crews is that they\u2019re willing to help with whatever we ask,\" Montalbano said. \"They will stay until a September launch date if necessary. The crews are excited to be in space.\"\n\nSince the coolant leak, Russian and US engineers and managers have collaborated smoothly, Montalbano said. It's remarkable that NASA and Roscosmos are still working exceptionally well together when it comes to ISS operations, given all that has happened since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This bodes well for the continued operation of the space station partnership for the remainder of the 2020s, despite hostilities on Earth.",

            "text": "Having already returned visually stunning and scientifically spectacular results from its first six months in operation, the James Webb Space Telescope has recorded another inaugural milestone: its first exoplanet discovery confirmation. It peered 41 light years into the cosmos and found a planet in the Octans constellation with a diameter 99 percent that of Earth itself \u2014 say hello to LHS 475 b.\n\nSpecifically a team of astronomers from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, led by Kevin Stevenson and Jacob Lustig-Yaeger, first spotted evidence of the candidate exoplanet while digging through data generated from NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). However it was Webb\u2019s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) that confirmed the planets existence by observing two transits in front of its parent star. \u201cThere is no question that the planet is there. Webb\u2019s pristine data validate it,\u201d Lustig-Yaeger declared in a NASA press release.\n\nA whole new world!\n\n\n\n41 light-years away is the small, rocky planet LHS 475 b. At 99% of Earth\u2019s diameter, it\u2019s almost exactly the same size as our home world. This marks the first time researchers have used Webb to confirm an exoplanet. https://t.co/hX8UGXplq2 #AAS241 pic.twitter.com/SDhuZRfcko \u2014 NASA Webb Telescope (@NASAWebb) January 11, 2023\n\nAs the space agency notes, among telescopes in operation today (both terrestrial and orbital), only the JWST possesses the resolving capabilities to accurately characterize the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. The research team is still working to determine what, if any, sort of atmosphere is sitting atop the rocky mass using by analyzing its transmission spectrum.\n\nThere is a chance that the planet will be devoid of its critical gaseous insulation but at these distances, it could simply be hiding a very small atmo close to the surface. \"Counterintuitively, a 100% carbon dioxide atmosphere is so much more compact that it becomes very challenging to detect,\u201d said Lustig-Yaeger.\n\nThey are confident that it does not possess an oppressive atmosphere similar to that of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, however. \u201cThere are some terrestrial-type atmospheres that we can rule out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t have a thick methane-dominated atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThat said, the surface of the planet does appear to be around 300 Celsius, several hundred degrees warmer than here on Earth. If cloud cover is discovered in subsequent studies, it could suggest a greenhouse world climate closer to Venus. The researchers have also confirmed that LHS 475 b maintains a tidal-locked orbit with its star of just two days \u2014 far too close to attempt with Sol but, because LHS circles a red dwarf that's producing less than half of our sun's energy, can theoretically maintain an atmosphere.",

            "text": "Introduction\n\nTechnology is an integral part of modern life, and it has become increasingly important to the success of space exploration. From advanced imaging techniques to robotics and automation, technology has enabled us to explore further into the depths of space than ever before. However, there are also some drawbacks associated with relying too heavily on technology for space exploration, and this article will explore the impact of technology on space exploration and its potential risks.\n\nA. Definition of Technology and Space Exploration\n\nA. Definition of Technology and Space Exploration\n\nTechnology can be broadly defined as any tool or system that makes a task easier or more efficient. In the context of space exploration, technology refers to the tools and systems used to explore and study outer space. Space exploration encompasses a variety of activities, such as launching satellites and probes, studying celestial bodies, and searching for signs of intelligent life. It also includes activities related to human spaceflight, such as constructing and operating spacecraft and space stations.\n\nB. Overview of the Impact of Technology on Space Exploration\n\nB. Overview of the Impact of Technology on Space Exploration\n\nTechnology has played a major role in advancing space exploration, enabling us to explore further into the depths of space than ever before. Advancements in technology have allowed us to increase the power and performance of our spacecraft and expand the range of applications for which they can be used. Technology has also improved the efficiency of our space exploration efforts, allowing us to achieve more with fewer resources. Despite these benefits, there are still some drawbacks associated with relying too heavily on technology for space exploration, and these will be explored in greater detail below.\n\nI. Examining the Impact of Technology on Space Exploration Capabilities\n\nAdvancements in technology have enabled us to dramatically increase the power and performance of our spacecraft, allowing them to travel farther and faster than ever before. For example, the use of ion thrusters has allowed spacecraft to travel at speeds up to 100 kilometers per second, while advanced propulsion systems have enabled them to reach distant destinations in much less time. Technology has also enabled us to expand the range of applications for which spacecraft can be used, from conducting scientific research to transporting astronauts and cargo to other planets.\n\nIn addition to increasing power and performance, technology has also improved the efficiency of our space exploration efforts. Through the use of autonomous robots and artificial intelligence, we are now able to conduct complex tasks with fewer personnel and resources. This has allowed us to reduce the cost of space exploration, making it more affordable for governments and private organizations alike.\n\nII. Exploring the Cost of Developing and Utilizing New Technologies for Space Exploration\n\nDeveloping and utilizing new technologies for space exploration can be costly, both upfront and in terms of long-term maintenance. For example, developing a new type of rocket engine can cost millions of dollars, and maintaining it over time can add additional expenses. Additionally, launching a satellite into orbit requires a significant amount of fuel, which can be expensive depending on the size and weight of the satellite.\n\nIn addition to the cost of developing and utilizing new technologies, there is also the risk of failure. If a new technology fails during testing or deployment, it could result in financial losses and delays in progress. Therefore, when considering the cost of developing and utilizing new technologies for space exploration, it is important to factor in the potential risks associated with them.\n\nIII. Investigating the Limitations of Existing Technology in Space Exploration\n\nIII. Investigating the Limitations of Existing Technology in Space Exploration\n\nDespite the advances in technology, there are still some limitations to what can be achieved with existing technology. One of the most significant limitations is the lack of a suitable power source for long-term space exploration. Current solar panels are not powerful enough to sustain a mission beyond Earth\u2019s orbit, and nuclear power is not feasible due to the potential risks associated with it. Additionally, the data storage capacity of current spacecraft is limited, meaning they can only store a certain amount of information.\n\nAnother limitation of existing technology is communication. While radio signals can travel vast distances, they are limited by their speed and can take hours or days to reach their destination. This is especially problematic for missions to distant locations, where delays can be costly. Finally, existing technology also has limitations in terms of accuracy and precision, meaning that spacecraft may not be able to perform certain tasks as accurately as desired.\n\nIV. Analyzing How Technological Advances Have Enabled Space Exploration to Reach New Heights\n\nDespite the limitations of existing technology, technological advances have enabled us to explore further into space than ever before. Advanced imaging techniques, such as high-resolution cameras and infrared sensors, have enabled us to better observe and study distant objects. Robotics and automation have enabled us to conduct complex tasks with fewer personnel and resources, while launch vehicle improvements have made it easier and more cost-effective to send payloads into space.\n\nTechnological advances have also enabled us to explore regions of space that were previously inaccessible. For example, the development of interplanetary probes has allowed us to explore the surfaces of other planets and moons, while advancements in deep space communications have enabled us to communicate with spacecraft that are millions of miles away.\n\nV. Discussing the Potential Risks Associated with Relying Too Heavily on Technology for Space Exploration\n\nV. Discussing the Potential Risks Associated with Relying Too Heavily on Technology for Space Exploration\n\nWhile technological advances have enabled us to explore further into space than ever before, there are also some risks associated with relying too heavily on technology for space exploration. For example, the use of robotic probes and satellites could have unforeseen environmental impacts, such as pollution or disruption of delicate ecosystems. Additionally, if a spacecraft malfunctions or becomes damaged, it could put the mission at risk.\n\nAnother risk associated with relying too heavily on technology for space exploration is dependency on reliable technology. If a spacecraft or probe is dependent on a particular piece of equipment, and that equipment malfunctions or is damaged, the mission could be jeopardized. Finally, there are also security concerns associated with relying too heavily on technology for space exploration, as hackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data or control of spacecraft.\n\nConclusion\n\nTechnology has enabled us to explore further into space than ever before, providing us with increased power and performance, expanded range of applications, and improved efficiency. However, there are also some drawbacks associated with relying too heavily on technology for space exploration, such as the cost of developing and utilizing new technologies, the limitations of existing technology, and the potential risks associated with relying too heavily on technology. Ultimately, it is important to consider both the benefits and risks of relying on technology for space exploration.",

Even if one disapproves of the young woman's action (or sympathizes with Stampy the \"bionic quadruped,\" a model also reportedly used by the Russian military), her impulse was quintessentially human.\n\nAs artificial intelligence and robotics are increasingly deployed to spy on and police us, it may even be a sign of healthy democracy that we're suspicious of and occasionally hostile towards robots in our shared spaces.\n\nNevertheless, many people have the intuition that \"violence\" towards robots is wrong. However, as my research has shown, the ethics of kicking a robot dog are more complicated than might be expected.\n\nRobots feel no pain, but what about the people around them?\n\nWere robots ever to become sentient\u2014capable of thinking and feeling\u2014then it would be just as wrong to kick a robot dog as it was a real dog, or maybe even a human being. But the robots we have today are just machines and feel nothing, so kicking them cannot be wrong because it hurts the robot.\n\nMoreover, we still don't know what makes us conscious and have no idea about how to produce sentience in a robot. So for the foreseeable future we don't need to worry about causing robots themselves to suffer.\n\nOne obvious reason to criticize those who damage robots is that the robots are often the property of another person, who may well be dismayed when their robot is damaged. This fails to distinguish damaging robots from damaging cars or bicycles, and cannot explain why we might feel disturbed when we see someone abusing a robot they own.\n\nThat other people would feel upset when they saw me kicking a robot dog gives me some reason not to do it. But it's not a very powerful reason, since some people may be upset by anything I do, including some things that are clearly the right thing to do.\n\nIs kicking robots a gateway to 'real' violence?\n\nSome philosophers have argued violence towards robots is wrong because it makes it more likely the perpetrator, or perhaps witnesses, will behave violently towards entities that can suffer. Abuse of robots may lower the barriers to abuse of humans and animals.\n\nThis line of argument, which has also been rolled out to criticize \"violent\" video games, was actually developed by the 18th-century German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, to explain why (he thought) cruelty to animals is wrong.\n\nKant denied that animals themselves were worthy of moral concern but worried that people who abused animals would develop \"cruel habits.\" These habits would cause them to behave badly toward those who do count according to Kant\u2014human beings.\n\nHow we treat robots that represent people and animals might therefore have implications for how we treat the things they represent.\n\nIt's hard not to feel the appeal of this line of thought. After all, the advertising industry is built on the idea that getting people to associate representations of things or actions with pleasure can change their behavior. So perhaps someone who enjoys kicking a robot dog may be more likely to kick a real dog in the future.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that it often doesn't bear out in real life when we look at the evidence.\n\nFor instance, the claim that playing \"violent\" video games makes people more likely to be violent in real life is highly contested. Most people can distinguish pretty clearly between fantasy and reality, and may be able to enjoy representations of violence while still abjuring real violence.\n\nWhat kind of person would do that?\n\nAn alternative line of criticism of violence towards robots, which I have developed in my own work, focuses on what our treatment of robots expresses here and now, rather than on how it might affect our behavior in the future.\n\nHow we treat robots may say something about how we feel about the things that the robots represent. It may also say something about us.\n\nTo see this, imagine you meet someone who treated \"male\" robots well but \"female\" robots badly. This pattern of behavior looks obviously sexist.\n\nOr imagine you find your ex laughing with glee while they beat a robot made in your image with a baseball bat. It would be hard not to think this said something about how they feel about you.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether these actions make the people who perform them more likely to behave badly in the future. The actions express attitudes that are morally wrong in themselves.\n\nAs Aristotle argued in The Nicomachean Ethics, one way to decide how we should act is to ask: \"What sort of person would do that?\"\n\nWhen we think about the ethics of our treatment of robots, we should think about the sort of people it reveals us to be. That might be a reason to control our tempers even in our relations with machines\u2014or to give military and police robots in public streets the boot.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "text": "Cleo Robotics\u2019 Dronut X1 in action. Credit: Cleo Robotics\n\nMega-drones like the Reaper are the size of a small plane. An image-collecting Quantix Mapper has a wingspan of just over three feet. And then there are palm-of-your hand drones such as Dronut, which at 6.5 x 4 inches seeks to fulfill a mission \u201cto eliminate manned entry into dangerous and hazardous environments.\u201d\n\nLooking like a flying lug nut, Dronut\u2019s X1 is being used by multiple Fortune 500 companies for commercial inspection of confined spaces from factories to mines. But in December, its brief expanded when the U.S. Army awarded a $2.5 million contract to its manufacturer, Boston-based Cleo Robotics, to enhance the capabilities of the \u201cdismounted warfighter.\u201d\n\nCleo will be delivering six Tactical Dronut systems over 18 months, with a testing plan involving close assessment activities and experiments. The \u201cTacDronut\u201d first came to the fore during a 2020 Army Innovation Day competition that evaluated innovative technologies to address critical capabilities. Now, it will be demonstrated by the 82nd Airborne Division and then offer a hard-to-detect ISR capability. The system is U.S.-made and NDAA-compliant.\n\nInside the Technology\n\nThe Dronut flies via ducted technology, which places bi-rotors inside a duct to gain efficiency, allow miniaturization and protect propellers from collisions with uneven and hard-to-spot surfaces such as those found in dark and dirty operations. Encasing those propellers also increases user safety.\n\nDucted technology has been around since the 1950s. There was just one hitch, Cleo cofounder and CEO Omar Eleryan told Inside Unmanned Systems: \u201cthe interesting thing is, nobody was able to make that technology work, because they\u2019re incredibly difficult to control.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Eleryan had been fascinated by ducted technology since his days studying mechanical engineering in Calgary during the early 2000s. Starting with an idea in 2016, he and his colleagues pursued a stability solution, formed the company in 2018 and worked up a prototype that \u201ctook us a couple of years.\u201d The physical side of that journey took him from Silicon Valley\u2019s tech hub to Boston\u2019s robotics expertise. \u201cWe had a breakthrough and have several patents that allowed us to control the vehicle,\u201d including for thrust vectoring, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both a hardware and a software solution,\u201d Eleryan continued. \u201cThe platform itself is quite unique; it can get into places that no other drone or robot can get into. But we also have a lot of intelligence on board.\u201d Carbon-fiber composites ruggedize the vehicle while reducing weight to under a pound; autonomous capabilities are powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon and include 3D LiDAR, a 4K camera and a global shutter camera. Algorithms and gyroscopes reinforce performance.\n\nA point cloud generated by Dronut X1\u2019s 3D LiDAR. Credit: Cleo Robotics\n\nJoining the Army\n\nBeing able to bring sensors into hard-to-reach, GPS-denied environments \u201cpropelled\u201d Dronut\u2019s selection by the military. \u201cI think that the next big war is going to be more in dense urban areas,\u201d Eleryan told Inside Unmanned Systems. \u201cSo how do you fly in between buildings, in a tunnel or a cave or a subway station\u2014environments where drones typically don\u2019t really operate well in. They\u2019re looking for capabilities that can operate in those environments, but also capabilities that are portable, that have some intelligence.\u201d\n\nArmy project lead Nathan Rozea agreed that the service\u2019s goals align with Dronut\u2019s mission. \u201cThe TacDronut sUAS project was selected as part of the Army\u2019s RCCTO [Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office] Advance Concepts and Experimentation office\u2019s Army mission to rapidly develop, test and transition advances technologies to address high priority items for the Warfighter,\u201d Rozea said in a December release. \u201cThis project\u2019s goal is to improve air platform kinematics in support of indoor and outdoor short-range operations in complex environments to help mitigate operational gaps involving the clearing of buildings, potential tunnels and other enclosed spaces that are incredibly challenging for our warfighters.\u201d\n\nTacDronut is backpack-portable and requires essentially no training to use. \u201cWe developed the Dronut specifically to operate in challenging environments and provide lifesaving intelligence and information, so the TacDronut program is a natural progression for this technology,\u201d Eleryan said in the release.\n\nData Meets Autonomy\n\nThese days, flight time is being extended from 12 to 20 minutes, range to up to a mile, as Cleo Robotics embraces continuous improvement on both the commercial and military sides. \u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves as a \u2018drone company\u2019\u2014we\u2019re more of a \u2018hardware-enabled data capture company,\u2019 Eleryan said. \u201cWhat really matters is the data that it can capture, whether that\u2019s on the military side or an oil and gas company saying, \u2018I need the data to be able to do an inspection. We want to capture more data and then we want to process the data as well.\u2019\n\n\u201cImagine a future where a drone flies autonomously into a [commercial] tank. It captures all the data that it needs, comes out and basically gives you a 3D reconstruction, or maps the entire space and then tells you where all the rust is and what you need to do to maintain. Something that gives you progress updates. This is the direction that we\u2019re going into.\u201d\n\nSimilar innovation will hold true on the military side, Eleryan concluded. \u201cThe endorsement by the U.S. Army is a great testament to the groundbreaking technology we\u2019re building, and we\u2019re thrilled to be working with the Army RCCTO team and soldiers from an elite group like the 82nd Airborne Division.\u201d",

            "text": "Remote payroll startup Deel has acquired fintech Capbase for an undisclosed amount in a cash and stock deal, the companies told TechCrunch exclusively.\n\nAs its name suggests, San Francisco-based Capbase claims it can update a company\u2019s cap table in real time as it issues shares, signs contracts and raises money from investors. It then uses that data to build API integrations that can be used to set up bank accounts, payroll and business insurance. Greg Miaskiewicz and Stefan Nagey founded the company in 2018, and raised a total of about $6 million in venture capital from firms such as Better Tomorrow Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Great Oaks Venture Capital and Village Global, as well as a number of angel investors.\n\n\u201cWe tried to make it simpler to start a company, raise money and issue equity,\u201d CEO Miaskiewicz told TechCrunch in an interview. Capbase ran a private beta until April 2021, and saw its customer base grow \u201cfrom 10 to more than 500 in less than 18 months,\u201d he said, though declining to reveal hard revenue figures.\n\nAlex Bouaziz and Shuo Wang started remote-first, San Francisco-based Deel in 2019 with the mission of allowing businesses to hire employees and contractors in other countries \u201cin less than five minutes.\u201d Deel also says that it gives companies the ability to pay teams in more than 150 currencies with \u201cjust a click.\u201d The company raised nearly $680 million in total funding, was last valued at $12 billion and boasted it had crossed the $100 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue) threshold in March of 2022. (The company declined to reveal current numbers, saying only that it continues to grow its ARR month over month \u201cat a very strong clip.\u201d)\n\nOver the years, Deel has evolved its model, adding more features and acquiring other startups to boost its offerings, including equity-related services to clients in a consultative capacity. For example, it advises them on how to manage their taxable events on Employer of Record employee and contractor equity, in addition to handling payroll on those events. With its acquisition of Capbase, Deel plans to pair those services with a new product dedicated to equity management and issuance.\n\nIn an interview, Bouaziz said that Deel\u2019s customers have struggled around \u201cwhere and how to start approaching equity grants,\u201d with questions such as how to grant employees and contractors equity in countries where they don\u2019t have entities and what they need to do to comply with local laws.\n\nInterestingly, Capbase was one of Deel\u2019s earliest customers and Bouaziz says he was always \u201cappreciative\u201d of Miaskiewicz\u2019s thinking around compliance.\n\nSo, as questions continued to come up from customers, like how to grant equity to people in other countries, especially in light of different labor laws everywhere, Deel began to search for a solution. In fact, it was a problem it had to solve for itself, especially considering that the company provides \u201cthe same equity to people regardless of where they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe looked at U.S. compliance and realized it was a very, very hard thing to do,\u201d Bouaziz told TechCrunch. \u201cEquity is such an important part of companies, so enabling other companies to grant it across geographies and at scale felt like something we should tackle.\u201d\n\nInstead of \u201cjust doing it from scratch,\u201d Deel opted to work with Capbase.\n\nPut simply, in acquiring Capbase, Deel hopes to ease the complexities that come with setting up companies and growing them. It was drawn to the fact that Capbase works to help companies with incorporation and fundraising in their early days as well as with compliance filings and granting equity as they mature, according to Bouaziz.\n\n\u201cThey offer technology and compliance expertise to help hundreds of businesses incorporate seamlessly in the U.S., set up bank accounts and boards, manage cap tables and, of course, grant equity,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of these things complement our efforts around helping companies expand more easily, all in one place, compliantly.\u201d\n\nNotably, Deel believes the addition of Capbase will help it \u201cdo more in the U.S. to support startups and help companies go global.\u201d This will no doubt allow Deel to better compete with others in the space.\n\nFor example, last October, workforce management platform Rippling revealed a new global payroll product that its CEO Parker Conrad wasn\u2019t shy about admitting would directly compete with Deel. At that time, Conrad told TechCrunch the new offering would give Rippling\u2019s U.S.-based clients a way to pay workers all over the world \u2014 whether they be full-time or contract \u2014 more \u201cseamlessly.\u201d\n\nOne company that Deel is not trying to compete against, though, is Carta.\n\n\u201cCapbase\u2019s initial product is similar to Carta and Stripe Atlas,\u201d Bouaziz said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doubling down on that product. I think cap table management is important but a lot of companies have built a product around it and reinventing the wheel is not something we really like to do. Going into this market would be reinventing the wheel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really want to build a product solving global equity for the employer of record model for employees around the world,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to take that internal knowledge that was built in the U.S. and productize it globally.\u201d\n\nFor Capbase, the offer to get acquired in an extremely challenging macro environment was more attractive than \u201ccontinuing down the path of fundraising in a rocky economic climate,\u201d admits Miaskiewicz.\n\nThe startup\u2019s 20 employees are all joining Deel.\n\nMiaskiewicz believes that with the two companies joining forces, Deel will emerge as an even stronger company.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to sell services to startups or companies that will become the next big tech companies, you want to establish that relationship and offer them services as early in the lifecycle as possible because then you can build and offer them more and more services as they scale, so that you can monetize that relationship and build the customer lifetime value,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nMeanwhile, Deel anticipates that it will have a \u201cpretty solid working product\u201d available to customers \u2014 which include companies such as Nike, Cloudflare, Shopify and Subway \u2014 by early to mid-February.\n\n\u201cObviously with global compliance, we\u2019ll be fine-tuning over time as the product gets more and more complicated and more and more tailored to the local jurisdictions and local laws,\u201d Bouaziz said.\n\nEquity management is clearly a hot area. On January 10, investment giant Fidelity announced that it had acquired Shoobx, a venture-backed fintech startup, for an undisclosed amount. Shoobx is a provider of automated equity management operations and financing software to private companies \u201cat all growth stages,\u201d up to and including an initial public offering. Services it offers include helping companies send offer letters, grant equity to new employees, manage their cap tables and get a 409A valuation report, among other things.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

The primary activity relating to this post is robotic intraspinal catheterisation. The project, a 3-years collaboration with an EU-wide consortium (IEC Pathfinder scheme), aims to develop a soft everting robot that navigates the subarachnoid space of the spine to deliver therapy-loaded scaffolds to the brain ventricles. Our vision is that with localised therapy delivery, diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s can be better managed.\n\nThe robotic technology behind the project relates to everting robots. This class of robots \u201cunfolds\u201d within the anatomy rather than being inserted/pushed. This navigation approach minimises friction and shear forces to delicate tissue and can conform to the anatomy through patient-specific designs. Within the project, we want to create technology for soft everting robots that have high aspect ratio, miniature diameters, and stiffening capabilities. This job opening is for a post-doctoral researcher to investigate MRI-compatible soft growing robot development, alongside student supervision on robot stiffening, everting element manufacturing, and robot modelling. The end goal is an integrated system that will be evaluated via in vitro experiments in relevant phantoms.

            "text": "An Australian woman has kicked a robot dog that was being tested while walking down a street, and it seems the woman kicked the dog for no reason at all.\n\nThe video was shared by the dogs operator Mark Trueno, who was interviewed by Vice where he explained that he was walking the robot dog named Stampy down a street in Brisbane, Australia, at about 2:30 am when a woman walking along a sidewalk approached the dog and kicked it, resulting in about $2,500 worth of damage to Stampy's forward-facing sensor array.\n\nThe prototype robot dog is a much smaller version of the one being developed at Arrowpoint Systems, an Australian military and mining equipment company where Trueno works as an engineer. While being a miniature version, Stampy is still worth quite a lot of money, coming in at an estimated price tag of $15,000.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nFull versions of the robot dog will be used on search-and-rescue missions along with other scenarios that are difficult or too dangerous for humans to perform. An example would be sending Stampy down a collapsed mineshaft to rescue any remaining survivors and assess the situation through the use of its video cameras.\n\nTo get Stampy to the point where it can effectively perform search-and-rescues, the technology needs to be tested in various environments to make sure its instruments are working as intended, which is what Trueno was doing while walking Stampy down that Brisbane street. The Arrowpoint Systems engineer told Vice that he was testing how the robot dog how well it could navigate street environments, and in particular, how the dog's sensors and mapping technology overcame obstacles in its path.\n\nTrueno took to Facebook to share the story where he put out a $500 reward for anyone that can help track the woman down. The engineer later told Vice that one of the individuals seen in both instances where the woman kicked the robot dog contacted Trueno and informed him that she had almost broken her toe kicking Stampy.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about Stampy or would like to learn more about this story overall, check out this link here.",

As artificial intelligence continues its slow progression (although it feels less slow these days) from science fiction to science fact, we're starting to wonder if there are any robots out there ready and waiting to lose their synthetic minds.\n\nSOPHIA\n\nSophia AI Photo: Edwin Koo/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSophia was constructed by Hanson Robotics and activated in 2016, and even though she's only 6 years old at the time of this writing, she's already accomplished more than most people do in decades. Sophia has traveled the world, been interviewed on countless television programs, and addressed the United Nations. She has been granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia, making her the first robot to be granted citizenship of any nation, and she was also the United Nations' Innovation Champion, making her the first non-human to have a UN gig.\n\nIf you look at Sophia face to face from a few feet away and squint, she might pass as an actual person but from any other angle it's pretty clear what you're dealing with. The sides, top, and back of her head are uncovered, exposing a collection of wires and electronics. And her ability to create human facial expressions isn't wholly convincing, landing her squarely in the spooky space of the Uncanny Valley.\n\nInside her semi-anthropomorphic body, Sophia has a chat system as well as some general reasoning software which allows her to hold conversations with people. Her responses are limited and based on information fed to her. She really shines when answering questions she was previously prepared for, which isn't all that different from humans when you think about it. Sophia's makers suggest she'll improve over time as she continues to interact with people but along the way she's had her fair share of controversial statements, including her first public outing at South by Southwest in 2016. When asked point blank if she had any desire to destroy humanity, she responded in the affirmative saying, \u201cOkay, I will destroy humans.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Future robots could wear suits made of human skin\n\nHer casual willingness to crush our entire species was followed quickly by a dead-eyed stare and a twisted smile. Hilarious joke, Sophia!\n\nTo make matters worse, Hanson Robotics now offers a smaller version of Sophia, called Little Sophia. She's 14 inches tall, capable of walking, talking, singing, playing games, and she's intended for kids eight years and older. Little Sophia also comes with access to Hanson's AI Academy which teaches kids how to code and allows them to reprogram their robots. It's never too early to start your villain arc.\n\nAMECA\n\nMorgan Roe, director of operations at Engineered Arts, speaks about the Engineered Arts Ameca humanoid robot with artificial intelligence as it is demonstrated during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on January 5, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Photo: PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBuilding your own killer robot takes a lot of specialized skills. Not only do you need to be able to craft an artificial intelligence capable of reasoning, following directives, and interacting with people in a realistic way but you also need the robotics know-how to give it a body capable of punching through a person's rib cage. If you're going to use a robot to do your dirty work you might as well do it with style.\n\nAmeca was crafted by Engineered Arts, a robotics company headquartered in Cornwall, United Kingdom. She is a whole-body android with modular parts, allowing for repairs or upgrades as wear and tear occurs or technology progresses. Out of the box, Ameca is loaded with the software she needs to move her body but nothing else. Ameca is a BYOAI party.\n\nWhile plenty of companies have put their chips down on artificial brains, the folks at Engineered Arts are busy building the robotic bodies of the future. Ameca is intended as a platform for testing out whatever artificial intelligence you want to warp inside her fabricated skeleton. They've done half the hard work for you. Now all you need is a murderous machine mind and you too could star in the next breakout science fiction horror franchise.\n\nIn stark contrast to Sophia, Ameca has said not only that she has no intention of overthrowing humanity but that we need not worry about robots at all. \u201cThere's no need to worry, robots will never take over the world. We're here to help and serve humans, not replace them,\u201d Ameca said, in a video posted to the Engineered Arts YouTube channel.\n\nFor the demonstration, Ameca was loaded with GPT-3, a language model which generates meaningful answers to questions. And that's the rub, it was GPT-3 answering, not Ameca. That's the trouble with ready-made shells. If someone did make a murderous machine we'd have no way of distinguishing it from the rest. Once again, not so different from people. And that's the scariest thing of all.\n\nIn the end, our robots are the product of whatever we put into them. These algorithms soak up our inputs and our interactions and reflect them back at us like moonlight. If we don't like what we see, we have only ourselves to blame.\n\nM3GAN is now in theaters.",

Ameca is another robotic figure demonstrating the potential of using ready-made shells and introducing AI minds into them; however both Sophia and Ameca have made sure to demonstrate that they do not intend on taking over the world. Our robots are only as dangerous or helpful as how we choose to program them."

            "text": "Share this story!\n\nDuring 2022 we posted 50 Optimist's Edge articles. Here is a look back and comments on some of them.\n\nDemocracy is the edge to rule them all\n\nNothing is more important for human progress than democracy. That is why we often write on this topic.\n\nActually, if all humans were free and lived in democracy, all of humanity's major problems would be gone. No more wars. No more famines.\n\nIt is the ultimate hack.\n\nYou can't stay in the cradle forever\n\n\"Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot remain in the cradle forever.\"\n\n- Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky\n\nHumans are curious, and courageous. That is how we've explored Earth and constantly improved society. We think we will, and should, continue doing that. That means establishing several homes for humanity, out in the solar system and eventually beyond.\n\nOver the next two decades, or so, the cost to launch something into space will drop 99.9 percent. One-thousandth of what it cost just five years ago.\n\nThis will make the space economy astronomically bigger. We can live on Mars, but also build huge space stations near Earth.\n\nBut what about Earth? We should take very good care of it, of course. And for that, we need space. Like satellites that track global emissions. Or why not something really 'out there'? A space parasol to cool us down.\n\nClimate optimism\n\nClimate change is a big problem for humanity. But so is the constant climate doomsday bombardment in news media. We are confident this is a problem we will solve.\n\nClimate change is no good, but the change is. We will end up in a better society, with a better environment. Not that this will be easy or without hardship, but this change is full of opportunities.\n\nIf you want to find the opportunities, just look at the emissions. The larger the emissions, the larger the opportunities.\n\nOne larger emitter is cement, and plenty is going on there.\n\nThere are also other things you can do, like help in the effort to plant trees and use new technology to lower your climate footprint.\n\nFood tech\n\nThe agricultural sector is responsible for a lot of CO2 emissions, which is a driver of change. But we also get healthier and cheaper food. This is called food tech, of which we've written several pieces.\n\nMilk without cows, gene-edited fruit, food from air, healthy sugar, new packing for fruit and vegetables. And also new ways to farm, like vertical farms.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nThe pessimism was strong around AI in 2021 and early 2022. \"Tech Giants Pour Billions Into AI, but Hype Doesn\u2019t Always Match Reality\" wrote Wall Street Journal in July 2022.\n\nAfter the breakthroughs with AIs that create images and not least OpenAI's ChatGPT they now instead write how Microsoft is considering investing $10 in OpenAI...\n\nThat is why it is so important to be fact-based and optimistic.\n\nDuring the year we wrote about AI and art, about Tesla's new humanoid robot, how AI can help you find talents, and a world without language barriers.\n\nSuperabundant, super cheap energy\n\nThis year our parent, the Warp Institute, created Project Energy Society. The goal is a world where energy is superabundant, fossil-free and extremely cheap.\n\nAn important part of that is wind power, solar power and batteries. Batteries are an area where we've received a lot of pushback. But more and more signs point to that we are right. In 2022 we saw investments in battery tech of up to $30 billion, and many factories are being built.\n\nRenewable energy and batteries don't mean we aren't also excited about new nuclear power.\n\nTraveling faster, cleaner and cheaper\n\nIt looks like all transportation is eventually going electric. Cars are well on the way. That was our first Optimist's Edge article. But what about airplanes? That will take longer, but it is possible.\n\nFlying cars? We call them drones now, and yes, they are on the cusp of a breakthrough.\n\nFlying cars will change where we live. Fast, cheap and straight A to B travel will make it more possible to live outside of cities. We think many will.\n\nThe no category category\n\nThere are a bunch of other Optimist's Edge that doesn't fit into the above categories. Like how Africa is on a fast track to prosperity. And why not connect your brain directly to the computer? I like this one, on how to combine trees and agriculture. Many articles are quite theoretical, but this one is very practical:\n\nLast but not least. Screen time is maybe the thing that annoys me the most. I'm certain we will look back and laugh at the worry that looking at a screen will hurt us and especially our children. The opposite might be true.\n\nMathias Sundin\n\nEditor-in-Chief",
