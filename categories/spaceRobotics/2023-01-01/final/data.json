The weapon could deliver a nuclear warhead from the Soviet Union to cities on the U.S. east coast in under 30 minutes. In order to avoid this threat, a researcher at Boeing called Jerry Pournelle devised a solution through an impressive invention. He came up with a space weapon that could hit any area on earth in 15 minutes (half the time of ICBMs) and could even intercept an ICBM midway to its destination. It could also shoot down targets buried 30 meters in the ground which is where the Soviet Union kept its nukes. The entire nature of the weapon was not revealed. It was also unclear how this weapon was used. YouTuber Veritasium answers all these questions and even tests out a smaller version of the weapon for good measure.

A robotic arm called Flippy dunks the French fries in sizzling oil at a Jack in the Box location and runs the tortilla chip station at a Southern California Chipotle store. The minds behind these robots\u2014Miso Robotics, a startup with a host of Caltech connections\u2014design and test them right in the heart of Pasadena. When co-founder and chief research officer Ryan Sinnet (BS \u201907) helped start Miso in 2016 along with partners including vice president of hardware engineering Rob Anderson (BS \u201916), the founders chose Pasadena to be close to the robotics research at Caltech, which has its locus at the Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST). Today, the firm routinely hires new employees and interns from the Institute because of its robotics focus. \u201cWhat does it take to build a start-up in a new space or even just a competitive business? I think it takes the best people and the right people that have to have a certain skill set,\u201d Sinnet says. \u201cAnd Silicon Valley being kind of saturated, a lot of people are interested in these opportunities here.\u201d Over the past couple of decades, the start-up ecosystem in Southern California has blossomed and developed an ecosystem with the funding, institutional collaboration, and people to support start-ups in fields from robotics to biotechnology, says Andy Wilson, executive director for the Alliance for SoCal Innovation. While Silicon Valley is known for innovations in software and computing, Wilson says, and \u201cSilicon Beach\u201d on Los Angeles\u2019s west side focuses on digital content and film, the east side\u2019s ecosystem centered around Pasadena has become a hub for start-ups in what he calls \u201cfrontier technologies\u201d like solar energy, telescopes, batteries, and artificial intelligence. The innovation community is buoyed by the students and ideas that emerge from not only Caltech but also universities around the region plus an acceleration in venture capital and spaces for new start-ups to work. Meanwhile, the Institute has grown its partnerships with private industry. The AWS Center for Quantum Computing, the result of a partnership between Caltech and Amazon Web Services, recently opened on the north side of campus. Meanwhile, says Fred Farina, Caltech\u2019s chief innovation and corporate partnerships officer, the Institute is working to build new space for start-ups on Green Street that will stand alongside a new home for the Carnegie Institute for Science. \u201cThese are events that would\u2019ve been unthinkable a decade ago in the area. And it\u2019s because we\u2019ve got people that have put down roots and have developed their skill sets and their company technologies.\u201d These partnerships benefit both Caltech and its home city, says David Tirrell, Caltech provost and Ross McCollum-William H. Corcoran Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. \u201cThey enrich the intellectual atmosphere in the Caltech community and create good jobs in the city of Pasadena.\u201d Farina says these results come from the Institute taking a much more proactive approach over the past half decade toward supporting and stimulating the Pasadena innovation ecosystem. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure that we have the tools and the infrastructure around campus to keep start-ups around Pasadena and to try to attract larger companies to Pasadena,\u201d he says. When Steve Mayo (PhD \u201987), now the Bren Professor of Biology and Chemistry and Merkin Institute Professor, joined the Caltech faculty in 1992, he already had experience in translating his laboratory research into a commercial company. As a student in the 1980s, he created Molecular Systems Inc. (now Biovia, which creates software products to aid researchers in molecular modeling, data science, and other fields). So, when one of his first graduate students, Bassil Dahiyat (PhD \u201997), wanted to create a start-up based on his work in protein engineering, Mayo became both an academic and entrepreneurial mentor. With Mayo\u2019s help, Dahiyat launched the life sciences company Xencor and became its president and CEO. \u201cIt was very daunting,\u201d Dahiyat says. \u201cWhat Steve did is just to say, \u2018It\u2019s possible.\u2019\u201d A quarter-century later, Xencor is one of the anchors of the Pasadena innovation ecosystem, developing therapeutic antibody and cytokine treatments for cancers and autoimmune disorders. The advantages of living in Southern California have always helped Dahiyat attract people with life sciences expertise to the area. And now that Xencor is one of several established biotech firms in town, the positive effects of being part of an innovation community have begun to snowball. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got multiple biotech companies spinning out of places like City of Hope, Caltech, or UCLA that want to be in the Pasadena area\u2014successful growth companies getting big [initial] financing and companies getting bought by big pharmaceutical companies,\u201d he says. \u201cI think these are events that would\u2019ve been unthinkable a decade ago in the area. And it\u2019s because we\u2019ve got people that have put down roots and have developed their skill sets and their company technologies. They\u2019re not just bailing out and flying up to San Francisco, which is what most of them had done.\u201d Michael Amori (MS \u201907) shares a similar story. After completing his master\u2019s degree, the sunshine and quality of life kept him in town. \u201cHonestly, I just loved Caltech, and I also just loved the climate in Pasadena,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it was a great place to raise a family.\u201d His closeness to campus also provided the spark for Virtualitics, an AI-driven data visualization start-up he co-founded that is now headquartered next to campus on Lake Avenue and which was born from a very Caltech idea. Through alumni events, Amori was introduced to George Djorgovski, professor of astronomy and data science and director of the Center for Data Driven Discoveries (CD3), and to research done in collaboration with Ciro Donalek, a computational staff scientist at CD3. Donalek uses his PhD research in artificial intelligence to help Caltech astronomers analyze big data sets, such as when they search for one object of interest amid a sea of dark-sky images. He and Djorgovski also helped to create virtual spaces in which collaborators dispersed around the world could work together, such as the first professional community of astronomers in Second Life, the online platform that allowed users to create virtual versions of themselves and a \u201cvirtual Caltech\u201d built in VR, where students could hang out. \u201cThey then started using the virtual environments more for data analytics\u2014to see objects in 3-D and really explore the data and the models with other people in real time.\u201d The different parts of Donalek\u2019s research came together when Amori approached him about starting a company called Virtualitics, which uses three-dimensional visualizations to help clients understand data analysis at a level that goes beyond looking at numbers on a page. For instance, the firm can use data analysis to predict which mechanical parts of an aircraft or tank are in danger of failing the soonest. But sometimes its defense contractor clients need more information than a list of potentially problematic parts. \u201cThe problem with that is that the user does not feel a lot of confidence in the recommendation, because the user does not understand why that is being recommended,\u201d Amori says. \u201cIf the user then has to explain to his or her boss why he\u2019s doing some very time-consuming maintenance on a part that hasn\u2019t broken down yet, the boss may not be so supportive.\u201d The company\u2019s data visualization helps the AI show its work, so to speak, by not only showing the troublesome part in 3-D but also explaining its rationale for suggesting the part may be about to fail. Like Miso Robotics, Virtualitics sees a variety of benefits from its proximity to Caltech. \u201cI think the most important connections are to the talent that we can hire,\u201d Amori says. \u201cA lot of our employees, a lot of our engineers, are Caltech graduates, and being able to get access to these really smart, hardworking students is good. Then the other thing, on our board of advisors we have a couple of professors from Caltech who help us out on some of the technical problems that we need to solve, and that\u2019s also been extremely valuable. I think it\u2019s really the talent pool that you have here.\u201d Still, any innovation community has its growing pains. When Virtualitics started in 2016, Amori and his colleagues had to put in extra work to find venture capital to back the company\u2014whereas in places like Northern California, some of the world\u2019s biggest tech investors are right across the street. When Xencor started in the late 1990s, Pasadena had relatively little by way of wet lab spaces that biotechnology firms require, Dahiyat says. But now, Wilson says, Southern California is coming into its own by bringing those resources to bear. In 2015, Wilson, in partnership with Mike Giardello (a Caltech postdoc and longtime CEO and CTO of Pasadena-based Materia), worked with the city and Caltech partners including Farina and the Caltech Office of Technology Transfer and Corporate Partnerships (OTTCP) to launch Innovate Pasadena, an organization dedicated to strengthening the local innovation ecosystem and spreading the word about what\u2019s happening in this community. Before then, only a few venture capital firms operated in Pasadena, he says. Now, when the organization hosts networking events, 20-plus VCs\u2014such as Kairos, Thin Line Capital, Wavemaker 360, Calibrate, Pasadena Angels, Smash Capital, Freeflo, and Mandala Space Ventures\u2014show up. Caltech itself is now working with Wilson Hill Ventures, an independently managed firm whose mission is to advance Caltech-affiliated startups. Pasadena also is now home to the headquarters of Alexandria, one of the nation\u2019s biggest real estate firms specializing in creating wet lab space for bioscience companies. The company is collaborating with Caltech on a large new research and development center to be built just north of campus on Green Street. Protomer, which is now owned by Eli Lilly and Company and grew out of Caltech research into therapeutic proteins, has established a Pasadena presence too. The city of Pasadena is just the beginning. Southern California is a sprawling region with an enormous, diverse population, elite universities, and dreamers who want to solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges. The next challenge is to fully unify SoCal into a start-up powerhouse. \u201cWe have all the ingredients, but it is challenging to make the cake because we\u2019re all so spread out and so diversified,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cOur work at the Alliance is really to knit the fabric that\u2019s the innovation ecosystem across Southern California.\u201d Get all the latest Pasadena news, more than 10 fresh stories daily, 7 days a week at 7 a.m. Your email address will not be published.

Their neuromorphic sensors coupled with advanced AI techniques create unique data and insights for SDA and EO applications. The system is low power and produces only relevant data which enables their proprietary algorithms to rapidly produce unique insights from the ground or in space. Astrosite solutions enable the design of an agile global sensor network that can be redeployed in 24 hours. The system provides synchronized microsecond resolution across a network and creates digital fingerprints of resident space objects, these advanced characterization.\n\n\n\n\nClutch Space Systems Limited (Guildford, United Kingdom) is leading the revolution for the next generation of spacecraft operations on low earth orbit, with persistent connectivity, and real-time situational awareness for tangible improvements in mission efficiency and utility. They are providing global coverage through their network of micro-ground stations, each with a simultaneous capacity of twenty satellites, for telemetry, tracking and control, and for real-time spacecraft situational awareness position and attitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEO Robotics (Sydney, Australia) has a mission to image anything within the Solar System on demand. They provide resolved images and analytics of space objects to governments and commercial satellite operators that provide critical insights, such as object identification, satellite damage assessment and more. They do this through using their flyby inspection technique, where they use Earth Observation (EO) satellites during their downtime to image other space objects as they fly past. They have 33 satellites that they have access to today and are building toward 2,500 cameras to provide ubiquitous and on-demand coverage of all Earth orbits.\n\n\n\n\nKatalyst Space Technologies (Flagstaff, Arizona) develops modular spacecraft designs and mission architectures that interact with on-orbit robotics to increase responsiveness, and mission flexibility. Katalyst\u2019s mission is to advance innovations with in-space servicing and assembly while solving existing problems like space congestion and space traffic management. Katalyst\u2019s retrofittable SDA module is designed to non-invasively attach to spacecraft without prepared interfaces to provide local awareness. The project is planned to launch a demonstration mission in May 2024. Katalyst also develops automated software for use with existing SDA infrastructure like ground and space-based sensors to characterize resident space objects for space, size, and attitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLumi Space (Yateley, United Kingdom) is enabling sustainable space activity for future generations with precise space surveillance data. They are deploying a global network of ground-based systems for satellite tracking, including Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR). By measuring the position of satellites in orbit precisely, they can predict their paths more accurately than existing methods. In doing this, they are critical to minimizing uncertainty in collision warnings and enabling exciting new space applications. They see data uncertainty as the biggest risk to global space activity, and a significant limiting factor for many novel space companies (active debris removal, in-space manufacturing, rendezvous, and proximity operations to name a few).\n\n\n\n\nMeta Mission Data (Lincoln, United Kingdom; Washington, DC) looks beyond sensors, terminals, and platforms to put data first in C4ISR mission effects. They combine deep operational ISR experience with mission-focused engineering across Tactical Data Links, complex Data Analytics, and Information Assurance to create adaptive solutions for multi-domain customers. Their unique Low Earth Orbit Airborne Space Surveillance Operations (LASSO) software optimizes traditional lookdown EO/IR camera systems for the detection, tracking, imaging, and classification of Resident Space Objects. LASSO delivers an innovative solution for Space Domain Awareness that can be rapidly re-tasked and networked into a game-changing global system for the Space sector.\n\n\n\n\nSilentium Defence (Adelaide, Australia) is a global leader in the design and deployment of passive radar systems for tactical and strategic surveillance scenarios. A disruptive technology, designed and developed in Australia, their unique situational awareness solutions enable customers to detect without compromise and act with confidence across sea, air, land, and space domains. Their MAVERICK S-series sensors provide the ability to persistently track objects across a wide arc of space, providing accurate, independent data for space traffic management. In an increasingly congested domain, MAVERICK S-series provides globally unique, cost-effective space surveillance data. Silentium Defence is on a mission to change the way the world does surveillance and help keep people, places, and critical assets safe.\n\n\n\nAbout Catalyst AcceleratorThe Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate and United States Space Force\u2019s Catalyst Accelerator is a NewSpace-focused defense and national security industry accelerator, headquartered on the Catalyst Campus for Technology and Innovation (CCTI, a Colorado 501(c)3) in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Share this story! The need for important battery minerals is growing but many of them exist on stones on the ocean floor. Now, a company called Impossible Metals have come up with a method which makes it possible to mine the ocean in a sustainable way - a hovering robot.  Our sea floors are covered in \u201cpolymetallic nodules\u201d which basically are stones filled with different metals in them. Impossible Metals have recently shown that it\u2019s possible to harvest these stones without dredging with large destructive plows but rather use precision and smart learning. The method is the world's first undersea selective mining robot called the Eureka 1.  These nodules are full of lithium, nickel as well as cobalt and according to Good News Network, they could provide battery manufacturing with a more sustainable supply that doesn\u2019t involve carbon-intensive mining, and avoids the geopolitical difficulties associated with pursuing these minerals in conflict zones or unstable states. \u201cOur harvesting machines don\u2019t touch the seafloor,\u201d said Renee Grogan, Chief Sustainability Officer and Co-founder GNN. \u201cWhat we\u2019re designing is a fleet of underwater robotic vehicles. And they are not tethered to the vessel. They don\u2019t make contact with the seabed. They hover above it.\u201d Once the robot hovers above the seafloor, an AI-powered computer picks up the nodules using a host of horseshoe crab-like grabber arms situated on the underside and feeds them through a hose into a collection chamber. The Eureka 1 dove to a depth of 25 feet and successfully noticed the difference between nodules and ordinary rocks in November this year (2022). The robot also utilized a special \u201cbuoyancy compensation engine\u201d to bring the precious stones to the surface.  \u201cThis shallow water milestone demonstrates progression of our principles of avoiding serious harm to the seabed by replacing dredging technology with an alternative that prevents biodiversity loss and large sediment plumes\u201d said Oliver Gunasekara, CEO & Co-Founder to GNN.

The authors peg the likely date of the event to either 977 or 957 BCE. The next-earliest description of a candidate aurora is found on Assyrian cuneiform tablets dated between 679-655 BCE, three centuries later. As we've reported previously, the spectacular kaleidoscopic effects of the so-called northern lights (or southern lights if they are in the Southern Hemisphere) are the result of charged particles from the Sun being dumped into the Earth's magnetosphere, where they collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules\u2014an interaction that excites those molecules and makes them glow. Auroras typically present as shimmering ribbons in the sky, with green, purple, blue, and yellow hues. There are different kinds of auroral displays, such as \"diffuse\" auroras (a faint glow near the horizon), rarer \"picket fence\" and \"dune\" displays, and \"discrete aurora arcs\"\u2014the most intense variety, which appear in the sky as shimmering, undulating curtains of light. Discrete aurora arcs can be so bright, it's possible to read a newspaper by their light. That was the case in August and September 1859, when there was a major geomagnetic storm\u2014aka, the Carrington Event, the largest ever recorded\u2014that produced dazzling auroras visible throughout the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia. The Bamboo Annals is a chronicle of ancient China, written on bamboo strips, that begins with the age of the Yellow Emperor and runs through the so-called Warring States period (5th century\u2013221 BCE), when rival states were engaged in intense competition. It ended when the state of Qin unified the states. The original text of the Bamboo Annals was buried with King Xiang of Wei, who died in 296 BCE, and wasn't discovered until 281 CE, thus surviving Emperor Qin Shi Huang's burning of the books in 212 BCE (not to mention burying hundreds of Confucian scholars alive). The original text consisted of 13 scrolls that were lost during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 CE). There are two versions of the Bamboo Annals still in existence. One is known as the \"current text,\" consisting of two scrolls printed in the late 16th century. Many scholars believe this text is a forgery, given the many discrepancies between its text and portions of the original quoted in older books, although some scholars have argued that some parts might be faithful to the original text. The other version is known as the \"ancient text,\" and was pieced together by studying the aforementioned quoted portions found in older books, especially two dating back to the early 8th century CE. Independent researcher Marinus Anthony van der Sluijs and Hisashi Hayakawa of Nagoya University relied on the ancient text for their new analysis. This text describes the appearance of a \"five-colored light\" visible in the northern part of the night sky toward the end of the reign of King Zhao of the Zhou dynasty. Auroras tend to only be visible in polar regions because the particles follow the Earth's magnetic field lines, which fan out from the vicinity of the poles. But powerful geomagnetic storms can cause the auroral ovals to expand into lower latitudes, often accompanied by multicolored lights. Per the authors, during the 10th century BCE, Earth's north magnetic pole was about 15 degrees closer to central China than today, so the people there may well have witnessed such displays. While this is technically an unconfirmed candidate aurora, \"The explicit mention of nighttime observation rules out daytime manifestations of atmospheric optics, which sometimes mimic candidate events,\" the authors wrote. Furthermore, \"The occurrence of a multicolored phenomenon in the northern sky during the nighttime is consistent with visual auroral displays in mid-latitude regions.\" According to van der Sluijs and Hayakawa, the 16th century current text's translation of the passage in question described the event as a \"comet,\" rather than a \"five-colored light,\" which is why the candidate aurora has not been identified until now.

The title of \u201chottest thing in the market\u201d usually changes hands a lot. In the race to sit at the top of the industry, competition is expected to be fierce. Bitcoin (BTC) is sitting comfortably at the top and other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) are trying to get as close as they can. Rocketize (JATO) seems to be on a hot streak and dominant cryptocurrencies like this do not show up often. Rocketize (JATO) has been dominating other meme coins and now it wants to target the major players in the crypto industry. Rocketize (JATO) might be a new player in the crypto market but it isn\u2019t one to be overlooked. This BEP-20 token is no joke and thanks to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), users can enjoy very fast transactions with very low transaction fees. Rocketize also has the \u201cAtomic Nation\u201d, its community which it is building to become the largest one in the crypto industry. The Atomic Nation is the backbone of Rocketize (JATO) and with their help, Rocketize (JATO) might become unstoppable. Members of the Atomic Nation will also receive rewards because half of all taxes collected on fees will be shared among Rocketize (JATO) holders. This way, users can earn more passive income as the community grows and Rocketize (JATO) becomes more widely used. The other half of the fees will be burned and as more gets burned, it can help increase the prices of the Rocketize (JATO) token and earn users even more money. Bitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency to be launched in what everyone now knows as the crypto industry. Users have Bitcoin to thank for all the advantages of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and because it is the oldest, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained unrivaled on the top of the crypto market. The identity of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) creator is still unknown and he goes by the alias, \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d. He gave the world the perfect payment system. Being decentralized, Bitcoin (BTC) transactions do not require a third party, and users can perform very quick peer-to-peer transactions with very low fees. The creation of Bitcoin (BTC) also gave people an easy, cheap, and very fast way to perform international transactions. Bitcoin (BTC) gave a lot to its users and it still has a lot more to offer to anyone interested in hopping on the Bitcoin train.  Solana (SOL) became a member of the crypto industry in 2020 and was able to garner a lot of attention thanks to its stellar blockchain. The highly efficient and open-source Solana blockchain was built to help increase smart contract adoption. To achieve this, Solana employs a combination of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-History (PoH) consensuses. With this, it can handle up to 50,000 transactions every second. Solana (SOL) is also a direct rival to Ethereum (ETH) and it is one of the Ethereum Killers. Its blockchain supports smart contracts, building Decentralized Applications (dApps), and it has also started taking Non-Fungible Token (NFT) lovers away from Ethereum. Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana\u2019s creator, has built something special and the rate at which Solana (SOL) is growing proves that. Rocketize (JATO) is more dominant than a lot of analysts expect and now it has new targets: Solana (SOL), and the king, Bitcoin (BTC). If Rocketize (JATO) can keep going like this, it could soon become the cryptocurrency others are trying to overthrow.

Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana\u2019s creator, has built something special and the rate at which Solana (SOL) is growing proves that.\nFinal Thoughts\nRocketize (JATO) is more dominant than a lot of analysts expect and now it has new targets: Solana (SOL), and the king, Bitcoin (BTC). If Rocketize (JATO) can keep going like this, it could soon become the cryptocurrency others are trying to overthrow.\nFor more information on Rocketize (JATO), please visit the following links:\nPresale: https://rocketize.io/buy \nWebsite: http://rocketize.io \nTelegram: https://t.me/RocketizeTokenOfficial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is solely the author\u2019s opinion and not investment advice \u2013 it is provided for educational purposes only.

It can also be utilized to survey and monitor nuclear and chemical contamination levels. The ROV has stair-climbing capabilities and can operate continuously for 3 hours. The ROV can be controlled either by fiber optic communication over a 100m distance or can be controlled by wireless communication over a 500m line of sight. This mini UAV has been developed for surveillance applications. It is battery-operated, silent, and equipped with a Day Camera with zoom for detailed surveillance. It also has an optional Thermal Imager for night operations. IT Several UAV systems have been supplied to Paramilitary Forces and Police and are currently in operation. DAKSH MINI is a battery-operated tracked vehicle with multiple degrees of freedom manipulator arm (telescopic arm) weighing not more than 100 kg. DAKSH MINI is capable of extracting suspected objects with a telescopic manipulator arm. The DAKSH-SCOUT is remotely controlled from a portable Operator Console using RF. It has an adequate number of cameras suitably mounted on the platform for real-time viewing in front, at the rear, and on either side. Ballbot is a very small differential-drive robot for short-range visual recon. The Ballbot is an ideal solution for surveillance, reconnaissance, and patrolling. It has a modular chassis, sensor, and computer which can be reconfigured as per the specific requirements. The Ballbot is targeted for CI/CT (counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism) operations and for paramilitary forces. It provides remote eyes on the ground and reduces human casualties. Each MUGV can carry two Ballbots and the operator can deploy them remotely and subsequently all three can be controlled independently. A new version of Ballbot is in the making and it boasts of features like multi-robot collaboration and integration with flying platforms. Sentry medium-sized robot for threat localization. The Robot Sentry is a steerable four-wheel drive robot intended for urban outdoor operations. The robot is meant to autonomously explore and map a campus with real-time feedback to the remote station on a Wifi Network. Salient Features include features like Omnidirectional movement capability with a max speed of 7mph, a max slope 15 degree. Perception suite consisting of 3D-LIDAR, monocular and stereo cameras with on-board computer. The UXO handling Robot (UXOR) is capable to handle, diffuse and detect Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) i.e. Bombs and Missiles up to 1000 kg remotely from of 1km LOS. UXOR is based on an IC Engine operated, tracked Skid Steer Loader platform, with good cross-country mobility with six hours of endurance. UXOR is capable to diffuse Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) i.e. Bombs and Missiles with low-order detonation. UXOR is having multiple DOF manipulator arms with a cutting mechanism to defuse the UXO. Sewak can be a safe alternative for hospital staff like medical professionals and health workers taking care of COVID-19 patients in quarantine centres and hospitals. Sewak can be teleoperated by the hospital staff from a remote location to navigate the robot in the quarantine zone and distribute food, water, medicine, etc. to the affected persons. The operational distance is about 30-50m (can be extended). The robot gets power from maintenance-free rechargeable batteries and can work continuously for 5 hours on a full charge. It has a capacity of 30 kg. A video camera fitted in the front helps navigate to the patient\u2019s bed. The audio facility provided by the robot facilitates two-way communication between the patient and the hospital staff. This will help the hospital staff communicate with the patient to understand his/her health condition and the recovery he/she is making, explain the dosage of the medicines, and comfort the patient.  DRDO has developed six and four-legged robots. These robots have three degrees of freedom legs giving them Omni-directional motion capability. The robots have been equipped with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance. The hexapod, a six-legged robot, has reptilian leg configuration while the quadruped, four-legged robots, has a mammalian leg configuration. The quadruped has additionally been provided with actuated wheels to enable hybrid locomotion capability. These platforms have given insight into the implementation of stable gaits for legged locomotion. This robot demonstrates concepts of whole-body locomotion. The snake robot has 14 active joints. Lateral undulation, side winding, and rolling gaits have been implemented on this robot. A color camera mounted in the hood of this robot provides video feedback. Snake e Robot for use in search and rescue during earthquakes and inspections in constricted areas such as pipes, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations.

Media | IT Magazine\n The machine uses computer vision to \u2018see\u2019 the world. Artificial intelligence (AI) models are created to mimic how live things can perceive, interpret, and understand their environment. Machines accomplish this by analysing the photos, videos, and surrounding objects. Computer vision was heavily utilised in recent innovations like Tesla\u2019s Optimus Robot and Full-Self Driving for object identification and image tracking. For picture processing and interpretation, computer vision is used in even 2D to 3D models. 8,161 submissions were received for the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2022, and thousands of them attempted to address various AI/ML issues. Let\u2019s examine some of the foreseeable trends in the field of computer vision in light of these breakthroughs and improvements. Autonomous Vehicles The goal of developing self-driving cars has been ongoing for a while. Identification of the things around the car is one of the most crucial steps in creating autonomous vehicles so that it can travel and navigate safely. Algorithms based on computer vision can be used in this situation. Auto-labelling is one of the strategies that businesses like Tesla have adopted to advance their self-driving cars. Other transportation-related applications like vehicle classification, traffic flow analysis, vehicle identification, monitoring of road conditions, accident avoidance systems, and driver attentiveness detection can benefit from the same technology. Increased use of edge computing There will probably be a trend toward adopting edge computing to perform computations closer to the source of the data as the demand for real-time processing of visual data grows. Computer vision tasks have historically been carried out on centralised servers or cloud-based platforms, which can be laborious and call for a steady internet connection. With the use of edge computing, these systems can make rapid judgements based on visual data without repeatedly transmitting it to the cloud for processing. Robotics Robots can navigate and manipulate objects in their environment by using algorithms to analyse images and video from cameras. This allows robots to detect and identify objects as well as understand their shape, size, and location. This is one of the main areas where computer vision is expected to play a significant role in robotics. As a result, robots may be able to carry out operations like gripping and moving objects as well as dodging pitfalls and navigating through challenging environments. Robots can comprehend human behaviour by analysing facial expressions, body language, and other visual cues using computer vision. Robots might therefore be employed in fields like customer service, teaching, and healthcare. Retail Cameras can be deployed in shops and retail establishments to inspect products on shelves, automatically determine the stock, and identify the most popular items. Similar to how filters on Snapchat or Instagram work by superimposing items on top of the person in front of the camera, augmented reality (AR) can be used to create \u201cvirtual fitting rooms\u201d or \u201cvirtual mirrors\u201d so that users can test out items without touching them or even visiting the story. 3D reconstruction We first saw text-to-image models in 2022, and those eventually gave way to text-to-3D models. This further led to the development of 3D reconstruction models utilising techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which could convert 2D photos into 3D meshes that could be used for building models in the metaverse and for recreating scenes. As a result, people can engage with digital worlds in a more authentic and natural way. This can also be utilised to create immersive virtual and augmented reality experiences. SpaceTech If you point your phone at an item in the sky, Apple\u2019s computer vision-based apps can find it. This is only one example of how computer vision is used in the space business. We can precisely map and analyse the Earth\u2019s surface and environment by analysing imagery and data gathered by satellite or aerial sensors. Additionally, we can foresee future catastrophes like earthquakes and hurricanes and then work efficiently to lessen their effects by analysing geographical data obtained from satellites. By locating and identifying space objects and also detecting their many features, computer vision can be employed for space exploration. The identification of these objects can also be used for space cleanup efforts, which NASA, ISRO, and all other major technology corporations are contemplating.", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                 Artificial Intelligence\n                             \n\n \n                                 Mixed Reality (MR)\n                             \n\n \n                                 News\n                             \n \nHere\u2019s a look at the Computer Vision trends that are likely to dominate the industry next year\n\n\n\n \n                    21 hours ago                    \n\n\n\n                    Shashvat Prakash                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe machine uses computer vision to \u2018see\u2019 the world.

The Commissioner/Secretary, Public Works Department, Ajeet Kumar Sahu, along with the officials of PWD, Ladakh held an interactive session with the Director and professors from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. The team from IIT headed by Prof. Parmeshwar Iyer; the Director, IIT Guwahati, gave a comprehensive presentation on the achievement made by the institute in the area of newly emerging 3D technology, viz 3D metal machine parts printing and constructing civil structures They demonstrated various kinds of machine parts and special requirements of machine parts, manufactured at their workshop using a robotic arm. The team also demonstrated work on buildings such as toilets and guard rooms constructed with 3D printing technology using a robotic arm. The Commissioner/Secretary said that the UT administration is considering the idea of using robotic arm in the construction of infrastructure, especially in remote areas as the incorporation of robotic technology yields highly accurate results; increases efficiency; enhances safety measures for the workforce; saves time and cuts costs, besides the robotics can be controlled from a safer area thus, eliminating the need to physically access unsafe locations. The use of 3D technology in construction will be sustainable and help achieve the objective of a carbon-neutral Ladakh. It will also quicken the design process. The interactive session with IIT Guwahati and PWD was a fruitful interchange of ideas on the newly emerging 3D technology and also familiarised the engineers of Ladakh with this emerging technology.
