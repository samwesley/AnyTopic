Adam Savage’s Starchild from 2001: A Space Odyssey! «  Adafruit Industries – Makers, hackers, artists, designers and engineers!
It’s no secret that here at Adafruit we are bigtime fans of Adam Savage’s Tested series. There are awesome new videos all the time, but the archives are also rich with gems. Recently, we enjoyed this 2018 episode that centers on a Starchild prop replica build. See the full video here.Adam shares the story of a recently completed project: an accurate replica of the Starchild prop seen at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The journey to making this prop involved collaborations with effects artist Steve Neill, finishing work by Tested’s Kayte Sabicer, and electronics by Jeremy Williams! Keep an eye on it’s hypnotic gaze! It’s no secret that here at Adafruit we are bigtime fans of Adam Savage’s Tested series.
