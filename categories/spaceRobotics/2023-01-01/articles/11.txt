The title of “hottest thing in the market” usually changes hands a lot. In the race to sit at the top of the industry, competition is expected to be fierce. Bitcoin (BTC) is sitting comfortably at the top and other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) are trying to get as close as they can. Rocketize (JATO) seems to be on a hot streak and dominant cryptocurrencies like this do not show up often. Rocketize (JATO) has been dominating other meme coins and now it wants to target the major players in the crypto industry.

Rocketize also has the “Atomic Nation”, its community which it is building to become the largest one in the crypto industry. The Atomic Nation is the backbone of Rocketize (JATO) and with their help, Rocketize (JATO) might become unstoppable. Members of the Atomic Nation will also receive rewards because half of all taxes collected on fees will be shared among Rocketize (JATO) holders.

The creation of Bitcoin (BTC) also gave people an easy, cheap, and very fast way to perform international transactions. Bitcoin (BTC) gave a lot to its users and it still has a lot more to offer to anyone interested in hopping on the Bitcoin train.  Solana (SOL) became a member of the crypto industry in 2020 and was able to garner a lot of attention thanks to its stellar blockchain. The highly efficient and open-source Solana blockchain was built to help increase smart contract adoption. To achieve this, Solana employs a combination of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-History (PoH) consensuses. With this, it can handle up to 50,000 transactions every second. Solana (SOL) is also a direct rival to Ethereum (ETH) and it is one of the Ethereum Killers. Its blockchain supports smart contracts, building Decentralized Applications (dApps), and it has also started taking Non-Fungible Token (NFT) lovers away from Ethereum. Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s creator, has built something special and the rate at which Solana (SOL) is growing proves that. Rocketize (JATO) is more dominant than a lot of analysts expect and now it has new targets: Solana (SOL), and the king, Bitcoin (BTC). If Rocketize (JATO) can keep going like this, it could soon become the cryptocurrency others are trying to overthrow.
