        "summary": " \n\nBig tech companies like Google and Facebook's parent company, Alphabet, are increasingly abandoning their leased premises in Europe due to higher interest rates and an increased desire for home working. This trend is resulting in a significant drop of demand for office space, causing property investors to take a hit and London office space values could potentially fall by one-third over the next couple of years. However, this news has been partially offset by TikTok's insistence that staff work from offices two to three days per week."
