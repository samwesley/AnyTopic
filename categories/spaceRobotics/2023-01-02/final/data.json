New Mastodon users daily in the last three months of 2022 Elon Musk's first few months as CEO of Twitter have been great news for one social media network. No, not Twitter. The unexpected breakout star of social media in 2022 is instead a free, decentralized, loosely organized group of servers that collectively make up the Fediverse, short for federated universe. Many apps coexist on the Fediverse, using the ActivityPub protocol for sharing content. But the hottest of them all right now is the open-source Mastodon software that powers the Twitter-like social media service on that collection of servers. Also: I started my own Mastodon server on a Raspberry Pi. Here's what I learned It's difficult for most consumers to wrap their minds around the concept of the Fediverse, which has a lot of technical jargon and wonkiness associated with it. Arguably, though, it's not that different from the way modern email services work. Each server runs the same core software, and all the servers know how to talk to each other. Crucially, each user has an identity on a single server. If that identity is an email address at Gmail.com, you can exchange email messages with folks on other servers that support the same protocols. Mastodon works like that, with one crucial difference. You can't go to a massive, centralized server run by a megacorporation to sign up. Instead, you have to find a server on your own, set up an account, and hope that the server you choose can handle the pressure as all these newbies sign up. For a hint of just how fast the Mastodon community has grown, look at the above chart assembled by Esteban Moro (@estebanmoro@mastodon.social), an MIT researcher and associate professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Mastodon servers have strained under the stress of these multiple waves of migration, with users occasionally reporting long wait times before an email confirmation arrives and similarly long delays in getting those accounts properly set up. But things have generally settled down since the initial flurry of activity at the beginning of November. Also: Mastodon FAQ But if you can clear that hurdle, you end up at a place that looks an awful lot like Twitter. And it's growing at an eye-popping pace. In the first week of November, according to Mastodon CEO Eugen Rochko, roughly half a million new users signed up, and the number of monthly active users across all Mastodon servers crossed the 1 million mark for the first time. In roughly six weeks since then, another 1.5 million new users have signed up. A Mastodon post looks reassuringly similar to a tweet, but there are subtle differences. As you can see from that post, Mastodon looks a lot like Twitter, but it's not Twitter. Obvious similarities include the scrolling timeline that shows activities from the people you follow. Tweets are called posts (they used to be called toots, but thankfully that cringeworthy name is on the way out as of the Mastodon 4.0 release). If you share someone else's post, you've reblogged or boosted it. There are hashtags and lists as well. Also: The persona illusion: Do you actually exist on social media? Your Mastodon handle includes your full identity, complete with the server name. At Twitter, I am @edbott, but in the Fediverse I am @edbott@mastodon.social. If you want a checkmark alongside your name to prove that you are who you say you are, you don't have to pay anyone; instead, you add a link to a website that's under your control, and that serves as verification. Oh, and you can edit your posts, again without having to pay for the privilege. The biggest benefit of this decentralized setup is that every server gets to set its own moderation policy and decide which servers it will federate with. People who like NSFW content and hate speech can set up their own server and spout off all they want, with the rest of the Fediverse ignoring them. If all this sounds interesting, you can establish your own identity and check things out for yourself. I recommend doing this setup on a desktop PC or Mac. You can set up a mobile app later, but getting started is much easier if you use a plain ol' browser window, where all the necessary controls are available. The first step is quite literally the hardest. You need to find the address of a server running the Mastodon software (called an instance) and accepting new sign-ups. As with most things in life, the best way to find a reliable instance is to ask a friend for a recommendation and, if necessary, an invitation. If that option isn't available, find a public instance. (Not sure who you know is on Mastodon? Skip ahead to Step 5, where you can use one of several apps to look through the list of Twitter accounts you follow to produce an easy-to-read list.) Although you can go to the official site, https://joinmastodon.org, and look up a server there, that's a recipe for frustration. That list is short and currently shows only a handful of servers that are open. Instead, I recommend going to https://instances.social and using either their wizard or their more advanced search tool. As an alternative, try going to the Mastodon activity page and look at the list under the Instances heading. The entries at the top of the list are the most popular. Go to the instance you chose and, assuming they're accepting membership, fill in the form. Most people probably want to reuse their Twitter ID, but you're free to join with any ID you choose. Here's the sign-up screen for the instance at c.im.  The most time-consuming part of signing up for a Mastodon account is waiting for the confirmation email. (Don't worry, it's easy enough to move your account to a different server later, as I explain in this follow-up post. A word of caution, though: you probably should make that move before you build up much of a posting history, because those posts won't follow you to the new server.) Click Sign Up and wait for the confirmation email. That could take minutes or hours. With the current surge in sign-ups, some people are reporting they never receive the email to activate their account. Also: How to delete your Twitter account And when you do get signed up, make a note of which instance you used. You'll need to enter that server's address when you sign in using a different browser or another mobile app. You can't use those credentials to sign in on a different instance. Once you've confirmed your account, use the Edit Profile button to add some details about who you are. Fill in your bio (copy and paste your Twitter bio, if you want) and add a picture, so that people will know it's you. Hint: In Mastodon, your profile picture is called an avatar. This is also a good time to turn on 2-factor authentication for your account. Add your Mastodon handle to your Twitter bio. That will make it easier for people who know you from Twitter to find you in the new place. You are now ready to follow some folks. If you've got Mastodon IDs for people you know are active here, type that name in the search box to find their account and follow them. (Remember that you might need the full ID with username and server, like @edbott@mastodon.social.) One thing I've seen a lot of people do is write a post giving some background about who they are and what they're interested in, then pin the post to the top of their profile. That's a nice thing to do to help people who find you online figure out if you're an appropriate follow for them. An astonishing number of the accounts I follow on Twitter have set up accounts on Mastodon, and quite a few of them are putting more effort into Mastodon than Twitter. Part of that is just the newness of the Fediverse, perhaps, but it also means you're likely to find some familiar faces in the new place. You can find lots of lists of people who've made the #TwitterMigration, which is also a hashtag worth searching for. Chances are someone you follow has put together a list like that. When I typed lists in the search box, I got a few interesting results; your mileage may vary. To supercharge the process, though, use an app to   search the accounts you follow for signs of a Mastodon ID. The Debirdify app, for example, uses the Twitter API to find accounts that have added Mastodon details to their handle, bio, or other locations. (This is another reason why you should update your Twitter bio to include your address in the Fediverse.) You can go through the results manually, but it's much more productive to export the Debirdify list in CSV (comma-separated values) format and then import it from the Settings page in your Mastodon instance. There's also Fedifinder, which extracts the fediverse handles of Twitter accounts you follow as well as those you've added to a list; you can import that list on Mastodon to follow all those accounts at once. I haven't used it myself, but several people I trust have recommended Movetodon.org as well.  You can now poke around in the Fediverse to your heart's content. Here are a few getting-started notes: Don't try to do everything you did in Twitter. The means of interacting are noticeably different. There's no equivalent to quote-tweeting, for example, and there's no algorithm deciding what you see. There's also, for now at least, a lot of help for new arrivals and a lot of introductions from people just setting up their accounts. Turn on 2FA. Please. I said this earlier but it bears repeating. Turn on 2-factor authentication to secure your account. It only takes a few seconds. (And don't forget to print out your backup codes just in case.) Be extra careful with direct messages in Mastodon. They're not encrypted, and (just as is true on Twitter and other social media platforms) server admins can see them, so it's best not to use them for any important or sensitive business. Mastodon's odd way of creating a direct message (it's a regular post, but you set it so it's only visible to people who are mentioned) makes it all too easy to accidentally make a private message public or bring in a third-party by mentioning them. That can be awkward if the mention is unflattering. And this really just scratches the surface. The best way to get started is simply to sign up and start exploring.

A team of researchers from North Carolina State University has developed tiny robots that can move when hit by infrared (IR) light or subjected to high temperatures. Known as Ringbots, the circular robots can also move tiny payloads across surfaces on air and underwater and pass through gaps smaller than the robots themselves. The Ringbots were designed using liquid crystal elastomers in the shape of a bracelet-like looping ribbon. The segment of the ribbon touching the surface compresses when placed on a surface that is 55\u00b0C (131\u00b0F) hotter than ambient temperatures, while the portion exposed to the air does not. This allows the robots to roll or contort their shape for movement. The same is done using IR. For example, when an IR beam hits a portion of the ring, it begins a rolling motion while the other portion not hit with IR remains unchanged, enabling the robot to roll in the contorted direction. This means that the robots move from the bottom up when placed on a hot surface, while movement begins from the top down when exposed to IR light. The robot\u2019s motion is described as being in a bistable state, meaning there are two shapes when it\u2019s at rest. If the ribbon begins to twist, it will either snap back to its original shape or forward into the other bistable state, turning itself inside out. The researchers demonstrated that the Ringbots could adapt their body shape enough to squeeze through a confined space 30% narrower than their diameter.  \u201cThis is a fundamental advance, not something designed with a specific application in mind,\u201d explains Yao Zhao, a postdoctoral researcher at NC State. \u201cWe are demonstrating what can be accomplished when \u2018physical intelligence\u2019 is engineered into the material and the design of the structure itself, teaming it to move and navigate space without computational input.\u201d Hackster.io, an Avnet Community \u00a9 2023", "Ringbots Can Move When Subjected to IR LightNC State researchers created a ring-shaped soft robot capable of crawling across surfaces when exposed to elevated temperatures or IR light.Cabe AtwellFollow2 minutes ago \u2022 RoboticsThe small Ringbots can also take advantage of high temperatures to move and carry tiny payloads across surfaces.

According to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Beijing may establish a foothold and try to dominate the most resource-rich places on the lunar surface or block the US entirely. \u201cIt is a fact: we\u2019re in a space race,\u201d Nelson said in an interview. \u201cAnd it is true that we better watch out that they don\u2019t get to a place on the moon under the guise of scientific research. And it is not beyond the realm of possibility that they say, \u2018Keep out, we\u2019re here, this is our territory.\u2019\u201d These concerns have arisen less than a month after three Chinese astronauts returned from a six-month expedition in which they assisted in developing and launching a new space station. Nelson used the South China Sea, where the Chinese military has established bases on disputed islands. \u201cIf you doubt that, look at what they did with the Spratly Islands.\u201d China has claimed the contentious Spratly Islands and has exploited them to stockpile armaments and other buildings potentially large enough to house ballistic missile launchers. NASA and China\u2019s space programs are both working hard to reach the moon in the next years and have spent recent months doing just that. NASA\u2019s 26-day Artemis I mission was successful after an Orion capsule orbited the moon, bringing the space agency one step closer to its objective of establishing a human presence on the moon. According to predictions, NASA\u2019s mission might be successful as early as 2025. However, Nelson\u2019s worries may be magnified by Congress\u2019 approval of a budget that does not include the full funding requested by the agency. Despite not receiving the total budget, Nelson stated that the agency would continue to support its most essential assets, including the future Artemis II and Artemis III moon missions. The main concern is that any future NASA missions delays could put the United States behind China. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that they could catch up and surpass us.\u201d \u201cThe progress they\u2019ve made has been stunning \u2014 stunningly fast,\u201d Armagno said. China has dispatched orbiters, landers, and rovers to the moon and Mars in the previous few years alone. \u201cChina has had enormous success and advances in the last decade,\u201d Nelson said. Another primary concern is that China\u2019s broader space objectives may involve tampering with US space systems. According to a former commander of the International Space Station, the country that wins the space race will benefit significantly from it. \u201cOn one level, it is a political competition to show whose system works better. What they want is respect as the world\u2019s top country. They want to be the dominant power on Earth, so going to the moon is a way to show their system is working. If they beat us back to the moon, it shows they are better than us,\u201d said Terry Virts, the former commander of the International Space Station. However, Nelson feels that with the approval of $24.5 billion for 2023, NASA will be able to cover the essentials. The goal for the next Artemis mission is to get it operating \u2018within two years,\u2019 according to Nelson. \u201cHopefully, we can speed that up,\u201d he said, sharing that the agency hopes to send a crew into the moon\u2019s orbit by 2024. That goal may be ambitious, however, as Nelson told Politico. \u201cThe good Lord willing,\u201d said Nelson when asked if the U.S. would make it back to the moon before China.

Robotics company Aerones saves time and the human workforce by cleaning and inspecting wind turbines with remote-controlled robots. For the blades of wind turbines, erosion is a huge problem. The blade surface ages gradually due to small airborne particles, ice, snow, and rain. It harms the turbine blade's aerodynamics over time by wearing off the outer layer of the blade. Over the course of the turbine's lifetime, less and less energy is produced as a result. As a result, regular wind turbine blade maintenance is crucial to maintaining the blades' structural integrity and extending the machines' life. According to Aerones, its robots can save downtime on wind turbines by four to six times and reduce downtime by five to ten times, thus increasing the annual energy production by 12 percent. Turbine downtime rises due to larger turbines, and blades are harder to maintain using traditional techniques. Each hour a turbine is not in operation costs more and more money as power prices rise. The building block of the base platform of the Aerones Wind Turbine Leading Edge Repair Robot is the modular toolkit. This winch system allows controls in both vertical and horizontal spaces.

While some of us are still musing on New Year\u2019s resolutions (we have the tech to help you right here), will 2023 be the year you finally break up with Twitter? There\u2019s never been a better time. All this Elon Musk-induced chaos has breathed new life into the numerous Twitter alternatives. Of all of them, Mastodon has probably benefited the most. The open-source service gained notoriety back in 2017 when some Twitter users were upset with changes the company had made to the functionality of @-replies. (Back then, that was a big deal.) Mastodon isn\u2019t the only app to get a boost from the turmoil at Twitter, though. Other apps like CounterSocial, which has a Tweetdeck-like interface, and Tribel have also seen increased user numbers. There are some new upstarts, too. Post News, a new service from former Waze CEO Noam Bardin, has also tried to capitalize on Twitter\u2019s current state. Meanwhile, Twitter hasn\u2019t been paying its office rent in San Francisco. According to Bloomberg, Twitter was told on December 16th that it would default on its lease for the 30th floor of the Hartford Building. So far, it\u2019s failed to pay $136,250 in rent. \u2013 Mat Smith The Morning After isn\u2019t just a newsletter \u2013  it\u2019s also a daily podcast.

Karnataka is often regarded as India\u2019s aerospace capital, but Tamil Nadu has a chance to fly ahead with drones. It has set up the Tamil Nadu UAV Corporation, plans to build a drone-focused research park, and the focus of its aerospace policy is drones. Industry players and policymakers spoke to say the state has the academic foundation needed for R&D with the Centre for Aerospace Research at the Madras Institute of Technology and facilities at IIT Madras. The most well-funded among Indian drone startups is Garuda Aerospace, which hails from Chennai and is on the path to becoming the sector\u2019s first unicorn. Experts say Chennai\u2019s existing SaaS (software as a service) sector could also help power drones. \u201cRight from the beginning, there has been a focus on this area with the Centre for Aerospace Research producing drones with the financial assistance of the state government under the Tamil Nadu Innovation Initiative. The state government has also invested \u20b9 20 crores in the Tamil Nadu UAV Corporation,\u201d says industries secretary S Krishnan. In another key move, the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited (TIDCO) is setting up UAV-focused research and testing centers. At a conference in Chennai recently, B Krishnamoorthy, additional secretary, and project director, TIDCO, said three major testing facilities \u2013 for drones, electronic warfare, and electronic optics \u2013 will be commissioned in the next six months in Tamil Nadu. The facility for UAVs will come up at Vallam Vadagal near Chennai. Additionally, the state has a supply chain advantage. Its expertise in precision manufacturing, and experience of private firms in developing and manufacturing aircraft standard parts and engine components for global OEMs and HAL, make it the hub for sourcing drone components. Industry executives said that the drone manufacturing sector sources 40%-45% of the components domestically, and almost 50% of that is from Tamil Nadu. This is one reason why Bengaluru\u2019s headquartered drone maker Magic Myna is establishing an R&D and manufacturing facility at Coimbatore. \u201cWe are looking at procuring at least 70% of the components required to manufacture drones indigenously. Coimbatore with an existing manufacturing and allied ecosystem, including a well-established MSME platform, is well placed to foster the development of drone manufacturing,\u201d says Sunil S Nair, co-founder, of Magic Myna. Manufacturing 30-plus types of drones, and expanding its facility in Chennai in partnership with TIDCO, Garuda Aerospace wants to lead India\u2019s drone revolution. \u201cOur ambition is to build a drone park like how the TIDEL Park is for the IT industry. We plan to do this across 5-6 acres in Chennai, with R&D centers and manufacturing footprint side by side,\u201d says Agnishwar Jayaprakash, founder and CEO, of Garuda Aerospace.  The startup has served more than 750 clients including TATA, Godrej, Adani, Reliance, Swiggy, and Flipkart. It also recently became the first in the sector to receive a double certification from DGCA for its indigenously designed Kisan drones. As the use of drones by the government and industry grows, so does the demand for drone pilots.Tamil Nadu is also playing a proactive role in creating a pipeline for this. Four of around 30 DGCA-approved remote pilot training organizations (RPTO) are in Tamil Nadu, with Garuda Aerospace having trained 2,000 pilots in its first batch. The MIT campus of Anna University, which also holds a license, recently said it plans to start drone flying training centers across the state to cater to rising demand. It\u2019s just a matter of time before drone use is mainstream, Vanitha Venugopal, a chief business officer of Tamil Nadu UAV Corporation, said at a recent business summit. \u201cUnlike smartphones that are a pull technology and easier to operate, drones are currently a push technology and the focus is on creating awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cBusinesses in the south are more progressive when it comes to the use of drones. TN\u2019s agriculture and media sectors are one of the largest adopters,\u201d says Garuda\u2019s Jayaprakash We at The Robotics India want to create a Robotics ecosystem in India.

Most of their users are either running research projects or simply gaining experience with programming on the systems in the expectation that a future computer will be useful. There are quantum systems based on superconducting hardware that are being used commercially; it's just that they're not general-purpose computers. D-Wave offers what's called a quantum annealer. The hardware is a large collection of linked superconducting devices that use quantum effects to reach energetic ground states for the system. When properly configured, this end state represents the solution to a mathematical problem. Annealers can't solve the same full range of mathematical problems as general-purpose quantum computers, such as the ones made by Google, IBM, and others. But they can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. While the systems can suffer from errors, the consequences are relatively minor, as they tend to leave the systems with a solution that is mathematically close to an optimal one. Unlike with general-purpose quantum computers, it hasn't been mathematically demonstrated that quantum annealers can consistently outperform traditional computers. But unlike general-purpose quantum computers, they have for several years had a high numbers of bits, good connectivity, and reasonable error rates. And a number of companies are now using them to solve real-world problems. One of the companies that relies on D-Wave's hardware is POLARISqb, which works in the field of drug discovery, identifying potential drug molecules in software for companies to test them in biological systems. Its general approach is widespread in the pharmaceutical industry: identify a disease caused by inappropriate activity of a protein, then find a molecule that alters the protein's function in a way that relieves the disease. If you know the three-dimensional structure of the protein and which parts of the protein are needed for its functions, you can use computer modeling to see how well drug molecules latch on to that part. That sort of modeling is computationally expensive, but it's still cheaper than synthesizing the molecule and testing it on cells. It's also part of POLARISqb's process\u2014but it comes after using a quantum annealer, which is used to identify molecules to test with detailed modeling. \"We design a virtual large chemical space, and we use a quantum computer to search that chemical space to find the best molecules,\" POLARISqb founder Shahar Keinan told Ars. The concept of \"best\" here goes well beyond molecules simply latching onto a protein well. \"We're not just looking for molecules that have a single property; we're looking for molecules that will have a whole profile of properties that will give us what we're looking for,\" Keinan said. \"The molecule cannot be too big or too small; the molecule has to be soluble enough, but not too soluble. The molecule has to have certain properties, like a number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.\" It also has to be something that can be synthesized relatively easily.

The molecule has to have certain properties, like a number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.\" It also has to be something that can be synthesized relatively easily.\n\nPage: 1 2 3 Next \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreader comments\n61\n with 0 posters participating\n\n\nShare this story\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Timmer\n      John became Ars Technica's science editor in 2007 after spending 15 years doing biology research at places like Berkeley and Cornell.     \n\nEmail jtimmer@arstechnica.com\n//\nTwitter @j_timmer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChannel Ars Technica\n\n\n\n\n\u2190 Previous story Next story \u2192\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday on Ars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "", "", ""], "prompt": [], "summary": [], "blockWordCount": ["4069", "4167", "0", "0", "0"]}}, "12": {"title": "No Title", "link": "https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2023/01/02/mass-companies-participating-at-ces-2023.html", "html": " ", "article": {"htmlTag": ["p", "article", "id=\"article-body\"", "class_=\"caas-body\"", "itemprop=\"articleBody\""], "block": ["", "", "", "", ""], "prompt": [], "summary": [], "blockWordCount": ["0", "0", "0", "0", "0"]}}, "13": {"title": "Space Power Electronics Market to Grow at Double Digits until", "link": "https://www.openpr.com/news/2867736/space-power-electronics-market-to-grow-at-double-digits-until", "html": " ", "article": {"htmlTag": ["p", "article", "id=\"article-body\"", "class_=\"caas-body\"", "itemprop=\"articleBody\""], "block": ["Space Power Electronics Market  Permanent link to this press release:  \n\n\n\n\n\n Delete press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Edit press release\n\n  All 5 Releases", "", "", "", ""], "prompt": [], "summary": [], "blockWordCount": ["142", "0", "0", "0", "0"]}}, "14": {"title": "Drain-Cleaning Robots Will help Tiruchy Sewage Workers - Robotics India Live", "link": "https://roboticsindia.live/drain-cleaning-robots-will-help-tiruchy-sewage-workers/", "html": " ", "article": {"htmlTag": ["p", "article", "id=\"article-body\"", "class_=\"caas-body\"", "itemprop=\"articleBody\""], "block": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRobotics India Live\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Drain-Cleaning Robot Will help Tiruchy Sewage Workers The Tiruchy City corporation is set to blaze a new trail by adopting robotic technology to assist in the completion of the underground drainage (UGD) system works across the city.

That is why I asked GPT (OpenAI Playground) what its top predictions for 2023 will be. Although GPT does not know what happened in 2022 (since it was last updated about some 2021 events), I liked reading its predictions and decided to share them with you below. I have run several experiments and did several iterations. You will see my prompts, and the responses provided by GPT below. I have tried to cover diverse areas such as technology, global issues, politics, economics, business, culture, and entertainment. Although some predictions are somewhat lame and underwhelming, it was still refreshing to read them because of their wide scope and holistic perspective. What do you think of these responses?

Credit: Jaren Wilkey, BYU PhotoOne might easily think that robots are causing significant disruption in the labor market by replacing human workers, especially when considering examples like chatbots serving as more efficient customer service representatives or computer programs handling package tracking and transportation without human intervention.According to a study by Eric Dahlin, a sociology professor at Brigham Young University, there is no need to fear an imminent robot takeover of jobs. Dahlin\u2019s research suggests that the rate at which robots are replacing humans is not as high as many people believe and that people tend to greatly overestimate the extent to which robots are taking over the workforce.The study, recently published in the journal Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World, found that only 14% of workers say they\u2019ve seen their job replaced by a robot. But those who have experienced job displacement due to a robot overstate the effect of robots taking jobs from humans by about three times.To understand the relationship between job loss and robots, Dahlin surveyed nearly 2,000 individuals about their perceptions of jobs being replaced by robots. Respondents were first asked to estimate the percentage of employees whose employers have replaced jobs with robots. They were then asked whether their employer had ever replaced their job with a robot.Those who had been replaced by a robot (about 14%), estimated that 47% of all jobs have been taken over by robots. Similarly, those who hadn\u2019t experienced job replacement still estimated that 29% of jobs have been supplanted by robots.\u201cOverall, our perceptions of robots taking over is greatly exaggerated,\u201d said Dahlin. \u201cThose who hadn\u2019t lost jobs overestimated by about double, and those who had lost jobs overestimated by about three times.\u201dOnly 14% of workers say their job has been replaced by a robot. Those who have experienced job displacement overstate the effect of robot takeover by about three times. Credit: Jaren Wilkey, BYU PhotoAttention-grabbing headlines predicting a dire future of employment have likely overblown the threat of robots taking over jobs, said Dahlin, who noted that humans\u2019 fear of being replaced by automated work processes dates to the early 1800s.\u201cWe expect novel technologies to be adopted without considering all of the relevant contextual impediments such as cultural, economic, and government arrangements that support the manufacturing, sale, and use of the technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut just because a technology can be used for something does not mean that it will be implemented.\u201dDahlin says these findings are consistent with previous studies, which suggest that robots aren\u2019t displacing workers. Rather, workplaces are integrating both employees and robots in ways that generate more value for human labor.\u201cAn everyday example is an autonomous, self-propelled machine roaming the isles and cleaning floors at your local grocery store,\u201d says Dahlin. \u201cThis robot cleans the floors while employees clean under shelves or other difficult-to-reach places.\u201dDahlin says the aviation industry is another good example of robots and humans working together. Airplane manufacturers used robots to paint airplane wings. A robot can administer one coat of paint in 24 minutes \u2013 something that would take a human painter hours to accomplish. Humans load and unload the paint while the robot does the painting.Reference: \u201cAre Robots Really Stealing Our Jobs?

Perception versus Experience\u201d by Eric Dahlin, 17 October 2022, Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World.DOI: 10.1177/23780231221131377 According to a study by Eric Dahlin, a sociology professor at Brigham Young University, there is no need to fear an imminent robot takeover of jobs. Dahlin\u2019s research suggests that the rate at which robots are replacing humans is not as high as many people believe and that people tend to greatly overestimate the extent to which robots are taking over the workforce. The study, recently published in the journal Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World, found that only 14% of workers say they\u2019ve seen their job replaced by a robot. But those who have experienced job displacement due to a robot overstate the effect of robots taking jobs from humans by about three times.To understand the relationship between job loss and robots, Dahlin surveyed nearly 2,000 individuals about their perceptions of jobs being replaced by robots. Respondents were first asked to estimate the percentage of employees whose employers have replaced jobs with robots. They were then asked whether their employer had ever replaced their job with a robot.Those who had been replaced by a robot (about 14%), estimated that 47% of all jobs have been taken over by robots. Similarly, those who hadn\u2019t experienced job replacement still estimated that 29% of jobs have been supplanted by robots.\u201cOverall, our perceptions of robots taking over is greatly exaggerated,\u201d said Dahlin. \u201cThose who hadn\u2019t lost jobs overestimated by about double, and those who had lost jobs overestimated by about three times.\u201dOnly 14% of workers say their job has been replaced by a robot.
