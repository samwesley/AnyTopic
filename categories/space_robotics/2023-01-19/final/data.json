            "text": "Come Feb. 1, founders of robotics startups \u2014 or in some cases, robotics-adjacent startups \u2014 will be able to apply to the Innovation Works-led Robotics Factory.\n\nIn fall 2022, the Pittsburgh region was announced as the recipient of $62.7 million in grants from the $1 billion Build Back Better Regional Challenge administered by the US Economic Development Administration (EDA). Innovation Works, the North Side-based early-stage investment org, would receive $12 million of that to launch the Robotics Factory. The program aims to support the creation of companies that produce their own products, focusing on robotics and automation in industry sectors including agriculture, construction, mining, energy, warehousing and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to create companies that are developing products that can be produced in Western Pennsylvania \u2014 not just produced in China, and not just produced somewhere else,\u201d Innovation Works\u2019 Mike Formica told Technical.ly in September. Formica is the managing director of hardware and AlphaLab Gear, Innovation Works\u2019 hardware accelerator program, and is leading the Robotics Factory project.\n\nNow, with the application date in place, Innovations Works and its partners on this project are reaffirming their vision for the Factory. At the time the project was announced, Formica explained that they wanted to set up robotics companies to thrive in the long term, as well as give individuals currently still underrepresented in the field a shot at employment and wealth creation in the region.\n\n\u201cNot only will the Robotics Factory programs address existing problems experienced by industries that can be solved using robotics and automation solutions, we plan to also provide the resources and funding that are so critical to emerging companies,\u201d said Ven Raju, president and CEO of Innovation Works, in a statement this week. \u201cTogether, the Robotics Factory Create, Accelerate and Scale programs will be dynamic additions to one of the region\u2019s most important economic engines.\u201d\n\nInnovation Works has pledged that during the four years of the EDA\u2019s funding, it\u2019ll be matching a portion by providing additional operating and investment capital to participating startups. The Factory has a few parts, for companies at different stages:\n\nIts Create program connects early-stage entrepreneurs in this space with industry experts and relevant workshops.\n\nThe Accelerate program will offer six startups up to $100,000 in pre-seed money during a seven-month accelerator.\n\nThe Scale program will help startups develop prototypes and access services that help them advance their products.\n\nAs a part of the Pittsburgh Robotics Network\u2019s mission to develop business opportunities for the city\u2019s robotics industry, that org will help Innovation Works market these programs.\n\nIn September, Formica observed that one of the issues the pandemic highlighted was that many companies are almost entirely dependent on entities outside of the US to fill their manufacturing needs. This can create problems, he said, because in cases of transportation shortages or labor issues, companies can find themselves unable to get their products out into the world in an efficient and cost-effective manner. By teaching company leaders to build cultures of self sufficiency, the goal is to avoid predicaments similar to those faced in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe skilled team and specific capabilities of the Robotics Factory programs will make meaningful connections that benefit both emerging startups and the thousands of manufacturers in the region,\u201d Formica said this week. \u201cBy starting and growing companies that build their products locally, we provide opportunities for broader regional job growth.\u201d\n\nIf any of this sounds like something that could benefit your startup (or help you launch one), learn more about the application and the program here.\n\nThese Build Back Better projects were also announced in fall 2022:\n\nRobotics Manufacturing Hub led by Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute\n\nExpanded Pathways to Entrepreneurship led by InnovatePGH\n\nSmall & Medium Enterprises (SME) Robotics Adoption led by Catalyst Connection\n\nExpanded Pathways to New Economy Careers led by Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission\n\n-30-",

            "text": "Planning is advancing to create the world\u2019s first solar energy station in space, capturing the sun\u2019s rays 24 hours a day and providing the planet with a clean power source.\n\nThe futuristic project, which if successful could have a major impact on combating climate change, is being developed by British firm Space Solar, with financial support from Saudi Arabia.\n\nWithin six years, Space Solar aims to have a trial project providing six megawatts of power from low Earth orbit, eventually leading to a two-gigawatt power station in high geostationary orbit by 2035.\n\nSam Adlen, joint chief executive of Space Solar, welcomed the collaboration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real partnership to be developed that can have a huge impact on the future of net zero, energy security and help create an era-defining, new energy source,\u201d he said. \"Space-based solar power is the ultimate form of clean, dependable energy and our vision is for clean, affordable energy from space.\"\n\nWith the race for cosmic energy potentially highly lucrative, UK Business Secretary Grant Shapps suggested that \u201ccollaboration in space\u201d could \u201cunlock significant commercial opportunities\u201d.\n\nHe travelled to Saudi Arabia last week to meet Abdullah Al Swaha, Minister of Communications and chairman of the Saudi Space Commission.\n\nScience fact\n\nFor almost a century, the idea of using sonar panels in space to beam electricity down to Earth has largely been in the imagination, with Isaac Asimov writing a short story on the idea in 1941 before a more serious proposal in the 1960s.\n\nFantasy is now turning into reality.\n\n\u201cThis has been science fiction for decades,\u201d space systems architect Matt O\u2019Donnell told The National.\n\n\u201cThe calculations around the physics involved with the distances does require very, very large structures in space, building something that's truly enormous, the largest structure ever built by mankind.\u201d\n\nRead More Britain enjoys green energy boost with second best year\n\nViable space\n\nOnce the technology is developed and tested with smaller models, the power stations in space would cost the equivalent of a nuclear plant to build \u2014 about $10 billion \u2014 with a similar output of two gigawatts, enough to power more than 1.5 million homes.\n\nWith 5km-wide solar panels and at several times the size of the International Space Station, the structure would have to be assembled in space, with parts sent up via numerous rocket launches.\n\nBut that is becoming more financially viable, with the returnable rockets of SpaceX missions bringing down the costs.\n\nWith 5km-wide solar panels and- at several times the size of the International Space Station above, the structure would have to be assembled in space, with parts sent up via numerous rocket launches. AP\n\nA British government study has already concluded that space-based solar energy is viable. Another report from Nasa on the subject will be released later this year.\n\n\u201cThat makes it look like a believable concept to the energy people who have got massive contracts to build and run enormous terrestrial power stations safe and well,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Donnell, of the global aerospace firm Airbus.\n\n\u201cWith the gradual reduction in launch prices and hardware costs and improvements in putting robotics into space, the feeling is that with those three things we're on the cusp, where it could become technologically and economically viable within the next decade, but in order to get to that point we need to start now.\u201d\n\nSpace Solar, based near Oxford, also argued that the government studies confirmed that the space energy is now technically viable and economically competitive with other renewables.\n\n\u201cIt has low environmental impact, in land usage, carbon footprint and mineral resources,\u201d its website stated. \u201cThe technology is highly flexible and can export energy to other co-operating nations without expensive fixed infrastructure such as underwater power cables. It can be switched rapidly to power hydrogen generation or water desalination plants, as well as providing electricity into the grid.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nSpace Solar says the system comprises a kilometre-scale satellite in a high Earth orbit. It features lightweight solar panels and a system of mirrors to concentrate sunlight on to the panels.\n\nThe electricity generated is converted into high-frequency radio waves and the power is beamed to a receiving antenna at a fixed point on the ground below.\n\nA ground receiver would likely be the North Sea, but it could also be in the futuristic city of Neom, the metropolis in north-west Saudi Arabia that will be entirely powered by carbon-free electricity.\n\nThe spacecraft\u2019s solar array could easily be redirected from the North Sea to Neom.\n\nDoubling demand\n\nWith the Earth\u2019s population expected to exceed 10 billion by 2050 \u2014 the date set for net zero in global carbon emissions \u2014 the demands for clean energy are going to be immense.\n\nOne calculation suggests that Britain alone will need a 2km-wide belt of wind farms around its entire coastline to supply clean energy for its 68 million population.\n\nWith at least three billion people in the developing world requiring clean energy rather than fossil fuels \u2014 and that population is set to grow \u2014 the demand for energy globally will be extremely high.\n\n\u201cThey could double especially with increased movement of population into cities and with the rest of the world needing access to good, clean energy,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cWe can't do this with the existing technologies at sufficient scale, so all the ideas need to be on the table, including nuclear, more battery storage and the potential for space-based solar power.\u201d\n\nAirbus interest\n\nAirbus, which manufactures nearly all the world\u2019s aircraft wings as well as commercial and military satellites, has a keen interest in the project.\n\n\u201cWe think it's important for building sustainable societies and the use of space to support the climate,\u201d said its space expert Mr O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cDelivering power from space to replace fossil fuels is a novel way of making a direct contribution. Also, Airbus, as a system-of-systems integrator, understands how supply chains and management of complex things work that have safety of life implications.\u201d\n\nHe added that with continued development in the wider world, billions of people \u201care going to want more energy and they should be given clean energy from the start\u201d.\n\nSaxaVord spaceport \u2014 in pictures",

PBS was among the broadcast television stations that did extended features on Kelly's mission, its multi-episode series was titled \"A year in space.\" But the dirty little secret is that, due to the inevitable shuffling of schedules in spaceflight, Kelly and a Russia colleague, Mikhail Kornienko, spent 340 days in space rather than a full year of 365.25 days.\n\nAfter Kelly's mission, NASA health officials said they hoped to fly more one-year missions as they sought to better understand the biological effects of long-duration spaceflight on humans and how the agency might better mitigate bone loss and other deleterious effects.\n\nThese missions, at least by planning, have not happened. However, largely by the vagaries of scheduling, NASA astronauts have spent long periods of time on the International Space Station since Kelly's pioneering flight.\n\nPeggy Whitson spent 289 days in space from late 2016 to 2017 after her planned six-month mission was extended due to a realignment of Russian launch schedules. Then, from 2019 to 2020, Christina Koch spent nearly 329 days in space. She broke Whitson's record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman and conducted four spacewalks. Koch knew an extended mission was a possibility before she launched in 2019 on a Soyuz vehicle, but the scheduling decision\u2014to free up a Soyuz seat for the United Arab Emirates\u2019 first astronaut, Hazza al-Mansoori\u2014was not made until she was living on board the space station.\n\nWhen Mark Vande Hei launched to the space station in April 2021, he was planning for a six-month mission. But again, the Russians shuffled the schedule in order to use a Soyuz spacecraft to make a movie on the station. So instead of launching a replacement crew on Soyuz MS-19, film director Klim Shipenko and actress Yulia Peresild flew to the station on that spacecraft, along with cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this extended mission, Vande Hei spent 355 days in space and currently holds the record for longest-duration spaceflight by an American astronaut. But still, he did not spend a full year in space.\n\nThat may now finally happen, however. On Tuesday, a senior official in NASA's International Space Station Program, Dina Contella, said during a news briefing that the crew of the damaged Soyuz spacecraft would now \"probably\" come back to Earth in late September.\n\nCosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin and NASA's Frank Rubio launched on the Soyuz MS-22 vehicle on September 21, 2022. The mission was due to return this spring, but after a micrometeorite strike in December, the vehicle's external cooling loop was damaged. (Russian officials are convinced it was a micrometeorite rather than orbit debris due to the high velocity of the strike and its unlikely impact vector.)\n\nAs a result, this three-person crew will now return to Earth on a new Soyuz vehicle, MS-23, that will launch and fly autonomously to the station next month. Because the next Soyuz crew spacecraft will not be ready for flight until the fall, this will delay the launch of a replacement crew. A source said that at present, NASA's internal schedule calls for this Soyuz MS-23 vehicle to return to Earth after September 21, 2023.\n\nWith the caveat that such schedules are invariably fluid and emergencies are always possible, this means Rubio is presently on course to spend more than a full year in space\u2014becoming the first NASA astronaut to do so. It's a nice and unexpected feat for the first-time flyer, who only joined NASA in 2017 and is the space agency's first astronaut of Salvadoran origin.\n\nThe current record for longest-duration spaceflight is out of reach. Valery Polyakov spent 438 days on the Mir space station in the 1990s. This record is unlikely to be broken for a long time. However, if the return of Soyuz MS-23 slips a bit, second place on this list could be in play for Rubio and his two crew mates. That mark is held by cosmonaut Sergey Avdeev, who spent 379 days on Mir in the late 1990s.",

            "text": "Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new, dual-credit robotics class for eighth graders at Douglas MacArthur Middle School is allowing students to dive deep into engineering and other STEM fields while addressing the issue of pandemic learning loss.\n\nWhile the first semester of the inaugural class focused on Lego robotics, the second leg of the 2022-23 school year will teach students to design, build and program a robot. Students also earn high school credit for it as part of a partnership between elementary school District 23 and High School District 214. The partnership started as a joint extracurricular robotics club where students from the feeder schools could participate at the high school level.\n\nAccording to District 23 Superintendent Don Angelaccio, the districts worked together to create a class that had a curriculum and outcome similar to entry-level engineering classes at the high schools.\n\nAnd coming off a time period of the pandemic that inhibited regular classroom education, the robotics class and STEM education in general, accelerates learning by equipping students with problem-solving skills, Angelaccio said.\n\n\"You have a challenge or a problem you're trying to solve,\" he said. \"You brainstorm solutions, design and test, and then you learn from those successes and failures. It creates a structure around problem-solving that adults use every day.\"\n\nAngelaccio noted the shift in education to applied skills as opposed to the previous emphasis on the theoretical steps of a research project or paper.\n\n\"For several reasons, (the new approach) better meets the needs of this generation of students,\" he said. \"They are tactile, and used to immediate response. So building and testing a robot for example: 'Does it follow the code you wanted it to? Did it turn right or turn left?' You see it immediately and those kinds of things help kids learn from the actual testing of things.\"\n\nThe dual-credit class has no prerequisites, but it does have to fit into students' schedules without compromising core classes. If students take band or orchestra and Spanish, for example, they likely won't have space for robotics.\n\nFilip Dudic, who teaches the class of 17 eighth graders, said its obvious why a STEM class might help students bounce back from effects of the pandemic.\n\n\"I think about my younger son and how being home for so long made it hard to go back. Having something to have fun with makes it easier,\" Dudic said. \"There's a lot of choice in STEM classes, a lot of projects, and not necessarily the same thing day to day. If we're doing a 3D printing project, you could be making a keychain or an ornament, or it could be anything.\"\n\nThe robotics class incorporates other subjects like math, which many students struggle to see \"the point of,\" Dudic said.\n\n\"I try to always point out, when we're doing something with 3D modeling or coding, how it relates to what they're going to learn in high school geometry or algebra class,\" Dudic said. \"They like to see the real-world applications. I used to get that question as a math teacher all the time: 'When are we ever going to use this?'\"\n\nDudic said he was fortunate to get STEM-teaching training through the Project Lead the Way curriculum at his previous school, Oliver McCracken Middle School in Skokie District 73.5. Project Lead the Way is one of the leading providers of innovative STEM education curricular programs used in middle and high schools across the U.S., and it's used at High School District 214, where Dudic's middle schoolers are headed.\n\nDistrict 23 also partners with District 214\u2032s WildStang Robotics Program, sharing space at MacArthur with the high school students mentoring the younger kids.\n\nDudic is an assistant coach and teacher for the high school robotics team, allowing him to seamlessly conduct the dual-credit program while keeping an eye on the high school curriculum to better prepare his middle school students.\n\nOnly a few students came to Dudic's robotics class with little or no understanding of STEM. Most sixth graders take Dudic's nine-week applied tech course, which allows him to more quickly move on from the basics into advanced topics.\n\nOne of the eighth graders taking Dudic's Robotics class is Claudia Glinko, who is especially excited about \"graduating\" from the class' first-semester emphasis on Lego robotics to coding a \"real robot.\"\n\n\"It's like we're onto the next level this semester,\" she said. \"We're ready for it and we know we can ask questions and figure it out together.\"\n\nGlinko, who grew up watching her dad use computers and technology to fix car engines, has already started toying with the idea of a career in a STEM field and has plans to take similar classes in high school.\n\n\"You don't realize how many different parts of STEM there are,\" she said. \"Robotics is not just about coding; its about science and math.\"\n\nThe merging of concepts can be beneficial in more ways than one, said MacArthur Middle School Principal Cam Nystrom.\n\n\"Filip is a former math teacher so he always has a math lens to it, and able to bring math concepts that students may have missed out on during the pandemic and make it more of a gap-filler type class the way he's teaching it,\" Nystrom said.\n\nStudents working together and asking each other questions about how they did this or that enriches the learning experience and propels it forward, Nystrom said.\n\nJuliana Firnstein, another student in Dudic's robotics class, said one of the best parts of the course is the \"positive environment.\"\n\n\"It is very fun just to be communicating with a bunch of people and it's all hands-on activities,\" she said. \"We just finished Lego week competitions and are moving on to robot coding, and everyone is working on it together.\"\n\nThrough the class, Firnstein has also become open to the idea of a career in a STEM field.\n\n\"It's definitely made me look into my future and what I'd like to do as a career,\" she said. \"I'm open to the idea of engineering as a career choice. And a future in engineering will involve science and math, too.\"\n\nNystrom said the district hasn't eliminated traditional wood shop classes. A lot of handheld saws and machines have been replaced with 3D printers, but students are welcome to use both.\n\nRobotics was fashioned as a pilot class to see what can be improved, but administrators are hoping to continue it.\n\nNystrom said educators have their eye on a potential merger between the sixth, seventh and eighth grade STEM classes with the art department.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you're making a pot with clay or a 3D printer; there's still elements of design and balance of structure,\" he said.\n\nNystrom said the creative concepts would tap into the STEAM part of education, which stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics.\n\n\"The difference is that arts are included, from visual arts to language arts and more,\" he said. \"It sparks imagination and creativity through the arts in ways that naturally align with STEM learning.\"\n\n2023 Chicago Tribune.\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

            "text": "The last five years have changed the game for European spacetech companies.\n\nInvestors are flocking to the sector they once perceived as too capital intensive with too limited a set of buyers. VC funding for spacetech companies saw a record $2.5bn raised in 2021, according to data gathered by Dealroom.\n\nSure, investment then dipped \u2014 as it did in virtually every other tech field \u2014 to below $1bn in 2022. But space has never been cheaper and easier to access, and VCs are piling cash into startups whose capabilities could power the next several decades of earthly innovation, from almost real-time pictures of climate change effects to the high-speed internet needs of autonomous cars.\n\nTo coincide with the launch of our new spacetech report, Sifted asked some key investors for their top spacetech picks. The one catch \u2014 they couldn\u2019t choose from their own portfolio.\n\nFrom wannabe SpaceX clones to companies hoping to open up the first \u201cspace factories\u201d and grow new tissues and organs off-planet, here are 16 spacetech startups VCs say are ready to blast off.\n\nCandace Johnson, chair of the advisory board at Seraphim Space Fund and vice chair of NorthStar Earth and Space\n\nA serial entrepreneur and investor, Johnson is vice-chair of Canadian satellite constellation startup NorthStar Earth and Space and chair of Seraphim Space Fund\u2019s advisory board.\n\nInterstellar Lab\n\nI am unabashedly supporting women in space with my first two picks. Based in France, CEO Barbara Belvisi and her team are building pods for sustainable life in space. The company aims to build mini greenhouses in low Earth orbit by 2025, the moon by 2027 and Mars by 2030.\n\nThrustMe\n\nI am also looking at this deeptech company, which designs miniaturised thrusters for small satellites, increasing the life of satellites and making them more affordable. I have been mentoring Norwegian CEO Ane Aanesland for quite some years and she is really getting traction with clients now.\n\nInfinite Orbits\n\nEverything to do with in-orbit services (think refuelling and repairing satellites) is exciting and promising, and that\u2019s what Infinite Orbits is working on. I have mentored this Toulouse-based company for five years. Last autumn, the company signed a partnership with [US satellite group] Intelsat. When I first met them, no one believed in in-orbit servicing, which I think can literally give a second life to GEO (geostationary orbit) satellites.\n\nAdam Niewinski, cofounder and general partner at OTB Ventures\n\nOTB Ventures is a VC firm with $300m AUM focused on spacetech, AI and automation, fintech and cybersecurity. Its portfolio includes spacetech companies like Iceye, HydroSat and SpaceKnow.\n\nKurs Orbital\n\nThis company plans to build autonomous rendez-vous and docking systems for the emerging space economy. In the not-so-distant future we can imagine more and more space activities happening \u2014 refuelling and repairing, but also debris removal \u2014 which will require all kinds of vehicles to approach and maybe dock with each other. The team behind Kurs is building on decades of experience gleaned from the Ukrainian Space Agency, which has built similar systems for legacy Soyuz (Russian spacecraft) missions.\n\nSpace Forge\n\nThis UK startup wants to carry out in-space manufacturing of new materials in never-before-seen \u201cspace factories\u201d \u2014 the infrastructure that we\u2019ll need to build after the International Space Station is discontinued after 2030. More precisely, the company wants to take advantage of specific zero gravity conditions to unlock completely new possibilities in semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and alloys.\n\nSatim\n\nThis Polish company uses synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data from satellites \u2014 which, according to NASA\u2019s helpful definition, is \u201ca type of active data collection where a sensor produces its own energy and then records the amount of that energy reflected back after interacting with the Earth\u201d \u2014 to build AI-based advanced analytics products. The signal is responsive to surface-level things like structure and moisture. Its first successful products are for detecting and classifying ships on the ocean.\n\nMaureen Haverty, vice president at Seraphim Space\n\nSeraphim Space was Europe\u2019s first fund to focus on spacetech. It runs an accelerator programme for seed-stage companies while its fund is focused around Series A investing, from proof of concept to scaleup. Portfolio includes D-Orbit, Satellite Vu and All.Space.\n\nEnduroSat\n\nThis company started out making satellite parts at a very affordable price point and has since moved up the value chain to making satellites, and operating them for customers. Now it\u2019s cornering \u201cconstellation-as-a-service\u201d, which involves taking customers\u2019 equipment and sensors and launching them as a distributed platform in space. Great CEO and team here, which have grown into a real market player despite really low funding and its location \u201con the edge of Europe\u201d in Bulgaria.\n\nPolaris Raumflugzeuge\n\nThese guys are developing a reusable space plane and hypersonic transport plane. The CEO is ex-DLR (Germany\u2019s NASA) and has made incredible progress in a very short time with very limited funding. The company demoed a subsonic plane last year, which it built for the German armed forces.\n\nThe Exploration Company\n\nHere\u2019s another really ambitious German company, which is developing a reusable, returnable launch vehicle that can orbit the Earth and moon for several months. The hope is that it can be used to resupply space stations, land on and return from the moon and perform experiments and R&D in space. Led by an impressive female CEO (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Huby), a former VP at Airbus, it\u2019s got a strong European team and customer base.\n\nIsar Aerospac e\n\nThis is a well-backed launch vehicle company \u2014 again German \u2014 which raised several hundred million pounds from some very high-profile people, and has contracts already with Germany\u2019s DLR. Isar develops and builds launch vehicles for transporting small and medium satellites into orbit.\n\nYuri Gravity\n\nThis company conducts biotech R&D in space. Why? The unique microgravity environment affects how crystals and tissues develop, so it\u2019s a promising avenue for drug delivery, as well as tissue and organ growth. Space biotech is expected to be a huge market, and this company is differentiated from the competition because it has a stellar scientific team (particularly its chief science officer Daniela Bezdan).\n\nSteven Jacobs, partner at Lakestar\n\nZurich-based Lakestar invests in companies of all sizes: from early stage to growth. Its portfolio includes Isar Aerospace and ConstellR.\n\nD-Orbit\n\nFounded in 2011 in Italy, D-Orbit has grown to become the leading European in-space logistics company, offering launch and last-mile delivery service for satellite operators to reach their desired orbit. The team has a strong track record of many successful missions and is constantly innovating new services to address the growing need for in-space transport.\n\nClearSpace\n\nThis company, founded in Switzerland in 2018, is helping to fight the risk of increasing space junk by building a first-of-its-kind active debris removal service. In addition, the company is pioneering the development of close-proximity operations to perform critical in-orbit services such as life extension missions for satellite operators.\n\nMatteo Cascinari, partner at Primo Ventures\n\nPrimo Space Fund, launched in July 2020, is the first Italian VC fund specialising in spacetech.\n\nAdaptronic\n\nA very interesting Italian robotics startup founded by two young guys who make adaptive mechatronic devices that can grasp any object both on Earth and in space.\n\nzeroCO2\n\nAnother Italian startup, which uses satellite data to monitor climate conditions on Earth. For example, it can estimate carbon stocks of reforestation projects for companies in the carbon credit market.\n\nDBSpace\n\nFounded in 2011, this company develops e-pumps for liquid space propulsion \u2014 creating reusable engines for launch vehicles \u2014 and completes my hat trick of Italian startups. Also its \u201chardware-as-a-service\u201d business model is innovative and worth studying.\n\nSifted goes into orbit with our new spacetech report, which looks at the European companies powering the next several decades of earthly innovation.\n\n\u00c9anna Kelly is contributing editor at Sifted.

Some of our stories include affiliate links. If you buy something through one of these links, we may earn an affiliate commission. All prices are correct at the time of publishing.\n\nA few big names in the smart home space, iRobot and Shark in particular, have jumped on the robot-vacuum-and-mop bandwagon as of late. The two companies recently came out with their first 2-in-1 devices, and now you can pick up Shark's at its best price yet. The Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum and mop is 36 percent off at Amazon right now, bringing it down to $450, which is less than it was during the holiday shopping season last year. If you're an iRobot fan, the Combo j7+ is also on sale, but it's much more expensive at $899.\n\nShark Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum & Mop Shark's new 2-in-1 cleaning machine has improved suction power, sonic mopping capabilities and a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. $450 at Amazon\n\nIt's important to note that we at Engadget have not had the chance to test Shark's new machine yet, but we have had great experiences with all of the Shark robo-vacs we've tried to this point. Shark devices make appearances in both of our robot vacuum guides, with the standard AI Ultra vacuum taking one of the top spots on our list of overall favorites. The new 2-in-1 device seems to take a lot of notes from the standard model: you're getting a disk-like robot vacuum along with a bagless, self-emptying base into which the machine will dump the contents of its dustbin after every job.\n\nThe big difference here is the included water reservoir and the washable, reusable mopping pads that come with the 2-in-1 machine. It'll employ those when cleaning hardwood floors using a sonic mopping technique that supposedly scrubs floors up to 100 times per minute. If you have a mix of carpet, hardwood, tile and other flooring in your home, a 2-in-1 device like Shark's will make it more convenient to clean all of those surfaces in one go.\n\nIn addition to that new feature, this Shark robot vacuum has improved suction power, flexible silicon \"fins\" on its underside that help pick up more dirt and debris, obstacle avoidance and smart home mapping. Like most other robot vacuums, you can set cleaning schedules within Shark's companion app, which we think will be easy to use for both the tech-savvy and newbies alike. And we especially like that its base is bagless \u2014 that means you don't have to buy proprietary trash bags to fill it with like you do with some competitors.\n\nShark's device joins a number of other robo-vacs on sale right now. As we mentioned previously, iRobot's Combo j7+ is $200 off right now, plus you can get the Roomba s9+ for $200 off as well or the much more affordable Roomba 694 for only $179.\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",

            "text": "Is Boston Dynamics slowly preparing to put its bipedal robots to work?\n\nIn a glossy new video, the company has shown off its prototype Atlas robot tossing planks and tool bags around in a fake construction site. In a second, behind-the-scenes video, Boston Dynamics\u2019 team lead on Atlas, Scott Kuindersma, explained that the video is \u201cmeant to communicate an expansion of the research we\u2019re doing on Atlas.\u201d As ever, it\u2019s important to note that these videos are rigorously planned and structured, with falls and mistakes edited out. But, as Kuindersma notes, it\u2019s still a change of pace for Atlas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just thinking about how to make the robot move dynamically through its environment, like we did in Parkour and Dance,\u201d said Kuindersma. \u201cNow, we\u2019re starting to put Atlas to work and think about how the robot should be able to perceive and manipulate objects in its environment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a notable change in messaging from the Hyundai-owned company, which has never previously emphasized how its bipedal machines could be used in the workplace. Boston Dynamics only has two robots that it actually sells: Stretch and Spot. Stretch is a wheeled machine with a huge arm designed to move boxes in warehouses, while Spot is a four-legged robot mainly used to carry out surveillance and inspection tasks, acting as a remote CCTV camera or mapping construction sites and factories using 3D scanners.\n\nHowever, as Kuindersma explains in the behind-the-scenes video (above), a bipedal bimanual robot can do all sorts of tasks other robots can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe dream of humanoids is that they should be able to do all the things that we do, right?\u201d says Kuindersma. \u201cA humanoid robot will be well suited for applications like manufacturing, factory work, constructions \u2014 [places] where a humanoid form factor actually fits very well, with its bi-manual nature, its ability to stand upright, move heavy things around, and work in spaces that were traditionally designed for humans to do work in.\u201d\n\nSuch robots are not in common use anywhere in the world right now, mostly because their expensive and fragile nature means they\u2019re always worse value for money than human workers. But that dynamic may be slowly changing with improvements in hardware and software. Most notably, Elon Musk has thrown his hat into the robotics ring and is developing Optimus, a bipedal robot Musk claims will one day work in Tesla\u2019s factories. (Musk revealed a prototype of the robot late last year, and experts said that while the company had made speedy progress, it was very far from delivering a breakthrough.)\n\nIn a blog post, Atlas control lead Ben Stephens added that we\u2019re still a \u201clong way off\u201d from bipedal robots that can reliably work alongside humans. \u201cManipulation is a broad category, and we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cBut this gives a sneak peek at where the field is going. This is the future of robotics.\u201d",

            "text": "We\u2019ve seen the Atlas robot from Boston Dynamics dance, do backflips, and even perform parkour. But now it\u2019s received a new skill: the ability to pick up and throw objects.\n\nIn a new video(Opens in a new window), the Atlas robot is seen carrying a tool bag up some scaffolding and then throwing it to a human construction worker who's standing on a simulated construction site. The demonstration requires Atlas to use its sensors and a large variety of capabilities to navigate the site while remaining balanced.\n\nIn the video, the Atlas robot first picks up and places a large wooden plank to act as a bridge over the construction site. The machine then proceeds to walk over the plank after picking up the tool bag with its two hands.\n\nAtlas then spins and tosses the tool bag at the human construction worker\u2019s feet. After that, the machine pushes a wooden block out of its way, and ends the demonstration by performing a 540-degree flip to jump off the construction site.\n\nBoston Dynamics says the demo shows how Atlas could help human construction workers in practical ways. \u201cWe\u2019re layering on new capabilities,\u201d says(Opens in a new window) Atlas controls lead Ben Stephens. \u201cParkour and dancing were interesting examples of pretty extreme locomotion, and now we\u2019re trying to build upon that research to also do meaningful manipulation.\"\n\nOf course, the same video underscores how Atlas could one day replace human workers (or possibly lead a robot uprising against mankind).

As of press time, the launch was scheduled for Jan. 23.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the launch is a new technology designed to improve safety and reduce cost: NASA\u2019s Autonomous Flight Termination Unit, or NAFTU. The technology is critical for several reasons, not the least of which is that the Defense Department is requiring all space launches from U.S. facilities use autonomous termination systems by 2025, said David Pierce, director of NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on autonomous flight safety systems since around 2002, with the vision from the DoD that this would provide for increased access to space, responsive space, while also lowering the cost of launch operations,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe technology has been in development and tested on sounding rockets and expendable launch vehicles in a test capacity, he said. In conjunction with Kennedy Space Center, the Space Force and the Federal Aviation Administration, NASA developed NAFTU to pull in GPS data to determine if a vehicle is off course and then automatically terminate the flight if needed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been nothing short of a Herculean effort to get us to this point, which I view as a turning point in launch range operations \u2014 not just at Wallops, but across the United States,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe NAFTU system is going to enable launch companies, the venture class, smaller launch companies, to come [to] Wallops and be able to launch at an increased cadence, but also enable lower cost launch operations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe estimate that this could reduce launch range costs by as much as 30 percent at our range.\u201d\n\n\n\nNAFTU \u2014 which received FAA certification for the launch \u2014 is a generic software package that companies can customize for their systems, Pierce said. In Rocket Lab\u2019s case, they modified the platform into what they coined \u201cPegasus\u201d on the Electron rocket.\n\n\n\nRocket Lab has used automated termination technology on 20 of its New Zealand launches. It has resulted in a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in range costs and efforts, Beck said, describing it as \u201ca huge, huge game changer.\u201d\n\n\n\nEighteen different companies have expressed interest in acquiring NAFTU through NASA\u2019s technology transfer process, Pierce said.\n\n\n\nIn addition to being the first Electron launch in Virginia, the rocket will carry Virginia-based HawkEye 360\u2019s sixth cluster of three radio frequency surveillance satellites. \u201cThis is the first time HawkEye\u2019s flying with us, which is great to be able to fly them out of LC 2 here,\u201d Beck said.\n\n\n\nThe scheduled launch is the first of three Electron launches carrying HawkEye satellites. Rocket Lab will deliver 15 HawkEye satellites into low-Earth orbit within two years, according to a company press release.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to definitely expand our constellation capacity over the mid-latitudes in particular,\u201d said Adam Bennett, senior director of product marketing at HawkEye 360.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant enhancement for our customers, both domestically and globally, as we collect unique forms of radio frequency geospatial data and supply that to help solve a lot of critical mission needs around the globe,\u201d he added.\n\nTopics: Space, Space Operations, Robotics and Autonomous Systems",

Here is the list of the best 50 robot movies which you enjoy and can enjoy impossible imaginations of the mind, which can be a reality in the near future.\n\nCinema shows the imagination of the minds on the screen. There were various things that were shown in movies first and then invented later. Holograms and drones are some examples of that. Who doesn\u2019t even know Jarvis? I got inspired and developed my personal assistant in my college as a personal project although I am not attacking devils by using satellite-operated missiles, obviously.\n\nRobotic movies are always received well by people because such movies show a futuristic world and always broaden the boundary of human imagination. These movies may or may not have won awards, but they definitely won the heart of the public.\n\n1. RoboCop (1987)\n\nRoboCop is an American science fiction action film produced by Arne Schmidt. The movie moves around the concept of using cyborgs as a cop. When Alex Murphy, a cop, gets injured, the city is turmoiled by the crime, and the city is on the brink of collapse. Then, a private corporation wins the contract from the city government to privatize the police force in order to eradicate crime from the city.\n\nRoboCopThe story follows the journey of injured Murphy returning to the police force as a cyborg and eliminating the devils from the city but learning the wicked intentions of the company, he turned against them.\n\nDirector: Joshe Padilha\n\nJoshe Padilha Writers: Joshua Zetumer, Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner\n\nJoshua Zetumer, Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner Stars: Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton\n\n2. WALL-E\n\nWALL-E is an American animated science fiction film produced by Pixar Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film is set in the future when humans have left the earth and made colonies in space, and the entire earth is filled with trash, garbage, and cockroaches; we are talking about trash but does not involve humans, just my kindness, nothing else.\n\nWALL-E lives alone on the earth, lives in his small house, collects his related items from the garbage and watches TV at his home, and sees how humans lived on earth 700 years before.\n\nThe story follows the arrival of Eva, another robot sent by space humans to search for evidence of life on earth, and the meeting of these two robots and chaos around them following the love of Wall-e for Eva.\n\nThe film also shows the life of humans in space colonies where everything is done by robots which makes humans fluffier. The movie also commented on the final output of earth if our practices continue for the next some centuries.\n\nDirector: Andrew Stanton\n\nAndrew Stanton Writers: Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter\n\n3. Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)\n\nTerminator 2 is an American film released in 1991 and produced by James Cameron. James Cameron knows as an innovative filmmaker who never missed the opportunity to surprise the audience by pushing the boundaries with his novel filmmaking.\n\nThe movie starts by showing the struggle going on between humans and artificial intelligence(Skynet) in 2029. Skynet sends T-1000, an advanced terminator, to kill John at his young age, followed by John Conor sending a terminator T-800 to protect himself from T-1000.\n\nThe film goes back to 1995 Los Angeles, where young John, along with Sarah Conor, John\u2019s mother, and T-800, fight with Skynet and ultimately defeats them.\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nJames Cameron Writer: James Cameron, William Wisher\n\nJames Cameron, William Wisher Stars: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong\n\n4. Terminator (1984)\n\nTerminator is the first film of the terminator franchise, which was released in 1984 and produced by Gale Anne Herd.
