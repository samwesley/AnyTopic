The stretch along the North Branch of the Chicago River is the city\u2019s next corridor for growth. Brian Ernst/Sun-Times A few years ago \u2014 when Donald Trump was just a developer and \u201cslacking\u201d in the workplace was a fireable offense \u2014 the office building at 350 N. Orleans St. afforded a great perch from which to ponder the future of Chicago. Looking from west-facing windows of what used to be the Chicago Sun-Times\u2019 offices was like being on a cliff\u2019s edge of downtown skyscrapers, peering onto an urban valley. The hunkered-down buildings of Fulton Market, Chicago\u2019s old meat and produce district, were in immediate view, including a formidable cold-storage warehouse that later became the Chicago base for Google. As a speculative investment, the Google deal kicked off a development rush that in the past few years has made Fulton Market and the Near West Side the hottest growth area in Chicago. With the offices came restaurants and apartments. Blocks that Chicagoans used to regard as a Skid Row melded into the greater downtown. The private market made that happen, but City Hall egged it on with zoning changes that allowed bigger projects. As the city rolls into 2023, the picture changes. Chicago, while on the move, is still groggy from the pandemic, a civic episode of \u201clong COVID\u201d as measured by the persistence of hybrid work schedules and lagging use of public transit. The pandemic changed our relationship with urban life in ways we\u2019re still figuring out. But people still want to be and build here, so where will Chicago\u2019s next growth spurt be? There have been no official pronouncements, but the pattern is clear. Chicago\u2019s next batch of new high-rises will be north and northwest of downtown. Starting from West Town and running through Goose Island toward west Lincoln Park, the city\u2019s growth will radiate along the North Branch of the Chicago River, expanding what we think of as \u201cdowntown\u201d toward Wicker Park and Bucktown. It will happen because private investors have ordained it with the help of city policymakers. The biggest example is Lincoln Yards, developer Sterling Bay\u2019s decades-long plan to spend possibly $6 billion converting 53 acres of old industrial property into a live-work megalopolis. The first building, for life sciences research, is a few months from completion, and others will follow as demand dictates. It seems far off, but it\u2019ll start taking shape before you know it. What part of the Lincoln Yards site might look like one day, with buildings and public space along the North Branch of the Chicago River. Sterling Bay For a more near-term example, there\u2019s the city\u2019s decision in early May to replace the Chicago Tribune printing site with a Bally\u2019s casino, a $1.7 billion wager that could be placed once state licensing approval comes in. But that\u2019s hardly all that\u2019s going on in that north-northwest corridor. The casino deal has spun off other plans nearby. Developer Jeffrey Shapack, a major investor in Fulton Market, shifted a few blocks northward to grab several properties south of the Ohio Street feeder ramp. They would be almost next door to the casino site. Shapack got the city\u2019s OK in October for 2,200 residences and a boutique hotel on what had been a neglected nook with a Salvation Army center. Developer Onni Group reportedly is in line to buy part of the Tribune site that\u2019s north of Chicago Avenue. Whatever it builds there would be sandwiched between the casino and the south end of Goose Island, where Onni already has been approved for a five-tower project of homes and hotel rooms, potentially a $1.3 billion investment over 20 years, replacing a maintenance building for Greyhound buses. Onni Group has been approved for a five-tower project on the south end of Goose Island. Onni Group Turning east of the Brown Line, James Letchinger\u2019s JDL Development has 8 acres on the Near North Side that belonged to the Moody Bible Institute and were little used. He plans to bring Gold Coast-type density to the area west of Wells Street and mostly from north of Oak to Chestnut streets, adding perhaps 2,680 residences, although he was praised for how he worked with the community to repurpose old buildings and provide parks. Letchinger\u2019s city approvals came in 2021. If you get the idea these parts are heading \u201cuptown\u201d \u2014 upscale, in other words \u2014 you\u2019d be right. Developers are meeting requirements for affordable housing, mostly by incorporating them into market-rate projects, but this is an expansion of the city for the rich. It\u2019s what gets developers\u2019 hearts thumping. Perhaps 2,680 residences could be added on former Moody Bible Institute land on the Near North Side. Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture There\u2019s a danger this new-age gentrification will widen the divide in Chicago, with privileged areas getting resources and other neighborhoods being left behind, but the die is cast. \u201cIt\u2019s clear what developers want. We\u2019ve been seeing a desire to be near the river on the North Side,\u201d said Christina Harris, director of land use and planning for the Metropolitan Planning Council. She sees it as the high-end market taking care of things, while city officials try to be creative to draw attention elsewhere. The north-northwest passage is in demand because land is available, it\u2019s near the Loop and transportation nodes, and maybe most importantly, it\u2019s close to established and emerging wealthy neighborhoods. Building offices close to them offers a short commute, something the pandemic may have taught us to prize. The city has helped with riverfront improvements designed for beautification and public access. To balance things out, the city has mandated set-asides for affordable housing, which has created apartments for people who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford the area. The city encourages additional housing construction near transit lines and has expanded a program to unload vacant lots it owns on the South and West sides. Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s signature Invest South/West plan, a cagey marketing scheme that directs developer attention to commercial corridors ripe for improvement, has celebrated three groundbreakings. \u201cThe city is trying to be thoughtful in areas that don\u2019t typically see direct investment,\u201d Harris said. The road ahead is long and with lots of detours. Changes in the economy and in political priorities will affect the growth trajectory. But Chicago, for all its troubles, is pushing ahead, finding a way.

Dietz shared with us his take on the current state of the new-home market, what\u2019s holding back builders and what\u2019s needed to move forward. It\u2019s a complex problem without a simple solution, but easing regulations and training more skilled laborers to bring these developments to market could go a long way to help move the industry forward. Dietz said a number of actions can be taken to address the housing shortage, but he added that different solutions are needed to address the short-term versus long-term deficits. High interest rates and the lingering impact of high construction costs during the post-COVID housing boom are the primary causes of the short-term housing crunch, Dietz explained. \u201cThis inventory will ultimately be absorbed when the Fed eases monetary policy and mortgage rates fall back,\u201d he said. \u201cThis likely will occur on a sustainable basis in 2024.\u201d The structural housing shortage is more complex, and though a number of estimates exist on just how long-term the deficit is, Dietz and the NAHB economics teams estimate the nation is short about a million homes. \u201cThe primary reason for this long-term deficit is underbuilding between 2014 and 2019, particularly for single-family housing. And the deficit is most acute for entry-level housing appropriate for first-time and first-generation homebuyers,\u201d he said. The solution: addressing the supply-side issues at the root of the problem. \u201cI refer to these challenges as the 5 L\u2019s. It is lack of labor, land/lots, lumber/materials, lending for builders and land developers and ever-costly legal/regulatory costs,\u201d he said. In order to ease the housing shortage, which NAHB economists believe will take place between 2024 and 2030, officials need to \u201creduce, eliminate or reform costly land and housing construction rules, including inefficient zoning policies; recruit, train and retain skilled workers in residential construction; maintain access to credit for builders; and improve our building material supply-chain, including obtaining a new softwood lumber agreement with Canada,\u201d according to Dietz. No single-bullet solution exists, so making progress on closing the housing gap will require lawmakers to take action on a number of fronts, Dietz said. \u201cFor example, simply improving zoning rules for housing won\u2019t solve a local market\u2019s inventory challenges if the construction workers or developer financing is not available. And 2020 and 2021 showed what can happen to housing costs if there is not enough lumber to build new homes,\u201d he said. The challenges of building these days are particularly high for entry-level homes, largely because fixed costs, such as lot-development costs or fees, can make them financially unfeasible, according to Dietz. \u201cSo, as these regulatory costs increased after the Great Recession, the entry-level market was significantly reduced,\u201d he said, noting that in 1999, 37% of newly built single-family homes were under 1,800 square feet. That percentage dropped to 24% by 2021. \u201cBy count, the impact is even more striking. In 1999, there were 473,000 single-family homes built that were smaller than 1,800 square feet. In 2021, that number fell to just 236,000,\u201d Dietz explained. Eliminating exclusionary zoning rules, such as minimum lot sizes and setback requirements, would help relieve some of the pressure on builders, he said. \u201cLet the market determine lot size. Enable more town house construction for medium-density development,\u201d Dietz added. \u201cWith improvements in these areas, we should see additional entry-level construction during the 2024 through 2030 period.\u201d Having said that, Dietz noted that \u201cnot all regulations are bad.\u201d But they hinder the industry\u2019s ability to close the housing shortage gap. \u201cI think almost every housing economist, liberal or conservative, would agree that there are a lot of rules in place that harm housing affordability. Prior NAHB research has shown that about a quarter of a typical single-family home\u2019s sale price is due to regulatory costs, and in particular, land development costs.\u201d Dietz said about a third of the cost of building an apartment building in today\u2019s market is due to regulations. \u201cHarvard economist Ed Glaeser has argued that these kinds of costs are the largest impediment to the U.S. economy. Finding the right balance is a job for the political system, but I think it is clear that housing development is overly regulated and costly in most local markets. \u201cIf you care about the inventory crisis,\u201d he added, \u201cyou must make your voice heard on reducing regulatory costs associated with home building and land development. It\u2019s not just regulations and interest rates that are holding back the new-home construction business. About 400,000 construction industry jobs are unfilled. The biggest need is for carpenters and framers, according to Dietz. \u201cBut just about all the trades lack skilled individuals to fill jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 75% of homebuilders report a lack of framers, carpenters, plumbers, masons, concrete workers and electricians. These are in-demand jobs that pay above median wages.\u201d The industry needs to do a better job of recruiting and retaining these skilled laborers, he said. \u201cOrganizations like the Home Builders Institute are doing just that in many local markets. In fact, I estimate that due to a growing number of retirements, we need to bring on about 740,000 construction workers a year,\u201d he said. Dietz added that homebuilding and housing are both \u201csignificant and important parts of the U.S. economy\u201d and as of the third quarter of 2022, made up 16.1% of the gross-domestic product. Dietz added that residential fixed investment (RFI), which is a more cyclical home building and remodeling component, made up 4.3% of GDP. \u201cThe economic impact means housing is a significant job creator. In fact, for every single-family home built, enough economic activity is generated to sustain three full-time jobs for a year, per NAHB research. For every apartment, it is one job. And one job for every $100,000 in remodeling spending,\u201d he said.

That certainly holds true for new-construction communities, where a sales model can be the deciding factor in helping brokers and developers/builders close the deal. But whether it\u2019s for a downtown condo high-rise or a suburban single-family or town home community, a sales model needs to do much more than simply reflect popular design trends or showcase name-brand furniture and decor. As a commercial interior design firm with decades of experience working with builders and developers to market and successfully differentiate their product, we have a proven track record of creating sales models that resonate with buyers \u2014 even in the most challenging real estate landscape. In fact, it\u2019s more imperative to have strategically designed model homes in today\u2019s cooled-off real estate market than during the frenzied days of 2021 and early 2022 \u2014 when it wasn\u2019t unheard of for people to buy homes sight unseen. Now, a well-designed model can help compensate for higher interest rates by demonstrating to buyers how it will not only fit their post-pandemic lifestyle, but also help answer the question, \u201cHow can I live better?\u201d I\u2019ve always said good design should never be about spending the most money. This adage especially holds true today, when high interest rates, inflation and supply chain disruptions are driving up costs. As such, builders and brokers need to communicate value when presenting new-construction products \u2014 at any price point. This, however, should not come at the expense of pleasing, functional design. One way we\u2019re seeing this play out in our work with homebuilder and developer clients is a trend toward offering pre-selected design packages for finish choices \u2014 from cabinets and countertops to appliances and flooring \u2014 which streamlines costs by minimizing customizations and upgrades. Not only do we collaborate with our clients to curate these packages, but we also feature them in our sales models \u2014 demonstrating how the elements of the finish package work together, while also showing how they can be interpreted in a unique design for the space. Rather than displaying lots of extra bells and whistles that will ultimately inflate the cost of the home, the model should strike a balance between high design and attainability as it provides inspiration to the prospective buyer. Tribune Tower Residences Tribune Tower Residences Due to lifestyle changes coming out of the pandemic, today\u2019s homebuyers are demanding more from their homes, with a special emphasis on functionality. Likewise, with affordability top of mind for many, buyers are scrutinizing every square foot of space with an eye for how they can maximize it. That\u2019s making it especially important for sales models to demonstrate flexibility, adaptability and privacy across floor plans of all sizes. In designing sales models, we spend a great deal of time strategically showcasing a floor plan\u2019s multifunctionality to accommodate everything from family gathering areas and homework stations to dual workspaces and room for overnight guests \u2014 while also being mindful of privacy and noise. We\u2019re highlighting the functionality of features like pocket spaces and other nooks that have flexibility to pull double duty for multiple uses, and focusing on showing design \u201csolutions.\u201d One example of this is the five sales models our team created for the Tribune Tower Residences \u2014 the adaptive reuse of Chicago\u2019s landmark Tribune Tower from former newspaper offices to 162 luxury residences. We approached the models as an opportunity to spur sales by showing potential buyers how to get the most from the historic building\u2019s various floor plans. Buyers can step into each model and see not only aesthetically beautiful rooms, but also actionable ideas for making the spaces function best for their lifestyle \u2014 everything from how to display a TV or art collection to the best arrangement for hosting a dinner party or an overnight guest. Tribune Tower Residences opened in the midst of the pandemic, so flexibility and adaptability were top of mind. In one model, we added a contemporary-style sliding barn door to subdivide the condo\u2019s home library/office from the rest of the living space. In addition to demonstrating value and functionality, effective models are informed by what we know about the individuals who will ultimately inhabit the space. Our firm\u2019s design approach goes beyond potential buyers\u2019 demographics to also consider the end users\u2019 \u201cpsychographics\u201d \u2014 their values, attitudes, interests, lifestyles and aspirations. Models are a much more powerful sales tool when they present deliberate, specific and consistent psychographic choices that will help buyers envision themselves living there. Another example from Tribune Tower Residences is a model our team created based on psychographic insights that travel is a priority for many of the building\u2019s prospective buyers. Envisioning a hypothetical professional couple in their mid to late 40s who were avid travelers, our team designed the model with built-in display walls as an impactful way to showcase a collection of art and artifacts from around the world. The psychographic-informed design makes the home feel like it is inhabited by real, relatable people \u2014 and reflects an aspirational lifestyle that will resonate with prospective buyers. Even if a sales model presents buyers with a practical floor plan and an attractive value proposition, using psychographics to design a home can tap into the emotional aspect of homebuying to evoke a positive visceral feeling \u2014 that \u201caha! moment.\u201d The current market is driven by so many factors, from financial considerations to all the roles we ask our homes to fill \u2014 office, school, fitness center, gathering place, restful sanctuary and more. Given all we\u2019ve learned over the past three years of post-pandemic life, a successful model needs more than simple aesthetics, furnishing choices or the latest finish trends to resonate with buyers. To be the most effective sales tool, today\u2019s models must be thoughtfully designed with value, functionality and buyer psychographics in mind.
