Yeesh! Drivers crashed into Ainslie Art Plaza (again!) and Manor Greenway island ‚Äì Streetsblog Chicago
Update 1/2/23, 10:45 PM: After the publication of this piece, Ald.

We want to ensure that it‚Äôs designed in a way that leads to less collisions and a safer environment for our neighbors. The streetscape is envisioned to be completed by the end of 2024.

Driver struck Manor Greenway pedestrian island
Reportedly on New Year‚Äôs Eve, there was another infuriating act of driver destruction a mile west of the plaza on Lawrence Avenue (4800 N.) just west of the Chicago River. That‚Äôs where a (dunk?) motorist crashed into the crossing island at the north end of the Manor Avenue Greenway route (2930 W.) The island facilitates bike and pedestrian crossings between the greenway, a traffic-calmed itinerary on side streets, and the North Shore Channel Trail. The driver knocked down a warning sign and left debris all over the island.
