          "Gov. J.B. Pritzker should have held off on selling the Damen silos site along the Chicago River until the public weighed in on the location\u2019s future. Mark Capapas/Sun-Times file Illinois has an inadequate process for selling off land it no longer needs. It ought to do better. The glaring shortcoming was demonstrated when the state unloaded the so-called Damen Silos at 29th Street and Damen Avenue for $6.52 million to MAT Limited Partnership, which is owned by asphalt manufacturer Michael Tadin Jr. MAT has not endeared itself to many of the residents living near its asphalt plant in McKinley Park. Clearly, the 23-acre Damen property, which is right on the river, should have been part of a master plan focused on helping to redevelop the land along the Chicago River in a way most beneficial to city residents. Various groups around the city have said they want park space, a bike path or both on the site, opponents of the sale say. And transforming the river from an old-time industrial waterway to an environmental asset for the public has long been a goal for advocates of the river. But none of that was taken into account. The Illinois Department of Central Management Services said the state simply followed rules that said the land should be sold to the highest bidder. But Kate Eakin, president of the McKinley Park Development Council, told us the law requires only a sale at fair market value, and it does not apply if the state is selling the land to another government, such as the city of Chicago. At the very least, the state could have postponed the sale to give the city a chance to explore whether it wanted to take on the property. Opponents of the sale say the state closed its deal with MAT on Dec. 20 but didn\u2019t notify anyone until Dec. 23, when many city offices were closed either for the holidays or because of bad weather. That does not seem like the way a transparent government should operate. Generally, accepting the highest bid makes sense. We understand there is a risk to letting state politicians feel free to sell off property without insisting on the highest return to taxpayers. And community groups that have called for a voice in other various projects have not always had a realistic understanding about what can be achieved. But there are instances, such as in this case, in which the public benefit from a thoughtful reuse of the property would have been greater than simply getting some extra money tacked onto the sale price and having the property put back on the tax rolls. That\u2019s why better rules are needed. Illinois residents deserve to know what will be the ultimate use of land the state is selling, said Gerald W. Adelmann, president & CEO of Openlands. \u201cWe want to make sure the key stakeholders have opportunities before a sale to express their concerns,\u201d Adelmann said. As it stands now, the state does not require any plan for a site before selling it, other than making sure no state agencies want it. The Damen site, with its historic grain silos, is one of the last remaining large plots along the Chicago River that could be used for the public. The long-idle silos, which sit in a manufacturing district, evoke a time when Midwestern grain poured into the city and helped Chicago become the world\u2019s fastest-growing metropolis during the final decades of the 1800s. Neighbors fear any demolition of the silos might release pollutants, including asbestos, into the community. Done right, the site could be turned into a city jewel providing open space and recreation. But conservationists say no one, including the state, can produce the document in which the state notified the city of the pending sale. As it is now, the disposition process the state follows for situations like this is in obvious need of improvement. The state, which works on behalf of the public, has to get it right next time.

Plus, Chicago\u2019s next big growth spurt. Here\u2019s what you need to know today. Good afternoon! And happy new year! I watched 2023 roll in with my nephews, who went through multiple costume changes. One was dressed as Mario from \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d at one point, and the other was Spider-Man. Anyway, here\u2019s what you need to know today. Four-hour workdays, men curling their hair, people living to 300 and \u201cwatch-size radio telephones\u201d were among the 2023 predictions from some, uh, big thinkers from a hundred years ago. That\u2019s according to Paul Fairie, a researcher and instructor at the University of Calgary who combed through old newspaper clippings. Some of the predictions offer a window into what people were concerned about at the time, Fairie said. The foretelling of curly-haired men appears to come from \u201ca general worry about anything that challenges gender norms,\u201d he said. Among the other omens uncovered by Fairie was a \u201cPolar airline\u201d that made flying possible from Chicago to Hamburg via the North Pole. And another foresaw a future without beauty contests because \u201cthere will be so many beautiful people that it will be almost impossible to select winners.\u201d [NPR] The Illinois Supreme Court halted the abolition of the cash bail system on Saturday, just hours before a new law was slated to take effect, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. The end of cash bail is among the most controversial provisions in the SAFE-T Act, a sweeping package of criminal justice reforms. More than 60 counties in Illinois sued to stop the overhaul of the bail system, arguing the law was unconstitutional. A Kankakee County judge last week sided with them, writing that \u201cthe appropriateness of bail rests with the authority of the court and may not be determined by legislative fiat.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how long the temporary stay will remain in place and when the state\u2019s highest court will begin hearing arguments in the case. [Chicago Sun-Times] Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin remained in critical condition at a Cincinnati hospital after his heart stopped during a prime-time game against the Bengals on Monday. Hamlin, 24, collapsed after finishing a tackle, and his teammates immediately signaled to the sidelines for help. Medical staff appeared to give Hamlin CPR before he was taken off the field. In a statement, the Bills said Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest and his heartbeat was restored while on the field. [NPR] Hamlin\u2019s collapse is \u201ca reminder of the sport\u2019s inherent risk,\u201d reports The New York Times. Football \u201ccenters on players crashing into one another on every down, and no amount of dollars, training and good intentions will change that,\u201d the newspaper reports. \u201cThe best the N.F.L. can do is reduce risk, not eliminate it.\u201d [New York Times] More than 400 employees today began a three-day strike at Howard Brown Health, one of the most prominent health care providers serving the LGBTQ community in the Chicago area. The employees are protesting the organization\u2019s decision to lay off 61 union workers amid contract negotiations. Leaders of the new Howard Brown Health Workers United union say they were given assurances that union workers would not be laid off, and they have filed unfair labor charges with the National Labor Relations Board, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Howard Brown officials say the layoffs are part of a plan to close a $12 million budget hole while maintaining patient services. The jobs impacted include clinical therapists, facility management employees and retail workers who staff thrift stores that benefit the nonprofit organization. [Chicago Sun-Times] What we think of as \u201cdowntown\u201d may be expanding, crawling up the North Branch of the Chicago River and toward areas like Wicker Park and Bucktown, reports my colleague David Roeder at the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cThere have been no official pronouncements, but the pattern is clear. Chicago\u2019s next batch of new high-rises will be north and northwest of downtown,\u201d Roeder writes. Among the biggest is Lincoln Yards, a $6 billion plan to convert 53 acres of old industrial property into a \u201clive-work megalopolis,\u201d reports Roeder. And then there\u2019s the $1.7 billion plan to replace the Chicago Tribune printing site with a Bally\u2019s casino, a deal that\u2019s fueling nearby developments. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger this new-age gentrification will widen the divide in Chicago, with privileged areas getting resources and other neighborhoods being left behind, but the die is cast,\u201d Roeder reports. [Chicago Sun-Times] You know what, I\u2019m going to try and stay optimistic about this year. That might sound like a tall order considering the last three years \u2014 and how my job is doomscrolling the news for you five days a week. But not everything is bad. We\u2019ve got several cool-looking movies coming out this year, like John Wick: Chapter 4. Seriously, if you have not seen the John Wick movies, do yourself a favor and check them out. The entertainment team at the Los Angeles Times put together a list of 19 movies they are most looking forward to, and yes, John Wick made the cut. So did the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie, Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and the second installment of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wandering the sands of Dune. [LA Times] OK, I can\u2019t stop laughing about the 2023 predictions made by people in 1923. So I\u2019d like to know, what do you think will happen in 2123? I\u2019ll go first. Child actors will be replaced by Muppets, a long overdue correction if you ask me. Chicago will be the American metropolis. And, you can take this to the bank, people will look back at 2023 and wonder what we were thinking. Feel free to email me, and your response might be shared in the newsletter this week.",

          "There was a time when Carol Ross Barney could not have imagined winning the AIA Gold Medal. After all, \u201cmost of our work wouldn\u2019t even be called buildings,\u201d she says. Although her firm, founded in 1981, has a portfolio with plenty of buildings to its credit, much of the work she\u2019s most proud of\u2014transit stations, public parks, pedestrian streetscapes\u2014fits a broader definition of architecture. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as something that doesn\u2019t need to be designed,\u201d Ross Barney says. Last month, the American Institute of Architects awarded the 2023 AIA Gold Medal to Ross Barney, 73, making her the first living woman to win the award as an individual (Julia Morgan received the recognition decades after her death; Denise Scott Brown in 2016 and Angela Brooks in 2022 each won with their partners). Ross Barney is also the sixth Chicago architect to be awarded the medal\u2014but the first since Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe in 1960. record honored Ross Barney with a Women in Architecture Award as Design Leader in October. Carol Ross Barney. Photo \u00a9 Tara White Her firm\u2019s four decades of steadfast collaboration with public agencies has resulted in an outsize impact on Chicago\u2019s urbanism, especially as the social crises of recent years moved architectural discourse closer to her world. In 2020, the protests over the murder of George Floyd focused attention on the reality that public space is experienced, policed, and designed differently for different groups of people. And the Covid-19 pandemic pushed people outside, often into a reinvented, ad hoc public space. For Ross Barney, the professional ethos of this moment is simple: design excellence for all is a right, not a privilege. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve always absolutely adored about doing public work is that it lets me keep my hat on as an \u2018owner,\u2019\u2005\u201d she says. \u201cYes, I\u2019m their architect, but I\u2019m also a citizen.\u201d \u201cIf ever there was a time, it\u2019s now for Carol,\u201d says Patricia Saldana Natke, founder of Chicago-based UrbanWorks. \u201cHer designs embody hope, tackling complex social, spatial, and cultural challenges by creating urban connectivity. Her determination to consider many voices in her architecture is remarkable and worthy of emulation.\u201d Ross Barney\u2019s firm is located in Harry Weese\u2019s former studio space, and, in the pantheon of Chicago architects, his work on Washington, D.C.\u2019s subway stations\u2014with their Brutalist material palette and grand vaults\u2014is a particular inspiration for her. Ross Barney\u2019s own transit projects for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) have applied similar levels of material and formal coherence. At the open and airy Cermak\u2013McCormick Place CTA Station, a perforated steel scrim shelters commuters from harsh winter winds while still offering views outward to the city. Across town at the Morgan Street CTA Station, a pair of glass-clad steel frames pay homage to the archetypal Chicago structural system. Perhaps Ross Barney\u2019s crowning achievement has been the Chicago Riverwalk, which reshaped the edge of the Chicago River into one of the city\u2019s most treasured civic assets. Designed as a series of outdoor rooms, Ross Barney (who partnered with the landscape architecture firm Sasaki on the project) delivered a terraced amphitheater, a kayak launch, a floating fish habitat, and more\u2014bringing life and activity back to 1\u00bc miles of riverfront. This kind of public impact doesn\u2019t happen without advocacy, pushing Ross Barney beyond the drafting table. The Riverwalk required an act of Congress to build; as a result of her lobbying efforts, 30 feet of public space is required for any new development along the Chicago River, ensuring that future building continues this ribbon of open space. Despite the challenges that remain for women in the profession, Ross Barney says that her gender has sometimes been an advantage because \u201cthe same things aren\u2019t expected of you.\u201d While many men were pushed toward high-profile commercial work, women were often left with public projects, she says, that were perceived as less important. But this work came with the opportunity to have a much greater impact on the public realm. \u201cAs a citizen designer,\u201d she has said, \u201cI feel empowered to fight for the ideas my people believe in and the quality they deserve.\u201d  Zach Mortice is a Chicago-based design journalist who focuses on landscape architecture and architecture.
