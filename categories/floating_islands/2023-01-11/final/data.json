            "text": "Temtem Update 1.2.1 has received a fresh update. Below, you can find a complete list of the game update's enhancements, bug fixes, and patch notes. Temtem Update 1.2.1 is now available for download for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series S/X, and PC on all platforms. The platform may have an impact on the file size.\n\nTemtem Patch Notes\n\nNew Stuff\n\nWe have added chat to battles . You\u2019ll see a new menu during battles from now on, with new icons for the Details, Battle Log, and the Chat with their assigned hotkey. Chat will be hidden by default, and you can make it pop out by pressing the associated hotkey, just how the Battle Log works. Chat in battle is disabled for Ranked matches, in-game tournaments, and Dojo Wars, and available for friendly competitive matches and PvE.\n\nWe\u2019ve added the new music variations per island, this time to the competitive battle theme .\n\nThe Egg Technique icon now appears in Techniques that are Egg Techs in the details of a Tem in Showdown.\n\nWe\u2019ve implemented a new icon that will notify you if there is something available to claim in events.\n\nImprovements in TemTem Patch 1.2.1\n\nWe have tweaked the idle battle cameras following the feedback provided by the community: In order to reduce motion sickness in some players, we\u2019ve slowed all camera movement to 1/3 of its original movement speed. They will also start after 12 seconds of inactivity, as opposed to the previous 5 seconds of threshold. This will make them way less prevalent. In the specific case of Koish fishing, we\u2019ve removed most of the camera angles so that only cameras that focus on the Koish patterns appear. We have also developed some new cameras for this activity in particular that will make identifying the patterns and colors easier. We know idle cameras have caused issues to some our players. Before we go through with disabling them, which would imply we stop receiving feedback and iterating on the feature, we\u2019d like to give these changes a go to improve the main problems the cameras had. We believe the idle cameras add variety and richness to the game, so we\u2019d rather polish them until everyone is happy than disable them without giving them a chance to be good.\n\nWe have added some performance improvements to the Switch version. These improvements will be a huge help with the current crashes that the console is experiencing. But we\u2019re not done yet, and we will be adding even more performance improvements for it in future patches.\n\nMore Improvements\n\nTem Renaming Voucher is no longer automatically used when renaming a Temtem. Players will now always have the option to pay the name change with Pansuns instead.\n\nPlayers now have the ability to use the Fruit Blender with Tems in the Temdeck too, not only the ones in the squad.\n\nThe Fruit Blender now shows how the stats will change with regards to the TVs selected.\n\nShowdown Temtem will now always start with their SV value at 50 by default, instead of 1.\n\nWe have added rarity indicators to customization items, like emotes, loading screens, battle intros, battle outros and battle outro music.\n\nThe game will now show the gamepad buttons for each action when you press a modifier (a button that displays a set of hotkeys) in battle.\n\nWe\u2019ve added new notifications for the Trade House: when you sell something, and when an auction ends without the item/Tem selling.\n\nWhen you input a maximum quantity in one of the advanced options of the Temdeck and Trade House filters, it will now automatically select 0 as the minimum quantity.\n\nAdded more information to the Victory screen at the end of a Ranked match in the case of winning because the opponent concedes or in the case of tying.\n\nAdded a glowing effect to the claimable items of events, the same effect that is used in the Tamer Pass.\n\nWe\u2019ve made some improvements to entering text in some UIs, so it\u2019s easier to understand if the text is not valid for any reason.\n\nWe\u2019ve made some performance improvements to the game\u2019s UI.\n\nBalance\n\nPvE\n\nDojo Rematches and Archtamers teams have been revisited and modified to match the current meta.\n\nTemtem\n\n#009 \u2013 Platimous SPD has been reduced 82 \u21d2 78.\n\n\n\n#088 \u2013 Umishi Water Blade has been removed from its move pool. Now learns Aqua Bullet Hell at level 5.\n\n\n\n#089 \u2013 Ukama Water Blade has been removed from its move pool.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes Patch Notes\n\nAll platforms\n\nFixed a softlock when a player captures a Temtem and sends it to the squad while being in Co-op.\n\nFixed a softlock after skipping the final dialogue with the Stowaway at the mines during the main quest at Tucma.\n\nFixed several bugs involving the prison part of the Tucma main quest in Co-op.\n\nFixed getting stuck between Lyato and Ige after battling them.\n\nFixed players being demoted in ranked even if they\u2019d won the last match.\n\nFixed that starter Temtem and Anahir were not correctly counting for the Kudos about capturing all Tems in game.\n\nFixed that ranked wins while unraked were counting towards the OP Kudo.\n\nFixed players were getting the I\u2019m in Danger Kudo automatically the first time they opened the game.\n\nFixed being able to move while having a tutorial on-screen when entering a building.\n\nFixed a case where idle battle cameras were being reproduced in the Swap menu during a battle.\n\nFixed the titles of this year\u2019s first in-game tournament winners. It will now accurately represent the year of the tournament.\n\nFixed Hopeless Tonic\u2019s Doom status condition not lasting 4 turns as it was stated in patch 0.7.3.\n\nFixed that Gyalis could learn the technique Footwork twice.\n\nFixed seeing a placeholder lock number in the Battle Log in a match against NPCs.\n\nFixed that triggering an NPC battle at the Arissolan Dojo in Co-op while the Co-op partner is mid-air would make the partner fly to the player\u2019s position.\n\nFixed that the Events menu was not automatically activating if the game was open when the event started.\n\nFixed the page indicator of the Events menu that was not working correctly.\n\nFixed that Egg Techniques were not displaying the Egg Technique icon in the details of Showdown Temtem.\n\nMore Platforms on All Fixes\n\nFixed Tempedia \u201cSort by name\u201d setting was not working correctly at the Tempedia Showdown menu.\n\nFixed the incorrect finishing date of the Winterfest event.\n\nFixed that the disappearing effect of the Winterfest trees prop would sometimes spawn without texture.\n\nFixed completing the \u201cTaking a Photo\u201d Tamer Pass weekly challenge was completing the event quest of the same name.\n\nFixed that the player character wouldn\u2019t swap into the Incognito Hood automatically while doing the main quest at Quetzal if the player had a cosmetic set equipped.\n\nFixed the Beauty Center\u2019s door appearing in red even if the player could already enter the building.\n\nFixed an awkward camera angle happening at the end of some techniques like Oshi-Dashi or Hook Kick.\n\nFixed that conceding in any main story battles while an idle battle camera was moving resulted in a weird camera angle at the end of the battle.\n\nDev team has fixed the problem, where Local, Global and Trade chat channels would fail to translate their name labels into any language.\n\nFixed that dismissing a Temtem from a Showdown squad would leave invisible empty slots in the squad.\n\nFixed that players\u2019 equipped cosmetic sets would change color when hovering over a top or bottom cosmetic in the Customization menu.\n\nFixed the icon of the Siege Engine Carrier mount.\n\nFixed that some exterior housing items were not showing the rarity in the item portrait.\n\nFixed that some interior housing items were not showing the rarity in the item portrait under specific circumstances.\n\nFixed Neoedo\u2019s teleport sounds attenuating the instance music.\n\nThere\u2019s a fix on seals that would not have sound in Preview windows of the Temtem\u2019s details. This bug would occur when you equip them before playing its SFX in the preview of the Backpack\n\nFixed the offset of some icons inside text.\n\nPC and PS5\n\nFixed some buttons of the Showdown UI that were not working when pressing them with the mouse.\n\nTemtem Wiki\n\nTemtem is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game produced by Humble Bundle and created by the Spanish production team Crema. Early access to the game was made available on Steam on January 21, 2020, and PlayStation 5 on December 8, 2020. On September 6, 2022, the full version of the game would also be made available, along with versions for the Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S. The creature-collection video game, which makes use of the Unity production engine, was heavily influenced by Nintendo's Pok\u00e9mon franchise. Between May and June 2018, the crowdfunding website Kickstarter helped to partially finance the game.\n\nTemtem Gameplay\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon video game franchise has a big influence on Temtem's gameplay. As they explore the area, players capture the titular Temtem creatures and control them in duels with other Temtem that are being commanded by either an NPC or another player. Like double bouts in the Pok\u00e9mon series, all Temtem battles take place in a 2x2 arena. In the game, players take on the role of a beginner Temtem tamer who begins their trip through the six floating islands of the Airborne Archipelago while contending with the danger of Clan Belsoto, a villainous group that intends to forcibly annex the islands.\n\nDisclaimer: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
