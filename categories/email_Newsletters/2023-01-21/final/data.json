Check out more newsletters\n\nSince Jimmy Butler fell into Kevin Durant\u2019s knee on Jan. 8 and left him with a sprained MCL for the second straight season, the Nets have said they are confident they can handle his absence better than they did last year.\n\nThe early results have not exactly backed up that faith, but one of the key reasons why the Nets may be in a better spot to survive a Durant-less stretch overall? The team\u2019s double-double leader.\n\nNic Claxton has elevated his game at the rim on both ends of the floor, making a run at history on the offensive end and becoming an elite rim protector on the defensive end, all at the age of 23.\n\n\u201cI think overall just his aggressiveness [has been his biggest improvement],\u201d Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said recently. \u201cI think you see it on both ends of the floor, whether it\u2019s putback dunks, whether that\u2019s playing above the rim, whether that\u2019s an element now of catching the half-roll and being able to be a passer or a finisher. So the offensive end, that\u2019s probably the most growth we\u2019ve seen from him, and then defensively just being at every spot for us on the defensive end of the floor. I think he\u2019s really taken pride in being a defensive player and the impact that it has on our team, on the game, a lot of times on the outcome, really. I think he\u2019s taken some ownership of that, which has been huge.\u201d\n\nAfter an 8-for-9, 20-point effort in Friday night\u2019s skid-ending road win over the Jazz, Claxton is shooting a league-leading 73.4 percent from the field, which trails only the Knicks\u2019 Mitchell Robinson (74.19 percent, in the abbreviated 2019-2020 season) for the highest single-season field-goal percentage in NBA history.\n\nWith looks like these, Nets center Nic Claxton is challenging the single-season record for field-goal percentage. Robert Sabo\n\nAfter shooting a combined 64.6 percent from the field during his first three seasons in the NBA, the 6-foot-11 Claxton added some muscle during the most recent offseason and has used it to his advantage in setting up shop in the paint.\n\nJust how much? Here\u2019s a breakdown of where Claxton is getting taking his shot attempts this season, according to NBA.com:\n\nRestricted area: 204-for-252 (81 percent)\n\nIn the paint, non-restricted area: 27-for-58 (46.4 percent)\n\nMid-range: 1-for-4 (25 percent)\n\nCorner 3: 0-for-2\n\nClaxton\u2019s 81 percent shooting from the restricted area is the best in the league among players averaging more than five attempts per game. Lakers star Anthony Davis ranks second at 78.7 percent.\n\nNic Claxton\u2019s 2022-23 season shot chart via Basketball Reference\n\nThe refined shot selection has Claxton\u2019s average shot distance at 2.5 feet, per Basketball Reference, which is tied for the shortest mark of his career and good for seventh in the NBA (Robinson has the league\u2019s shortest distance at 1.2 feet and Knicks teammate Jericho Sims is second at 2.0). Claxton\u2019s arsenal during his first two seasons in the NBA included the occasional 3-pointer as he tried to carry over some versatility from college. But over the past two seasons, he has attempted just two 3-pointers and instead honed in on his bread and butter: the 2-pointer, a shot on which he leads the league with a 73.9 field-goal percentage.\n\nHere\u2019s how Claxton\u2019s shot type breaks down this season:\n\nAlley-oops: 33-for-41 (80.5 percent)\n\nDunks: 109-for-115 (94.8 percent)\n\nFinger rolls: 5-for-8 (62.5 percent)\n\nHook shots: 24-for-48 (50 percent)\n\nLayups: 93-for-137 (67.9 percent)\n\nBank shots: 7-for-9 (77.8 percent)\n\nFadeaways: 1-for-3 (33.3 percent)\n\nTip shots: 23-for-29 (79.3 percent)\n\nAfter figuring out how best to play and produce in the same lineup as Durant and Kyrie Irving, Claxton is now benefiting from their presence. Of his 173 assisted field goals, 47 have come from Durant and 36 from Irving.\n\nThe result is Claxton averaging a career-high 12.4 points per game, a number that would be even higher if not for his glaring remaining weakness: free-throw shooting. He is shooting a career-low 47.1 percent from the charity stripe, which came back to hurt the Nets on Thursday night when Claxton missed two costly free throws late (one on purpose) in a loss to the Suns. He went 4-for-8 from the line on Friday night.\n\nNic Claxton tries to finish in the lane between two Spurs defenders on Jan. 17. USA TODAY Sports\n\nBut Claxton\u2019s strides this season are not limited to one end of the floor. He has said he believes he should be in contention for Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nClaxton\u2019s credentials for the award begin with his league-leading 2.7 blocks per game (the Bucks\u2019 Brook Lopez is next with 2.5 per game). Claxton averaged just 1.1 blocks per game across his first three seasons, but has become a swatter extraordinaire at the rim in Year 4.\n\n\u201cJust physically, he\u2019s much more imposing than when he first came in,\u201d Joe Harris said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot more confidence. The stuff that he does defensively for us right now is probably the biggest leap. Offensively, he\u2019s always been very skilled and capable of doing a lot of different things. But defensively, he\u2019s been elite for us in terms of protecting the rim.\u201d\n\nWith four more blocks on Friday night, Claxton extended his streak of having blocked at least three shots to 11 straight games, the second-longest streak in franchise history behind Shawn Bradley.\n\nNic Claxton rises for a block against the Suns\u2019 Dario Saric on Jan. 19. NBAE via Getty Images\n\nClaxton also has helped the Nets in being able to guard multiple positions, going from defending the rim to defending the perimeter on any given possession.\n\nNow, Claxton will be tasked with keeping his game at a high level \u2014 and perhaps even elevating it \u2014 during Durant\u2019s absence to help keep the Nets afloat. But given the improvements he has made this season, the test might be coming at the right time for the former second-round pick.\n\n\u201cJust me getting stronger and my body being able to adapt to the physicality of the game [has been key],\u201d Claxton said recently. \u201cJust being available and opportunity, just consistent experience is the best teacher.\u201d\n\nMissing the points\n\nHow does a team fill the void when they are missing a scorer who averaged 29.7 points per game?\n\nThe Nets want to do so by shooting more 3-pointers, as in 10 to 15 more than the 31.3 per game they are currently averaging.\n\nJoe Harris is shooting under 40 percent on 3-pointers for the first time since the 2016-17 season. NBAE via Getty Images\n\nIt would help, then, if the shooter who entered the season as the team\u2019s best 3-point threat over the past few years could return to form.\n\nBefore having to undergo a pair of surgeries on his ankle last season, Harris was a 45 percent shooter from beyond the arc from 2017-2022. During that span, he twice led the NBA in 3-point shooting: in 2018-19 (47.4 percent) and 2020-21 (47.5 percent).\n\nThis season, though, Harris is shooting only 39 percent from 3 \u2014 still above league-average but well below the standard he has set for himself.\n\nHarris re-entered the starting lineup after Durant went down because of the MCL sprain, which the Nets are hoping might get Harris in a better rhythm with an increase in minutes. That appeared to be the case Thursday against the Suns, when he shot 4-for-4 from downtown in 31:35 (the line was 3-of-6 in 21:27 against the Jazz).\n\nSeth Curry also could help shoulder some of the 3-point load. He is shooting 41.7 percent from deep. In the five games since Durant went down, Curry is averaging 15.2 points.",

But wait, a solution is coming soon.\n\nChico announced it will be implementing pay-by-plate parking kiosks for downtown metered parking spaces through February opening the opportunity for drivers to both pay by credit card and pay by online app.\n\nChico traffic engineer Wyatt West said coin-only meters will still be working, but the new system will allow drivers to pay online by entering their license plate number.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re transitioning to a pay-by-plate technology meaning you put in your plate and you pay for your parking,\u201d West said. \u201cYou actually don\u2019t have a ticket; you don\u2019t have to go back to your vehicle. You just pay your parking, and you go on about your business.\u201d\n\nWest said their system will also allow people to use their smartphone to pay for their parking and add minutes to their spot from wherever they are.\n\nFor example, if one was busy drinking coffee in a store and needed to add time to their meter, they may do so through the app.\n\n\u201cIf you want to add time later, you can remotely. It\u2019s a huge benefit. People won\u2019t have to use these kiosks as much as they think they have to. If you\u2019re having a lunch at the Banshee or whatnot, You can pay just add time to your meter,\u201d West said.\n\nWest said the current meters that accept credit card payments have reached their technology\u2019s end of life and were scheduled to be replaced in December, but installation was delayed because of weather.\n\nThe city paused all enforcement of parking meters because many of the old meters were reported to have issues with taking payments.\n\nWest said the city will be replacing these meters with the kiosks and will replace the existing downtown Transit Center parking kiosk with two new kiosks.\n\nIn addition to the new way to pay online, West said the new parking system will allow business owners to pay for their customers\u2019 parking.\n\nParking fees will be the same as the old meters. From First and Fifth streets to Salem and Wall streets it will be $1 per hour and parking spaces around the downtown core will be $0.50 per hour.\n\nWest said the new system is expected to be implemented by the end of February.\n\nThe city said in a press release Thursday, \u201cEnforcement of the downtown core will be on hold until the new system is fully installed and operational\u201d \u2014 which means until the new meters are working, parking is free downtown.",

Mahan was officially sworn into office in a private ceremony Dec. 29, 2022 and assumed his duties at midnight New Year\u2019s Day, stepping immediately into one of the worst series of rainstorms San Jose had seen in six years.\n\nThis 6 p.m. event at the Center for the Performing Arts in downtown San Jose is a public celebration, which \u2014 if he follows his predecessors\u2019 tradition \u2014 will include performances by local artists and acknowledgement of other elected officials.\n\nFormer Mayor Sam Liccardo held his first inauguration in the same 2,000-seat venue in January 2015, where he unveiled his \u201cWe Are San Jose\u201d slogan between an opening Aztec dance performance and a closing Buddhist invocation. Mayor Chuck Reed, in line with his less flashy nature, opted for a much briefer morning ceremony at the San Jose City Hall Rotunda in January 2007 before an audience of about 900 people, including some seated outside the rotunda or in overflow rooms at City Hall.\n\nThe inauguration, which will be followed by a reception with food and drinks, is open to the public, but RSVPs are requested because of limited seating.

Layoffs will take longer in other countries due to local laws, Pichai said.\n\nThe job cuts represent about 6% of Google's global workforce. It is not clear how many of those jobs are in the U.S.\n\nJanuary has been a brutal month for Big Tech workers. Microsoft announced sweeping layoffs Thursday and is cutting 10,000 jobs, or about 5% of its workforce. Amazon and Salesforce announced layoffs earlier this month.\n\nSign up for daily news! Stay informed with WPR's email newsletter.\n\nThe companies say they hired rapidly during the pandemic and now have to make serious cuts amid an uncertain economy.\n\n\"Over the past two years we've seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today,\" wrote Pichai in the email to staff posted online and in a regulatory filing.\n\nThe layoffs also come as major tech companies like Google pivot to artificial intelligence. But expanding on early investments comes with \"tough choices,\" Pichai wrote.\n\nThe job cuts will hit employees throughout parent company Alphabet and across \"product areas, functions, levels and regions,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to cuts at big tech companies, there have been layoffs on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs said it was planning to lay off about 3,200 employees in one of the biggest cuts since the 2008 financial crisis.",

            "text": "We are truly living in the golden age of the email newsletter. People are writing about just about every topic you can imagine, including many subjects related to business. These publications can be great ways to keep up with business trends and get insight on how to be a successful entrepreneur. But with seemingly endless options out there, how do you decide which newsletters are worth your time?\n\nWe can help. Below, we highlight our favorite lesser-known business newsletters that deliver high-quality content in their niches, such as marketing strategies and tax advice. You won\u2019t find a few well-known offerings on our list, like Morning Brew and The Hustle. While those are great options for people who only have a few minutes to quickly skim the top headlines of the day, they are generalist publications and not geared toward people who are managing or building businesses.\n\nSmall business owners are more likely to benefit from subscribing to daily or weekly (or even monthly) newsletters that are more geared to the everyday entrepreneur, not Fortune 500 CEOs. Improve your business smarts in 2023 by adding these publications to your inbox.\n\n1. The Marketing Millennials\n\nThis marketing-focused newsletter by Daniel Murray is part of the Workweek content collective. Marketing Millennials includes \u201czero BS\u201d and \u201cunfiltered\u201d conversations with thought leaders in the marketing industry. Topics of conversation include building profitable newsletter businesses and creating effective TikTok videos. We like that Daniel focuses on storytelling with his guests and generating actionable insights that business owners can apply to their own marketing efforts.\n\n2. Social Media Today\n\nLearning how to create social media campaigns is an essential skill for small business owners that want to advertise at little or no cost. Social media is also a fast-changing landscape, which is where Social Media Today comes in. This publication follows trends and developments in social media, with a daily newsletter that contains helpful articles on social media marketing, platform updates, posting strategies, influencer marketing and more. Social Media Today is part of the Industry Dive family of publications, which offers free newsletters on business niches from groceries to waste management.\n\nTip: Some business newsletters have corresponding podcasts. Check out our favorite business podcasts for listening recommendations.\n\n3. b. Newsletter\n\nMaybe we\u2019re a little biased on this one, but we think every business owner should add b. to their newsletter list. Twice a week, subscribers receive actionable business tips and insightful interviews with industry leaders. You\u2019ll hear how CEOs and founders made it big, as well as learn from experts how to solve common business problems, such as building your company or improving your office culture. Business.com\u2019s b. newsletter also adds a bit of entertainment into the mix with an original comic, cocktail recommendations and analysis of business lessons from movies and TV shows. Who said reading about business can\u2019t be fun?\n\n4. Big Ideas for Small Business\n\nWhile many newsletters focus on big-picture topics such as business strategy and branding, Barbara Weltman drills down into a valuable niche: saving you money on taxes. The Big Ideas for Small Business newsletter comes out monthly, with articles such as \u201cWriting Off Casualty or Disaster Losses for Your Business\u201d and \u201cReward and Punishment on Your Tax Return for Being a Pass-through Owner.\u201d This content might not be as trendy as other publications, but we highly recommend Weltman\u2019s newsletter as a resource for small business owners who need to navigate the complex U.S. tax system. Plus, Weltman has a daily send \u2014 called the Idea of the Day \u2014 that gives a succinct paragraph or two on a need-to-know business topic.\n\n5. Growth Unhinged\n\nThis weekly newsletter is brought to you by Kyle Poyar, an operating partner at venture capitalist firm OpenView. Poyar\u2019s day job involves helping his firm\u2019s portfolio companies grow, and Growth Unhinged provides a free look at his methods. The newsletter explores the \u201cplaybooks behind the fastest growing startups\u201d with in-depth case studies. As the name implies, Growth Unhinged focuses on expanding businesses through \u201cproduct-led growth (PLG), pricing, go-to-market strategy\u201d and more. We\u2019re particularly fond of Poyar\u2019s use of drawings, GIFs and emojis to demonstrate his points.\n\n6. Kevan Lee\n\nKevan Lee, the person, is a vice president of marketing at Oyster who also teaches marketing at Boise State University. In his self-titled weekly newsletter, Kevan takes readers inside the world of startup marketing and brand-building with weekly playbooks, case studies, interviews and trends. We find Kevan Lee, the newsletter, to be on the technical side of things, which is great for anyone looking to get a real-world education in marketing. A paid version of the publication also includes Kevan\u2019s playbooks, channel strategies and other tools. Like with Poyer\u2019s Growth Unhinged, Lee also uses appealing imagery to make his newsletter more digestible.\n\n7. Bootstrapped Founder\n\nBootstrapped Founder is about starting and growing a small business, even when you\u2019re working a full-time job. This newsletter is written by Arvid Kahl, the author of Zero to Sold and founder of FeedbackPanda. Kahl particularly focuses on building and monetizing audiences, as well as the idea of \u201cbuilding in public\u201d to burnish your own reputation as an expert. We like that the Bootstrapped Founder provides useful tips for entrepreneurs who are trying to make their entrepreneurial dreams work without deep pockets or extensive funding.\n\n8. Intercom Newsletter\n\nThis weekly newsletter is an in-house publication produced by customer service software company Intercom. Subscribers to this free resource receive guides on \u201cproduct management, sales and marketing, customer support, and startups.\u201d We like that many of Intercom\u2019s articles clearly define the topic (such as email marketing) and provide step-by-step instructions on how to get started in that area and measure your success. [See our picks for the best email marketing services.]\n\nKey takeaway: While newsletters are great for getting fresh business tips quickly, there are a number of timeless books that can help improve your business skills too.\n\n9. Five Things Worth Sharing\n\nThis newsletter is from Amy Guth, a podcast host for Crain\u2019s Chicago Business and a radio host for WGN. As the name suggests, each edition consists of five items worth sharing. While these typically focus on \u201cmedia and culture subjects,\u201d many of the stories revolve around offbeat business topics. For example, one recent issue delved into \u201cmasculine defaults in the workplace\u201d and \u201cthe possible link between vampires in pop culture and economic uncertainty.\u201d This is definitely a unique newsletter that, despite being a quick read, is likely to provoke interesting thoughts. There\u2019s a reason Guth sums up her archive as \u201cJust Everything, Okay?\u201d\n\n10. SatPost\n\nTrung Phan writes the SatPost (a portmanteau of \u201cSaturday\u201d and \u201csh*tpost\u201d), a roundup of the week\u2019s best memes and tweets. Phan, who gained fame on Twitter for his witty and engaging threads, is known for breaking down fascinating business stories into bite-sized pieces. We find his newsletter incredibly readable \u2014 much like his Tweets \u2014 and, dare we say, completely addictive. Topics include \u201cWhy is LinkedIn so cringe?\u201d and \u201cMrBeast\u2019s $1.5B YouTube empire.\u201d Subscribe and learn something new in a well-written, appealing format.\n\n11. Not Boring\n\nA business newsletter that calls itself \u201cnot boring\u201d certainly sounds promising, and author Packy McCormick definitely delivers on his promise. The publication covers emerging business trends and strategies, with a particular focus on cutting-edge technologies. A few topics covered in Not Boring include Web3, carbon removal, nanotechnology and generative AI. The newsletter goes out two days a week, with one send focused on long-form essays and the other consisting of sponsored or guest posts. [Learn how to reduce your business\u2019s carbon footprint.]\n\n12. Young Money\n\nThis up-and-coming newsletter is written by Jack Raines, a Columbia Business School student who quit his first job because, in his words, \u201clooking at spreadsheets for eight hours a day got boring.\u201d Today, Raines spends his free time backpacking around the world and writing. Much like the author\u2019s life, Young Money hops around from topic to topic, but with a focus on financial advice and motivation. We enjoy Jack\u2019s engaging writing style and unique perspective on current events.\n\nThe first quarter of the year is a great time to declutter your inbox and narrow your reading list to the newsletters that really impact your life. What emails can you junk and which are must-reads as you focus on your entrepreneurial pursuits? Consider which of our favorite newsletters highlighted above best matches your needs in this season of business and join the mailing list. It also can\u2019t hurt to subscribe to all 12 to start and see which you like the most after a few weeks. Like in business, a trial-and-error method can pay dividends.",

            "text": "Cardinal News is the only news organization west of Richmond with a full-time reporter in the state capital year-round. Keep up with our General Assembly coverage by signing up for our free daily email newsletter and our new weekly political newsletter, West of the Capital.\n\nRICHMOND \u2013 A Senate panel on Friday rejected three Republican proposals seeking to limit access to abortion in Virginia, one of Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s legislative priorities for this year after the U.S. Supreme Court in a historic decision last June returned the authority over women\u2019s reproductive rights back to the states.\n\nSenate Bill 1385 was Youngkin\u2019s signature legislation, which a Democratic-controlled Senate Education and Health subcommittee defeated by a 6-4 vote. Sponsored by Sen. Steve Newman, R-Bedford, it would have banned most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation while making a violation of the law a Class 4 felony, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine.\n\nA companion bill that mirrors Newman\u2019s proposal has yet to be heard in the House of Delegates. House Bill 2278, sponsored by Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford County, has yet to be assigned to a committee. It is likely to pass in the House, but will face similar resistance in the Senate as Newman\u2019s bill.\n\nBoth Newman and Byron were part of a four-member panel appointed by Youngkin on the same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year to draft legislation using the 15-week threshold as its basis. The small group also included Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, and Del. Margaret Ransone, R-Westmoreland.\n\nYoungkin-spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said that as a pro-life governor, Youngkin was disappointed in Friday\u2019s votes, but that he would continue to work with the legislature to find a path forward for protecting life.\n\n\u201cPolling demonstrates that 82% of Virginians want a reasonable compromise on abortion,\u201d Porter said, referring to a recent poll by the Democrats for Life Education Fund.\n\n\u201cWhile Virginians have rejected Democrats\u2019 radical previous attempts for allowing abortion up until the moment of birth, now is the time to find common ground. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is focused on providing better quality healthcare for mothers and the unborn,\u201d Porter said, adding that Youngkin looks forward to the legislation being brought up in the House.\n\nAlso by a 6-4 vote, the panel nixed a more far-reaching measure by Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell County. SB 1284 sought to prohibit all abortions, with the exception of pregnancies that occurred through incest, rape or if the procedure is performed to safe the life of the mother. The bill also would have recognized that life begins at conception.\n\nA crowd waits for the subcommittee\u2019s decision on abortion bills.\n\nThe committee also rejected SB 1483, sponsored by Dunnavant, that would have limited abortions to \u201cduring the second trimester\u201d and before viability, which is defined in the legislation as 24 weeks or more or \u201cin the estimation of three doctors,\u201d but at least 22 weeks. Under current law, abortions are permitted up until the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, or about 26 weeks.\n\nNewman said on Friday that he viewed his proposal as the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d that both Republicans and Democrats should get behind.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a carefully crafted bill that establishes that certain types of abortions are still lawful, and there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother, and rape and incest in this bill,\u201d Newman told the committee, of which he is a member.\n\n\u201cThis bill does not remove the ability for miscarriage and stillbirth and in no way does this bill criminalize the woman at all,\u201d Newman said.\n\nSecretary of the Commonwealth Kay Cole James, who served as Virginia\u2019s Secretary of Health and Human Resources between 1994 and 1996 under then-Gov. George Allen, said Newman\u2019s bill addressed the needs and well-being of women and children and protected both.\n\n\u201cWe need not to pit the mother against the child,\u201d she said, adding that there are some who did not want to see the exceptions for rape and incest in the bill. \u201cWe need to find consensus on something that we as Virginians all ought to be able to come together on. Consensus by definition means that everybody doesn\u2019t get everything they want,\u201d James said.\n\nHackworth said of his measure, which would have banned abortion entirely with few exceptions, that he decided to file the bill because of his firm belief that life begins at conception.\n\n\u201cI know this is a sensitive subject and very emotional on both sides, and I want to respect that,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Dunnavant, a practicing OB-GYN who like Newman is a member of the committee, said that the purpose of her proposal was to move Virginia into a \u201cmuch more appropriate position\u201d and align Virginia with most European nations, where abortions are prohibited after 12 weeks.\n\n\u201cThe law that we have in place today in Virginia was written in 1975, and the advances in medicine are staggering and the stage of viability has moved,\u201d Dunnavant said. \u201cWe are outdated based on medical practices and on standards around the world. There are only seven states that have abortion in the third trimester unregulated.\u201d\n\nDunnavant was the only Republican on the committee who voted against Hackworth\u2019s proposal. She also voted against Newman\u2019s bill after he refused to consider her amendment to the latter that would have included an exception permitting abortion after 24 weeks in the case of a fetal anomaly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather keep the bill as it is, for better or worse,\u201d Newman said.\n\nAbortion rights groups celebrated the panel\u2019s decision to reject the proposals.\n\n\u201cThe bills the subcommittee considered today all seek to insert politics into healthcare and inappropriately restrict Virginians\u2019 ability to control their own bodies,\u201d said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. \u201cPeople in many different circumstances need access to abortion, and no one should make those personal decisions for someone else \u2014 especially not politicians.\u201d",

            "text": "The news: Most health system executives plan to ramp up their investments in interoperability solutions and services this year, according to Health Gorilla\u2019s 2023 State of Interoperability report.\n\nThe key findings: 55% of C-level executives at prominent health systems said they plan to spend 5% to 20% more on interoperability products and services in 2023 than they did last year.\n\n43% said they plan to invest about the same in interoperability year-over-year.\n\nsaid they plan to in interoperability year-over-year. Not a single respondent forecasted less YoY spending on interoperability-related initiatives.\n\nWhat do interoperability investments entail? Interoperability is a broad term. In this context, we\u2019re referring to investments in solutions and services that:\n\nImprove providers\u2019 ability to access and exchange health data from disparate tech systems. Make it easier for patients to digitally retrieve their medical information.\n\nWhy is the healthcare ecosystem so fragmented? Electronic health record (EHR) vendors have \u201ctrapped\u201d data in their tech systems, making it difficult for physicians to access patient information housed in different products.\n\nAnother factor is that patients aren\u2019t in control of their own data. When they ask for a copy of their medical records, hospitals and clinics typically make the process time-consuming and expensive. This prevents patients from bringing critical information like lab tests or medications to a new provider.\n\n\u201cThe feds are making me do it\u201d: Government-induced pressure is being put on stakeholders to make health data more transparent and accessible.\n\nAn information-blocking regulation inside the 21st Century Cures Act requires EHR vendors to unlock data in their systems so providers and patients can easily access it.\n\nThe rule also prevents hospitals and clinics from interfering with patients\u2019 rights to retrieve their health data upon request.\n\nAs of October 2022, the regulation applies to all health data, with few exceptions. Violators will be penalized on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThere are now ample market opportunities for startups and tech companies to create solutions that help EHR vendors and healthcare providers comply with new regulations. In 2021\u2014the year the regulation first went into effect\u2014VC funding for interoperability and health data infrastructure startups reached $2.2 billion, approximately tripling 2021\u2019s total, per May 2022 data from Rock Health.\n\nHealth systems and EHR companies are turning to cloud-based offerings from Big Tech players\u2014including Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare\u2014for data storage, management, exchange, and remote access. They\u2019re also partnering with third-party apps and platforms\u2014including Apple\u2014that enable consumers to access and download their data as they choose.",

            "text": "By FRANK BAJAK (AP Technology Writer)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile said Thursday that an unidentified malicious intruder breached its network in late November and stole data on 37 million customers, including addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth.\n\nT-Mobile said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the breach was discovered Jan. 5. It said the data exposed to theft \u2014 based on its investigation to date \u2014 did not include passwords or PINs, bank account or credit card information, Social Security numbers or other government IDs.\n\n\u201cOur investigation is still ongoing, but the malicious activity appears to be fully contained at this time,\u201d T-Mobile said, with no evidence the intruder was able to breach the company\u2019s network. It said the data was first accessed on or around Nov. 25.\n\nT-Mobile said it has notified law enforcement and federal agencies, which it did not name. It did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.\n\nThe company has been hacked multiple times in recent years. In its filing, T-Mobile said it did not expect the latest breach to have material impact on its operations. But a senior analyst for Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Neil Mack, said in a statement that the breach raises questions about management\u2019s cyber governance and could alienate customers and attract scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators.\n\n\u201cWhile these cybersecurity breaches may not be systemic in nature, their frequency of occurrence at T-Mobile is an alarming outlier relative to telecom peers,\u201d Mack said.\n\nIn July, T-Mobile agreed to pay $350 million to customers who filed a class action lawsuit after the company disclosed in August 2021 that personal data including Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license info had been stolen. Nearly 80 million U.S. residents were affected.\n\nIt also said at the time that it would spend $150 million through 2023 to fortify its data security and other technologies.\n\nPrior to the August 2021 intrusion, the company disclosed breaches in January 2021, November 2019 and August 2018 in which customer information was accessed.\n\nT-Mobile, based in Bellevue, Washington, became one of the country\u2019s largest cellphone service carriers in 2020 after buying rival Sprint. It reported having more than 102 million customers after the merger.",

            "text": "Reading Time: 5 minutes\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed by President Biden last November, is pouring billions of dollars into an upgrade of the country\u2019s aging water infrastructure. But a new study has found that white communities have been favored in distribution of the funds, something that\u2019s controlled by individual states.\n\nThe majority of the $55 billion allocated to water infrastructure will be distributed by states as part of low-interest revolving loan fund programs. A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council found communities of color are statistically less likely to receive the money compared to municipalities with larger white populations.\n\nBecky Hammer, who co-authored the report, said researchers focused on the state revolving fund because the program has been a major source of federal funding for wastewater and stormwater infrastructure projects in the country for decades and it got a significant boost thanks to the infrastructure bill.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of publicly available information about who is getting the money,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cWhen Congress was working on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we were asking them to put more money into the program to help address the huge backlog of infrastructure needs, but the question arose, how are the states doing at distributing the funding?\u201d\n\nFor this study, researchers with NRDC, a nonprofit international environmental advocacy group, analyzed allocation data for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund between 2011 and 2020.\n\nResearchers found that communities of color often bear the greatest burden of inequitable access to clean water infrastructure and have the most severe need for revolving fund resources. When the population of white people increases by 10%, there\u2019s a small increase in the possibility of receiving funds.\n\n\u201cWhile the magnitude of this discrepancy is relatively small, it is nonetheless concerning given the importance of distributional equity to the goals of the CWSRF program, and given the range of other barriers\u2014such as disproportionate environmental, socioeconomic, or health burdens\u2014making it more difficult for communities of color\n\nto complete infrastructure improvements,\u201d the report said.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the reason for this outcome, Hammer said, one factor is the broad discretion states have in distributing the funds.\n\n\u201cThere are a few choices that states make that tend to produce less equitable results,\u201d said Hammer, adding that some areas lacking basic sewage systems don\u2019t qualify for this type of federal funding.\n\nThe report blamed systemic racism and disinvestment for the rise in inequities in water infrastructure, adding that without federal funding water systems have to rely on local sources of revenue to pay for maintenance, which has deepened along racial and economic lines. On top of that, historically redlined communities are at a higher risk for urban flooding. Residents face rate hikes for water and sewer bills, creating water affordability challenges for many communities across the country. For communities that experienced white flight, revenue from billing may not be enough.\n\nThe NRDC report also recommends states update their project prioritization ranking system to \u201cgive greater weight to projects benefiting communities that are currently underserved\u201d and offer favorable loan terms to underserved applicants.\n\nAnother key policy recommendation is to provide technical assistance to water systems during the application process. That\u2019s because utility companies serving larger and wealthier communities employ in-house engineers and have resources to hire outside consultants to help them through the lengthy funding application while smaller communities do not have the technical capacity to apply for the funds.\n\nJennifer Sloan Ziegler, vice president for the American Society of Civil Engineers\u2019 Environmental and Water Resource Institute, said many water systems don\u2019t have the resources needed to even apply for the federal funds, such as hiring outside consultants to produce documentation that\u2019s required.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t apply, they will never get the money,\u201d Sloan Ziegler said. \u201cWe need a way to help disadvantaged communities pay for the upfront costs needed to apply.\u201d\n\nSloan Ziegler said the infrastructure bill was an important step in addressing aging water infrastructure. But according to an analysis by her organization, an additional $2.6 trillion in the next decade is needed.\n\nAdvocated point to the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972 as the last transformational investment in water infrastructure. It led to the construction of sewage treatment plants across the country. The federal government provided about 70% of the funds needed to build and upgrade treatment plants. By 1988, the federal government transitioned to a new system in which grants were replaced by subsidized loans from a \u201crevolving fund,\u201d according to the book, Water 4.0: The Past, Present, and Future of the World\u2019s Most Vital resource.\n\nWithout further direct federal funding, the popularity of the loan program grew. A second revolving fund was created when drinking water laws were tightened. The program is now one of the few federal funding sources to fund water and wastewater projects, according to the book.\n\nIn order to survive, many water systems delayed repairs. While the strategy of delaying maintenance worked in the short term, the failing systems now have public health implications.\n\nThe water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi is a clear example of how this dynamic has played out and the community is not alone.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Jackson will become more and more common across the United States,\u201d Sloan Ziegler said.\n\nFor years residents in Jackson have been forced to live without potable water for extended periods of time. Residents in this mostly Black city couldn\u2019t use the \u201ctea-colored\u201d water flowing from their faucets to brush their teeth, shower or cook following dozens of boil water advisories. Over the summer, the water stopped flowing altogether after flooding pushed the crumbling water system to a breaking point. That wasn\u2019t the first time, a 2021 winter storm left thousands of residents without running water, some for up to a month.\n\nLast year, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People stepped in accusing \u201cthe state of Mississippi of discrimination\u201d against Jackson\u2019s residents by \u201cdepriving the city of federal funds to maintain its public drinking water system in favor of funding smaller, majority white communities with less acute needs,\u201d the federal discrimination complaint filed on behalf of Jackson\u2019s residents said.\n\nWhile Jackson is the most populous city in the state, this majority-Black community only received federal funds from the \u201cDrinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund\u201d three times over the last 25 years.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake \u2013 this is nothing new.\u201d Our country has a longstanding history of mistreating, and neglecting Black communities, putting the lives of men, women, and children at risk,\u201d Abre\u2019 Conner, NAACP\u2019s director of environmental and climate justice said in a statement.\n\nIn October, the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation into these claims.\n\nSince the state revolving fund is one of the few federal sources of funding for water infrastructure, the NAACP discrimination complaint highlighted problems in how the state of Mississippi distributed these funds. According to the complaint, the additional funding allocated through the new infrastructure bill is not adequate.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese limits are plainly insufficient to address the grave problems facing Jackson\u2019s system and disparately treat residents who live in an area that is more than twice the population of any other entity in the State,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cHere again, Jackson \u2014 and its majority-Black population \u2014 are placed at a structural disadvantage when competing for federal funds.\u201d\n\nClarification: Jan. 20, 2023, 1:10 p.m. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the funding gap for water infrastructure was $2 trillion over the next decade. It should be $2.6 trillion.\n\nRelated\n\nHelp support this work",

            "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today applauded an announcement from the USDA Forest Service regarding expanded efforts to reduce wildfire risk in Utah and across the West. The Uinta-Wasatch\u2013Cache National Forest in Northern Utah and the Pine Valley area of the Dixie National Forest near St. George will receive increased funding to build critical infrastructure and strengthen wildfire resilience to protect from catastrophic wildfire\u2014made possible because of Senator Romney\u2019s involvement during Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act negotiations to ensure Utah had a seat at the table.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was proud to help negotiate the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which will better position Utah and our country to meet the infrastructure-related challenges of the 21st century,\u201d Senator Romney said. \u201cIt is imperative that we improve strategies which bolster wildfire resilience and prevent future wildfires from becoming catastrophic disasters in our state and across the West, which is why I worked to ensure funding for critical areas like the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache and Pine Valley projects was included in the bipartisan infrastructure bill. I appreciate Secretary Vilsack for implementing this funding, and I look forward to seeing these projects come to fruition to reduce wildfire risks and rehabilitate areas already affected.\u201d\n\n\n\nDetails on the USDA Forest Service Funding Announcement:\n\n\n\nWasatch Landscape Priority Investment Project\n\n\n\nThe Wasatch Landscape, part of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, is approximately 1.1 million acres, encompassing 714,000 acres of National Forest System lands. Approximately 382,000 acres, or 44 percent, of the Wasatch landscape is classified as a high or very high-risk fireshed, posing a considerable threat to the function of vital watersheds, plant and wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and private property.\n\n\n\nPine Valley Priority Landscape Project\n\n\n\nThe Pine Valley Landscape rests in the Dixie National Forest and is approximately 400,000 acres, encompassing 250,000 acres of National Forest System lands. Values at risk in this priority area include water quality, watershed health and resiliency, critical infrastructure including major national energy corridors, wildland-urban interface, and intermixed public and private land in St. George and adjacent communities.\n\n\n\nBackground on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act:\n\n\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, negotiated by Senator Romney and his colleagues, is bringing much-needed support to communities across the country to increase the resilience of lands facing the threat of wildland fires and to better support federal wildland firefighters. It includes $1.5 billion for the Department of Interior over the next five years to invest in preparedness, fuels management, post-fire restoration, and fire science. It also directs major reforms for federal wildland firefighters, including temporary pay increases and a new occupational series classification more specific to firefighters. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act investments in wildland fire management in Utah will increase fuels treatment in areas with high wildfire hazard potential, helping to protect homes and businesses in the wildland-urban interface and public drinking water. These efforts will promote climate resiliency across landscapes and communities and will employ Tribal members, youth, and veterans.",

            "text": "Regal Cinemas will close 39 of its U.S. theatres after its parent company Cineworld filed for bankruptcy last year.\n\nAccording to Variety, Cineworld will abandon leases for the 39 theaters starting Feb. 15. Cineworld said in the company\u2019s latest bankruptcy filing that the monthly rent per theater increased by nearly 30% between 2019 and 2022, despite a massive decline in domestic box office ticket sales during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nBusiness Insider reports that the Gallery Place Stadium 14 theatre in Washington, D.C., as well as the Bowie Stadium 14 and Rockville Center Stadium 13 theatres in Bowie and Rockville, are among the 39 theatres slated for closure.\n\nThe Regal Majestic theatre at 900 Ellsworth Dr. in the Downtown Silver Spring development, which was renovated in 2017, will remain open.\n\n\u201cIn total, the Debtors estimate that rejecting the Leases will save their estates approximately $22 million annually,\u201d Cineworld said in their latest bankruptcy filing.\n\nAccording to a statement released last year, Cineworld, which has theaters in ten countries, including the U.S. and UK, was experiencing low admissions due to a lack of big-budget movies and warned of the possibility of bankruptcy.\n\nCineworld filed for bankruptcy last September.\n\nRegal Cinemas shut down all 500 of its locations twice as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, following a cascade of postponements for big-budget Hollywood films.\n\n\u201cWe are like a grocery shop that doesn\u2019t have vegetables, fruit, meat,\u201d Cineworld CEO Mooky Greidinger said in an October 2020 interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe cannot operate for a long time without a product.\u201d\n\nSource file photo",
