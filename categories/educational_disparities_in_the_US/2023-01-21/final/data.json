            "text": "Earlier this week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis stood before an audience at a private, Christian all-boys school, ostensibly to celebrate the life of slain civil rights hero Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Republican governor, who is pushing hard to overhaul education in the Sunshine State, had more than King\u2019s legacy of fighting racial inequality on his agenda.\n\n\u201cDr. King understood that our rights are not given to us by the government, but are ours by the grace of God,\u201d the governor said. King \u201cwould be very pleased with the work you\u2019re doing at this school,\u201d he noted, adding that he is committed to expanding scholarships for more low-income students to attend private, religious schools like Piney Grove Boys Academy.\n\nDeSantis made no mention of how King might feel about a letter the Florida Department of Education sent to the College Board earlier this month, banning a new Advanced Placement course in African American studies now being piloted in 60 U.S. schools. DeSantis\u2019 education department is claiming the course is not \u201chistorically accurate\u201d and is \u201cinexplicably contrary to Florida law,\u201d while saying it \u201clacks educational value.\u201d\n\nRight now, it\u2019s unclear exactly what is in the curriculum of the first course in African American studies to be offered by the College Board, which also administers the SAT and AP exams. That\u2019s because the course framework isn\u2019t complete and the syllabus isn\u2019t publicly available yet.\n\nFlorida\u2019s latest ban follows a series of steps DeSantis, a potential Republican presidential candidate, has taken recently, including imposing speech codes on university professors and pushing the so-called \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d that restricts conversations on race and prohibits instruction that might cause guilt or shame for historic wrongdoings like slavery.\n\n\u201cFlorida is doing its best to tilt the scales and shut down important, much-needed discussions of race, slavery, stolen lands, and undeniable history that have led us to where we are as a society today.\u201d Democratic State Senator Shevrin Jones\n\nThere is also his \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law that limits discussion on sexual orientation and gender identity, all part of his efforts to exploit backlash against the recent Black Lives Matter movement and the country\u2019s reckoning with racism, inequality and intolerance.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of parents and school board members in Florida who applaud the governor\u2019s reactionary stance, at least publicly, although others are appalled at the power he is wielding over educators.\n\n\u201cFlorida is doing its best to tilt the scales and shut down important, much-needed discussions of race, slavery, stolen lands, and undeniable history that have led us to where we are as a society today,\u201d Senator Shevrin Jones, a Florida Democrat, said in a statement.\n\nMarvin Dunn, a former professor of psychology at Florida International University and a specialist in the state\u2019s Black history, told the Daily Beast on Thursday that the latest African American studies ban \u201cmeans an insult to me, it means an injury to me.\u201d\n\nHe added a dire warning: \u201cWhat just happened in Florida \u2026 is coming your way. This suppression of Black history is going to become a national thing if DeSantis and people who support him gain control of the federal government and the White House.\u201d\n\nRelated: In the wake of don\u2019t say gay lgbtq students won\u2019t be silenced\n\nClearly, though, it takes a lot of courage to confront or speak out against this governor, a national leader in restricting what teachers teach in their classrooms.\n\nHere\u2019s a great example: Presidents of the 28 state and community colleges in the Florida College System, which serves nearly 650,000 students, issued a collective statement this week, promising to not \u201csupport any institutional practice, policy, or academic requirement that compels belief in critical race theory or related concepts.\u201d\n\nThis came after DeSantis\u2019 budget office demanded that all the state\u2019s colleges submit information detailing how much they are spending on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, along with critical race theory, the legal concept holding that racial disparities in the U.S. are systemic.\n\nThe Florida Department of Education has also barred teaching lessons about The New York Times\u2019 1619 Project, which reframes the national narrative by centering slavery\u2019s consequences and the contributions of Black Americans.\n\nIn our own reporting on these issues at The Hechinger Report, we\u2019ve found that it is students who are often taking the lead and finding courage to combat the governor\u2019s agenda. Last spring, students at Winter Park High School organized to fight back, leading a school wide walkout and protesting the Parental Rights in Education Act that bans instruction on gay, lesbian or gender identity topics from kindergarten through third grade.\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, ranks second in the U.S. behind Texas with the most book bans, with 21 districts banning some 566 titles, most containing themes or characters related to the LGBTQ community and race.\n\nRelated: A lesson in hypocrisy what\u2019s really behind the parent choice movement\n\nAmong the more frustrating aspects of Florida\u2019s latest ban is the lack of information about what it is actually in the pilot African American studies course that DeSantis finds objectionable. A spokesman for the governor, Bryan Griffin, said in a statement to CNN that the course \u201cleaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow,\u201d although he added that DeSantis might reconsider if the course is amended and incorporates \u201chistorically accurate content.\u201d\n\nSharon Courtney, a history teacher using the course in Peekskill, New York, maintains that the course is factual, and told the Associated Press her students were shocked to learn of the ban.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing objectional. It\u2019s history that hasn\u2019t been traditionally taught in the United States in a K through 12 setting,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also history that once known and understood could change race relations and improve them.\u201d\n\nBooks from a pilot African American studies course now banned in Florida by Gov.

Ron DeSantis has been actively pushing to overhaul education in Florida, while also imposing speech and curriculum codes on university professors and banning a pilot Advanced Placement course in African American studies that he believes is \"not historically accurate\" and \u201clacks educational value\u201d. These actions are part of his effort to exploit backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement and other race conversations leading to criticism from Democrats like Senator Shevrin Jones who said it is \"tilting the scales\" when it comes to race discussions.
