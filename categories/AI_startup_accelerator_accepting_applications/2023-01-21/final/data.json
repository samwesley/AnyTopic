            "text": "The University of Chicago\u2019s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Data Science Institute today announced the launch of Transform, a new accelerator for startup companies focused on the breakthrough technologies of data science and artificial intelligence.\n\nHoused within the new Deep Tech Ventures initiative at the Polsky Center, Transform will provide full-spectrum support, including access to business and technical training, industry mentorship, venture capital connections, and funding opportunities, to early-stage companies utilizing advances in data science and AI.\n\nIn its first year, Transform is targeting two cohorts of up to 10 companies each. Startups accepted into the accelerator will receive approximately $250,000 in total investment, including $25,000 in funding, usage of UChicago computing resources, credits for Amazon Web Services and Google for Startups, workspace in the Polsky Exchange on Chicago\u2019s South Side, and access to industry mentors, technical advisors and student talent from the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science, Data Science Institute (DSI), and the Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nApplications for the inaugural Transform cohort are due January 25, 2023, an extension from the original January 20th deadline. Candidates should be focused on data-driven technologies, including AI and machine learning, data engineering, data analytics, applications in healthcare and biotech, cybersecurity, IoT, climate tech and environment, blockchain, social impact, transportation, fintech, transportation, agriculture, and others.\n\n\u201cThe Polsky Center continues to provide unparalleled support to early-stage startup ventures and the Transform accelerator is no different,\u201d said Dan Sachs, executive director of Polsky Deep Tech Ventures. \u201cWe are confident that data science and AI startups can accelerate their ability to bring innovations to market with venture capital connections and funding opportunities from the Polsky Center. And our partners at the Data Science Institute at the university can provide the deep, focused, technical guidance and access to industry-specific mentors that we know are invaluable resources to today\u2019s entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nData science and AI are two of the most transformative technologies this century, with the potential to revolutionize virtually every industry and field of study. The University of Chicago is at the heart of these scientific innovations. In the last five years, the Departments of Computer Science and Statistics have added more than 40 new faculty, most of which specialize in AI, machine learning, data science and data engineering. The Data Science Institute, launched in 2021, executes the University\u2019s bold, innovative vision of data science as a new discipline, seeding interdisciplinary research, forming partnerships with industry, government, and social impact organizations, and supporting holistic data science education.\n\n\u201cAt the University of Chicago, we are privileged to push forward the research frontiers of computer and data science in a community with world-leading experts in economics, biological and physical sciences, law and public policy, and other fields,\u201d said Michael J. Franklin, faculty co-director of the Data Science Institute, Liew Family Chair of Computer Science, and Senior Advisor to the Provost for Computation and Data Science. \u201cThis fertile intellectual landscape is the ideal environment for founding new businesses that apply the latest breakthroughs in data science and AI for vital opportunities across sectors.\u201d\n\nThe City of Chicago also boasts a growing reputation for tech entrepreneurship. In 2021, Chicago-based venture capital firms raised more than $5.7 billion, while nine Chicago-based companies crossed the $1 billion-plus \u201cunicorn\u201d valuation level \u2013 the third-highest total in the country. The Chicago tech ecosystem also leads the nation in diversity, with 34 percent of Chicago\u2019s startups run by women and 26 percent of the tech workforce identifying as Black or Latinx \u2014 more than three times the national average.\n\nTransform will use a proven formula developed by Duality, the nation\u2019s first quantum science and technology accelerator, run by the Polsky Center and the Chicago Quantum Exchange. Since its launch in April 2021, Duality has supported 11 quantum-focused startups across two cohorts, with member companies successfully achieving government funding and industry acquisition. In May 2022, Duality member Super.tech \u2013 founded by UChicago Computer Science Professor Fred Chong and PhD graduate Pranav Gokhale \u2013 was acquired by global quantum leader ColdQuanta.\n\nStartups under the Deep Tech Ventures program will have access to various funding mechanisms. Deep Tech Ventures expects to raise an external $25 million venture fund in 2023 to support deep tech startups looking for seed-stage and Series A funding. As part of Deep Tech Ventures, Transform will help up to 20 startups per year grow their businesses in the Chicago area. The program is open to all members of the Chicago tech community, and not limited to UChicago-based startups.\n\n\u201cTransform offers a robust combination of resources, training, and funding that will provide invaluable support to the tech startup community,\u201d said Shyama Majumdar, director of Transform. \u201cI am most excited about the mentorship program and the top-notch student talent we are able to offer from the Chicago Booth School of Business and the Data Science Institute. We have a pool of fantastic mentors ready to roll up their sleeves and work with the teams.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for early-stage startups that combine technological innovation and a creative product idea with both market potential and societal benefits,\u201d said Dan Nicolae, faculty co-director of the Data Science Institute and Professor of Statistics, Human Genetics, Medicine, Section of Genetic Medicine and the College. \u201cThe mission of the Data Science Institute is to develop data science as an emerging new discipline, from education and basic research through interdisciplinary application and entrepreneurship. Transform bolsters this vision, creating the unique opportunity to translate foundational discoveries in data science and AI into technologies that address the most important real-world challenges.\u201d\n\n\u2014A version of this story was published on the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship Innovation.",
