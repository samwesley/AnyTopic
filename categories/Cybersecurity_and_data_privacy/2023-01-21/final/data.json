            "text": "stock.adobe.com/ArtemisDiana\n\nOver the last few years, trends in cybersecurity have forced the responsbility of keeping networks and systems secure to shift from a handful of IT and security professionals to the entire organization. Now, cybersecuirty is becoming a significant part of any business in the digital era.\n\nOrganizations are hard-pressed to do anything new or innovate without considering the cybersecurity implications, and business executives are making sure\u2013or at least should be making sure\u2013that innovation happens with the consent of the cybersecurity team.\n\n\u201cNow what we\u2019re being told as a line of business, is that we have to be in lock step with cybersecurity,\u201d says Theresa Lanowitz, head of evangelism and portfolio marketing for AT&T Cybersecurity.\n\nThings have shifted dramatically over the last handful of years, with the previous model of investing in cybersecurity as needs or incidents arise becoming a risky practice that could spell disaster for any organization.\n\nNow, the \u201csweet spot\u201d for security investment for any new initiative is between 11% and 21% upfront, says Lanowitz, citing companies\u2019 testimonials to the telecommunications giant.\n\nBecause of the heightened importance given to cybersecurity, there is a growing level of cross-functional support in both the culture and budget of organizations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing cybersecurity step out of the shadows, become a full business partner and become something that the line of business is investing in and expecting,\u201d Lanowitz says.\n\nIn short, cybersecurity should have the proverbial full seat at the table at any organization.\n\nHowever, that strategy is now a baseline, and organizations must be in line with current trends in IT and cybersecurity so they don\u2019t fall behind. According to Lanowitz, there are eight key trends shaping the cybersecurity landscape in 2023.\n\n5G and the edge\n\nAccording to Lanowitz, the new era of computing is underpinned by 5G and edge technologies. While vendors and businesses have different definitions of edge, Lanowitz says the technology can largely be defined as a software-defined distributed model of management, intelligence and networks with applications, workloads and hosting close to users and assets that are generating or consuming the data.\n\nEdge use cases are generally driven by the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect and transmit data to make logical decisions to derive an outcome, and the new year should bring about an accelerated full-scale roll out of use cases. Those use cases include real-time fraud detection for financial services, automated warehousing with real-tine inventory management and near real-time visual inspections for manufacturing lines, border crossings and available parking spaces, to name a few.\n\nHowever, these edge use cases require connected systems from the network layer through to application monitoring and management, and each component needs to be secure.\n\n\u201cWith more democratized computing, security is no longer isolated,\u201d Lanowitz says. \u201cIt is central to delivering strong business outcomes.\u201d\n\nFor successful implementations with security at the core, decades-old siloes such as networking, IT, app development and security will need to fade away to enable more cross-functional work, Lanowitz says.\n\nDisaggregation of the Network\n\nAccording to Lanowitz, disaggregation of the network, or separating it into component parts, means that security tools can actually become part of the network. New types of networks will have more inherent security built in than previous generations.\n\nWith the move to the edge, which is software-defined, disaggregated networks can bring in the security components needed at a specific time, Lanowitz says.\n\n\u201cSo if somebody accidentally clicks on a malicious link, rather than having that malware spread through the whole network, with a disaggregated network, what you can do is you can say, \u2018All right, I know there\u2019s a problem here.\u2019 And it\u2019s going to basically self-heal. It\u2019ll disaggregate into itself and spin up a new version.\u201d\n\nWhile new and still conceptual, Lanowitz predicts this cybersecurity trend to emerge in 2023.\n\nSecuring the Data Lifecycle\n\nAccording to Lanowitz, edge computing is all about the collection, use and enrichment of data. In edge use cases such as manufacturing assembly lines, the data is hosted and consumed right there using a series of cameras and sensors.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not backhauling data to the data center for some sort of analytical program to go through it,\u201d Lanowitz says. \u201cIt\u2019s near-real time.\u201d\n\nWith that near real-time data the most important part of edge computing, it must be protected, in-tact and usable. Organizations should expect to see more solutions designed around the data lifecycle and to help organizations make sure that data governance policies are automated and enforced.\n\nThat is especially true as more edge applications are deployed and the amount of data being generated multiplies at a rapid pace.\n\nApplications: Built-in Security\n\nApplications are central in the new software-defined business world, but applications are the last frontier of an ecosystem built with security in mind, Lanowitz says.\n\nIn 2001, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) was formed to identify the most common web app security vulnerabilities. In the 21 years since, the OWASP\u2019s top 10 web application security risks have not seen meaningful shifts.\n\nThe application is the last mile connecting the user, and as organizations move to the edge, we\u2019ll start to see more applications that are non-GUI based and aren\u2019t traditional transactional types of applications.\n\n\u201cDevices running on the edge will be running headless applets, which will have to transfer data back and forth,\u201d Lanowitz says. \u201cSo, the idea of building security from the beginning becomes incredibly important.\u201d\n\nThat will force different departments in organizations to work more closely, as software development teams will work in tandem with security, operations, networking and business teams.\n\nThat will also put more emphasis on securing the software supply chain and software bills of materials (SBOM).\n\n\u201cThe SBOM, the focus on software-defined and the edge coming together will hopefully create that perfect storm \u2026 and really spur on the idea of application security and make it more mainstream,\u201d Lanowitz says.\n\nBiometric Security\n\nThe cybersecurity community is trending towards multiple and different types of authentication methods, including biometrics such as face scanning, fingerprints and more.\n\nAccording to Lanowitz, most people have pictures of themselves online, even if they are not active on social media. This makes it relatively easy for bad actors to create digital twins of a person based on a quick internet search. The technology to do so will only improve over time.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the next frontiers,\u201d Lanowitz says. \u201cOne of the next opportunities for security is the idea of being able to secure biometrics and digital twins.\u201d\n\nThe more we use biometrics for authentication methods, the more we\u2019ll give bad actors an opportunity to create deep fakes.\n\n\u201cBiometric security is going to be something we\u2019ll see a lot more of, and I think we need to get used to it,\u201d Lanowitz says.\n\nThreat Intelligence\n\nGathering information on attacks from a variety of sources and publishing those findings for the entire IT and security community to consume will continue to be an essential part of cybersecurity.\n\nHowever, that threat intelligence this year will become more relevant and curated. For example, the manufacturing industry should be less concerned about attacks impacting the financial service sector and more concerned with security risks faced in their particular market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get to this point of relevance and then curation,\u201d Lanowitz says. \u201cYou have all this data coming at you and all this information coming at you, but the more curated and relevant it is for you, the more it will help you make those decisions.\u201d\n\nIoT Cybersecurity\n\nAlong with protecting digital assets from hackers and keeping data safe, another cybersecurity trend defenders now have to think about how to keep devices capable of causing physical harm out of the hands of bad actors. For example, machines connected to the internet such as a construction tool or a medical device must be secured.\n\nAs new AI-driven, internet-connected technology finds its way into cars and other vehicles, these physical devices are now considered endpoints. As such, they need to be protected like a regular endpoint. However, organizations now also need to ensure that these new categories of online devices are also free from physical harm.\n\n\u201cSafety critical devices are the ones that should really give you more pause,\u201d Lanowitz says.\n\nMoving to the Edge\n\nAs companies continue to move to the edge, data and application security will be increasingly embedded from the beginning, and Lanowitz predicts 2023 as a big year for that movement.\n\nCompanies \u201cborn on the edge\u201d will continue the tech disruption that we\u2019ve seen with companies \u201cborn on the web.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompanies born on the edge aren\u2019t going to have to deal with legacy software,\u201d Lanowitz says. \u201cThey\u2019ll have application security built into everything they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ll have data governance and data security built into everything. They\u2019ll have biometric security built into everything.\u201d",

            "text": "The U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile said Thursday that an unidentified malicious intruder breached its network in late November and stole data on 37 million customers, including addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth.\n\nT-Mobile said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the breach was discovered Jan. 5. It said the data exposed to theft \u2014 based on its investigation to date \u2014 did not include passwords or PINs, bank account or credit card information, Social Security numbers or other government IDs.\n\n\u201cOur investigation is still ongoing, but the malicious activity appears to be fully contained at this time,\u201d T-Mobile said, with no evidence the intruder was able to breach the company\u2019s network. It said the data was first accessed on or around Nov. 25.\n\nT-Mobile said it has notified law enforcement and federal agencies, which it did not name. It did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.\n\nThe company has been hacked multiple times in recent years. In its filing, T-Mobile said it did not expect the latest breach to have material impact on its operations. But a senior analyst for Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Neil Mack, said in a statement that the breach raises questions about management\u2019s cyber governance and could alienate customers and attract scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators.\n\n\u201cWhile these cybersecurity breaches may not be systemic in nature, their frequency of occurrence at T-Mobile is an alarming outlier relative to telecom peers,\u201d Mack said.\n\nIn July, T-Mobile agreed to pay $350 million to customers who filed a class action lawsuit after the company disclosed in August 2021 that personal data including Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license info had been stolen. Nearly 80 million U.S. residents were affected.\n\nIt also said at the time that it would spend $150 million through 2023 to fortify its data security and other technologies.\n\nPrior to the August 2021 intrusion, the company disclosed breaches in January 2021, November 2019 and August 2018 in which customer information was accessed.\n\nT-Mobile, based in Bellevue, Washington, became one of the country\u2019s largest cellphone service carriers in 2020 after buying rival Sprint. It reported having more than 102 million customers after the merger.",

            "text": "Credit: Golden Dayz Shutterstock\n\nGrowing public awareness of data privacy issues has pressured countries to introduce more stringent privacy laws. However, in the future, emerging technologies such as the metaverse, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) will make the enforcement of data privacy regulations more challenging.\n\nA history of data privacy regulation\n\nAt its inception, the internet was designed to be free, open, and innovative. At first, most governments adopted a light regulatory touch, allowing companies to grow with little intervention. As a result, companies like Facebook flourished with business models based on targeted advertising. Targeted advertising refers to advertisements that are served to a specific audience. The target of that advert is determined using user data sold by companies like Facebook to advertising agencies.\n\nPublic awareness of data privacy issues eventually pressured countries to enact more stringent data privacy laws, with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being the gold standard of data privacy regulation. The GDPR sets out a legal framework for keeping citizens\u2019 personal data safe by requiring companies to have robust processes in place for handling and storing personal information. The GDPR has cumulatively fined tech companies over $2.9 billion between 2018 and 2022. Although this is a large sum, enforcement frameworks remain extremely underfunded and short-staffed, and these fines remain a slap on the wrist for most Big Tech companies.\n\nThe GDPR promotes a \u2018privacy by design\u2019 approach in which companies are encouraged to adhere to data protection policies as an integral feature of data processing technologies. While European regulators have confirmed that the GDPR will apply to the metaverse and other related technologies operating within the EU, the enforcement of data privacy regulations will be incredibly challenging.\n\nData privacy in the metaverse\n\nThe metaverse is a virtual world where users share experiences and interact in real-time within simulated scenarios. It has been marketed as a revolutionary technology that will change how we shop, work, learn, socialize, and consume media content. Companies like Meta, Epic Games, and Microsoft have poured billions of dollars of investment into metaverse technologies and content. Nevertheless, the metaverse remains in its infancy.\n\nGlobalData\u2019s TMT Predictions 2023 report predicts that there will be a metaverse winter in 2023. Tech giants will continue to invest, but there will be less venture capital activity and fewer deals in the space. The year will not produce substantial returns instead, it will give an opportunity for underlying technologies, like AR and VR, to mature.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much this \u2018winter\u2019 will hamper the metaverse\u2019s long-term potential. However, one of its biggest obstacles will be public concern regarding data privacy. Multi-sensory experiences in the metaverse will expand the scope of data privacy beyond the normal data points to include emotional, biometric, and physiological data, meaning users will be monitored at an almost forensic level. This will make enforcement of data privacy regulation far more challenging. Firstly, it is unclear whether current data privacy regulations, aside from the GDPR, are legally applicable to new technologies. Secondly, while current regulations address billions of data points shared between users and tech companies, the metaverse and related technologies will give companies access to trillions of more invasive data points. There is already a lack of resources when it comes to enforcing data privacy laws, which will only worsen as we embark on an immersive future in the metaverse if regulators are not adequately prepared.\n\nLooking forward\n\nRegulators must draft legal frameworks with robust compliance processes that consider the potential dangers of the emergence of more invasive technologies with access to biometric data. Government resources will always be limited when it comes to data privacy enforcement, however, regulators can improve efficiency by using artificial intelligence and other technologies to track Big Tech activity in the data privacy space.\n\nWhen the GDPR and other legal frameworks are expanded to cover the metaverse, the metaverse may see its functionality challenged. For instance, how can Meta render real-time avatars of people in the metaverse if it is not allowed to capture the biometric data needed to mimic the movement of people? Therefore, developers must collaborate with government entities to develop the technology with data privacy regulation in mind.",

            "text": "T-Mobile has disclosed a new, enormous breach that occurred in November, which was the result of the compromise of a single application programming interface (API). The result? The exposure of the personal data of more than 37 million prepaid and postpaid customer accounts.\n\nFor those keeping track, this latest disclosure marks the second sprawling T-Mobile data breach in two years and more than a half-dozen in the past five years.\n\nAnd they've been expensive.\n\nLast November, T-Mobile was fined $2.5 million for a 2015 data breach by the Massachusetts attorney general. Another 2021 data leak cost the carrier $500 million; $350 million in payouts to affected customers, and another $150 million pledged toward upgrading security through 2023.\n\nNow the telecom giant is mired in yet another cybersecurity incident.\n\nT-Mobile's Cybersecurity Snafu\n\nThe threat actor who claimed to be behind the 2021 breach of 54 million T-Mobile customers, past, present and prospective, John Binns, bragged in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that T-Mobile's \"awful\" security made his job easy.\n\nBut an infrastructure like T-Mobile's means it's tough to cover the entire attack surface, making their systems particularly complicated to shore up, Justin Fier, senior vice president for red-team operations with Darktrace, tells Dark Reading.\n\n\"Like most big brands, T-Mobile has a very complex and sprawling digital estate,\" Fier explains. \"It is becoming harder by the day to gain visibility into every aspect of that estate and make sense of the data, which is why we\u2019re increasingly seeing firms lean on technology to perform that role.\"\n\nHowever, he adds that breaching a vulnerable API doesn't require much know-how on the part of an attacker.\n\nBesides weak API security, Mike Hamilton CISO of Critical Insight, tells Dark Reading that this latest compromise also demonstrates a lack of network visibility and ability to detect abnormal behavior.\n\n\"Details are scant, and there has been no attribution of the 'bad actor,' who apparently had access to data for about 10 days before being stopped,\" Hamilton says.\n\nT-Mobile's Next Regulator Bout\n\nIn the disclosure of the cybersecurity incident, T-Mobile downplayed the stolen account information, adding the data was \"basic,\" and \"widely available in marketing databases.\" While it might read like a glib dismissal of the impact on its customers, the distinction could protect the company from state regulators, Hamilton adds.\n\n\"The data may be monetized by selling in bulk, although it's of little actual value,\" Hamilton says. \"Most of the data in the theft can be found in public sources and is unlikely to cause legal action from state privacy statutes like the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).\"\n\nHowever, T-Mo might have more trouble in Europe with GDPR and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) regulators in the UK, Tim Cope, CISO of NextDLP, explains to Dark Reading. Penalties like these ultimately will drive investment in the necessary cybersecurity protections, he adds.\n\n\"The regulatory oversight of the ICO and GDPR should hopefully bring a large series of fines along with these privacy breaches,\" Cope says, \"which should in turn feed more investment into security teams to help build better controls to guard APIs against the current and future attacks.\"",

            "text": "Email marketing firm MailChimp this week confirmed that it experienced a data breach after hackers infiltrated an internal customer support and account administration tool. The attackers accessed the data of 133 users by using employee credentials acquired in a social engineering attack aimed at MailChimp staff and contractors. The company first detected an unauthorized individual accessing their system support tools on January 11. Fortunately, MailChimp was able to act quickly, temporarily suspending the accounts where suspicious activity was logged and notifying the primary contacts for all impacted accounts less than twenty-four hours after the breach was discovered. Though the number of affected customers is small, one of them was the popular WooCommerce eCommerce plugin for WordPress, which warned users that the incident exposed their names, store URLs, addresses, and email addresses. MailChimp told Bleeping Computer, \u201cWhile we do not share customer information as a matter of course, we can share that no credit card or password information was compromised as a result of this incident.\u201d An investigation is ongoing.\n\nSwift disclosure by MailChimp.\n\nMailChimp's response strikes some observers as setting a good example for businesses generally. Dr. Ilia Kolochenko, Founder of ImmuniWeb, and a member of Europol Data Protection Experts Network, wrote to comment on the company's reaction. It's not a large incident, but MailChimp disclosed unusually quickly and completely.\n\n\u201cThe unauthorized access to 133 customer accounts is a very insignificant security incident for such a large company as Mailchimp. Transparent disclosure of the incident rather evidences a well-established DFIR process and high standards of ethics at Mailchimp, as most businesses of q similar size will likely try to find a valid excuse to avoid mandatory disclosure prescribed by law or imposed by contractual duties. The reported attack vector of social engineering and password reuse remains extremely efficient today, many large businesses regularly fall victim to it despite multilayered cyber-defense and most advanced security controls. Moreover, the reportedly compromised account of a technical support specialist likely had access to a much larger number of customer accounts, evidencing that the incident was timely detected and contained.\u201d\n\nThe MailChimp incident and the importance of zero trust.\n\nGal Helemski, co-founder & CTO/CPO, PlainID sees the incident as showing the importance of zero trust.\n\n\"In attacks such as this, identity is the solution for finding the adversary and eliminating it from systems. Organizations must adopt a \u201cZero Trust\u201d approach, which means trusting no one \u2013 not even known users or devices \u2013 until they have been verified and validated. Access policies and dynamic authorizations are a crucial part of the zero-trust architecture, as they help to verify who is requesting access, the context of the request, and the risk of the access environment.\n\n\"Instead of pouring more money into a shotgun approach to security, organizations need a more focused strategy oriented toward purchasing the highest reward tools. Identity and authorization are where the smart money should be going. If we assume hackers are already in the network, it makes sense to focus budgets on technologies that restrict movement inside the network.\"\n\nJustin McCarthy, co-founder and CTO, StrongDM, notes that there are probably data other than email accounts of interest to attackers. \u201cThe recent Mailchimp incident has security experts now pondering if the bad actors are going after email accounts, it\u2019s safe to say they are also going after your data, data stores, repos, APIs and more. Ensuring that access is secured for all users -- admins, developers, analysts and more -- is critical in keeping your company and customers safe. One way to accomplish this is to eliminate credentials all together and move to just-in-time access or Zero Standing Privilege.\u201d\n\nBest practices in defense against social engineering.\n\nTyler Farrar, CISO, Exabeam, sees a familiar lesson: the value of following best practices. \u201cAdversaries are always going to go for the path of least resistance to meet their end goal. The threat actors who conducted this social engineering attack were likely not going after Mailchimp, but the organizations the email platform works with. Rather than attempt to attack each of the customers individually, the adversary probably figured it would be easier to break through into Mailchimp. Unfortunately, attacks like these are going to become more and more common. The software supply chain is going to become the number one threat vector in 2023. As a result, organizations should create a vendor risk management plan, thoroughly vet third parties and require accountability to remain vigilant and align to cybersecurity best practices.\u201d\n\nErfan Shadabi, cybersecurity expert with data security specialists comforte AG, draws lessons that any organization might profit from.\n\n\u201cThis cybersecurity incident shows just how clever threat actors can be in adapting existing social engineering tactics. The situation also underscores two key points that every enterprise should heed.\n\n\"One, it\u2019s not enough simply to educate employees and partners sporadically about common social engineering tactics and hope that this makes a significant impact on incident prevention or mitigation. The entire corporation needs to adopt a culture of cybersecurity in which speed and rapidity are valued less than safety and sensible inspection of all requests for information and action. Social engineering preys on misdirection and hasty actions and responses. Put a premium on employees treating every email with healthy skepticism.\n\n\"Two, protect all sensitive enterprise data with more than just perimeter security, even if you feel that the impenetrable vault you\u2019ve stored it all in is foolproof. Make sure that data-centric protection such as tokenization or format-preserving encryption effectively obfuscate sensitive information in case threat actors find their way into your data ecosystem. At some point, every organization will face a cybersecurity attack, so better be prepared.\u201d\n\nChris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy, urges that organizations like MailChimp look to increased security awareness training. \u201cOrganizations like this should not only tighten their security measures, they should also put in place training programs for employees and executives, educating them about phishing attacks like the one that facilitated these breaches.\u201d\n\nSocial engineering does indeed require training if employees, and hence organizations, are to build up resistance. Almog Apirion, CEO and Co-Founder of Cyolo, wrote:\n\n\u201cWithin one year, MailChimp has suffered three data breaches as a result of social engineering attacks, with one of the worst-case scenarios \u2013 a breach that seems to be very similar to previous ones. So, what is going wrong? It is far too often that employees fall for phishing attacks that place sensitive company assets and personal information at risk of malicious threats. Social engineering attacks make employees particularly vulnerable by using psychological manipulation to take advantage of weak security protocols. It is not surprising that the riskiest attack vector is the human behind the network, system or application. Beyond, the rise of remote work has presented new challenges for companies implementing perimeter security systems. Companies must consider how to extend security controls to all users, even hybrid employees and third parties outside of the corporate network.\n\n\"Companies should prioritize securing identities \u2013 the new perimeter for many organizations. By increasing the adoption of zero-trust practices, businesses can ensure the validation of all users, limit the applications each user is entitled to and capture a full audit trail for forensic and compliance needs.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, social engineering attacks are to be expected. After all, they work. Leonid Belkind, CTO and co-founder at Torq, said, \u201cThe MailChimp hack is emblematic of the urgent need to closely calibrate cybersecurity systems to proactively address these inevitable attacks. The advent of sophisticated security automation can play an important role in mitigating these scenarios. By granularly calibrating security tools, so they work together in concert to identify, alert, and remediate these attacks, security automation can add a critical layer of protection that is missing in countless enterprise security configurations.\u201d",

The screening program grew out of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and involves airlines comparing their passenger records with federal data to keep dangerous people off planes.\n\nThe Daily Dot, a tech news outlet, first reported on the alleged data breach.\n\nIn a memo to current and former CommuteAir employees obtained by CNN, the airline said it discovered a data breach in November in which an \u201cunauthorized party\u201d also accessed personal information held by the airline, including names, birthdays and the last four digits of Social Security numbers.\n\n\u201cWe are \u2026 working closely with law enforcement to ensure the incident is properly addressed,\u201d CommuteAir said in the memo.\n\nThe hacker and security researcher claiming to have accessed the no-fly list data says she is 23 years old and based in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cIt should never be this easy to just completely (breach) an entire airline,\u201d the hacker, who goes by the name maia arson crimew, told CNN. She shared samples of the data to support her claim. The list included names of known or suspected terrorists and their birthdays, including that of convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, whom the Biden administration recently sent back to Russia in a prisoner exchange for WNBA star Brittney Griner.\n\nThe Swiss hacker says she used to go by the name Tillie Kottmann. A person by that name was indicted by a US grand jury in 2021 for allegedly being part of a conspiracy that hacked dozens of companies and government organizations and posted stolen data online.\n\nThe hacker has often claimed to be exposing overly broad surveillance programs. She was allegedly part of a group of hackers that breached US security camera maker Verkada in 2021 and reportedly accessed live feeds of thousands of the company\u2019s cameras in hospitals and prisons.",

            "text": "Rubrik has achieved half a billion in annual recurring revenues and gained a trophy board member, Mark McLaughlin, Qualcomm chairman. Is that an IPO we\u2019re smelling?\n\nRubrik is notable not least because it has raised an astonishing $552 million in funding since it was founded in 2014, but because it started out doing data protection and now cybersecurity is its main product focus.\n\nIt\u2019s now marketing a security cloud service with three pillars: data resilience, data observability, and data remediation. In one way the ransomware plague has presented all data protection and security suppliers with a growing market opportunity, which Rubrik has grasped with both hands.\n\nWe should understand, Rubrik claims, that it is a high-growth business and it is responding to business\u2019s cybersecurity needs better than any other supplier.\n\nMark McLaughlin\n\nIncoming board member Mark McLaughlin mentions these points in a blog on Rubrik\u2019s website.\n\nHe has an impressive CV, going to West Point and then becoming a Cobra helicopter pilot at Fort Rucker, Alabama, where he was involved in a crash that severely damaged his back. It took months to recover. After that, with flying no longer an option, he went to law school and then became a lawyer for Cooley Godward in 1994, but left a year later as a client recruited him for an in-house position. That was as general counsel of Caere Corp, an OCR software company.\n\nMcLaughlin became VP for Business Development at Gemplus in 1997, then VP of sales and business development for internet payment company Signio, which was bought by Verisign in 1999. McLaughlin was involved in the acquisition and became an EVP at Verisign in 2000, then president and COO, then CEO, retaining the other titles, in 2009. This was followed by a risk-taking jump into network security business startup Palo Alto Networks as its chairman, president and CEO in 2011.\n\nThat year he was also appointed to the US National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee and has served on it ever since.\n\nPalo Alto Networks filed for and ran an IPO in 2012, raising $260 million with its shares jumping 27 percent above their opening price. McLaughlin stayed as CEO until 2018 when he went upstairs to become vice chairman, leaving that role in December last year. He had also become chairman of wireless semiconductor supplier Qualcomm in 2019 and a board member at Snorkel AI in January 2022.\n\nIn his Rubrik blog, entitled \u201cHonored to be on the Rubrik Journey,\u201d McLaughlin writes: \u201cThe continued rise of the importance of cyber, and the continued rise in the sophistication of the attacker will be addressed over time by continuous innovation, collaboration, and the rise of cyber security data platforms. Rubrik steps into that need with its data security platform focused on ransomware, one of the scourges of our digital age.\n\n\u201cWhen you take on big problems with oversized consequences on every organization in the world, it creates the opportunity for significant value creation for customers and fast growth. Rubrik is experiencing tremendous demand, and is continuing to grow its customer base. This growth in new customer acquisition, as well as continued innovation and value creation for customers, is most evident in Rubrik\u2019s recently announced $500 million in annual recurring revenue; and achieving a net dollar retention rate of greater than 140 percent.\n\n\u201cIt is the combination of scale and velocity of growth that creates truly unique companies and significant value creation.\u201d\n\nBipul Sinha\n\nThere\u2019s definitely a financial aroma of value creation in the air here. Can you smell it? It\u2019s the hint of IPO, that most beguiling perfume for VCs. Backup is old hat. Nobody is interested in a backup company\u2019s IPO; are you listening, Cohesity? But a data security company, with an answer to the biggest cybersecurity scourge on the planet? We think Rubrik co-founder and CEO Bipul Sinha believes he has an IPO in his grasp.\n\nAnd he\u2019s recruited a security-savvy board member with IPO experience who can talk to bankers and investors and other financial people. A Rubrik IPO appears to be coming, later this year or early in 2024. That\u2019s what Blocks & Files thinks anyway.",

            "text": "London \u2014 The social media platform TikTok has been in American lawmakers' crosshairs for months, and the sentiment is spreading across the Atlantic. European legislators are voicing increasing concern about the Chinese-owned app's data policies and its influence on young people, and Europe's regulators may have more potent legal weapons at their disposal to challenge the company.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been the highest-profile European leader to criticize the social platform whose parent company ByteDance is based in China. At an event on mental health in December, Macron called TikTok \"the most disruptive\" social media outlet for young people, warning that it was \"deceptively innocent\" and addictive.\n\n\"We remain vigilant in any situation that would lead to a compromise in the protection of our citizens' data,\" Jean-Noel Barrot, France's Minister for Digital Transition and Telecommunications, told CBS News, adding that he meets \"on a regular basis\" with TikTok managers in France to discuss \"data protection issues and content moderation and protection of minors.\"\n\nGerman Member of the European Parliament Moritz K\u00f6rner has been pushing EU regulators to get tough on TikTok for years.\n\n\"From a geopolitical perspective, the EU's inactivity towards TikTok has been na\u00efve,\" he told CBS News. \"The data dragon TikTok must be placed under the surveillance of the European authorities.\"\n\nK\u00f6rner said the EU has been slow to implement oversight of the platform, arguing that Tiktok \"poses several unacceptable risks\" for users, including \"data access by Chinese authorities, censorship and the tracking of journalists.\"\n\nMaximilian Funke-Kaiser, a spokesman for Germany's liberal FDP party, told CBS News that TikTok has been guilty of \"systematic data misuse\" and said that security concerns about the app are \"justified.\"\n\n\"To be clear: If you do business here and earn a lot of money with it, you must also comply with applicable law. Otherwise, there is no room for the company here,\" he said.\n\nFunke-Kaiser said steps taken by the U.S. government to ban the platform for employee use were something that should be replicated in Germany.\n\n\"I consider the ban on TikTok on working equipment of officials of the U.S. government to be appropriate in view of the data protection and security risks,\" he said.\n\nResponding to the concerns voiced by European officials, a TikTok spokesperson told CBS News in an email that the company had responded to the ban in the U.S. by putting together \"a comprehensive package of measures with layers of government and independent oversight to ensure that there are no backdoors into TikTok that could be used to manipulate the platform.\"\n\n\"These measures go beyond what any peer company is doing today on security,\" the TikTok spokesperson said.\n\nLegal challenges\n\nWhile the United States has taken the step of banning TikTok on government devices in the name of national security, wide-ranging EU data protection laws already on the books could become an even bigger headache for TikTok executives.\n\nTikTok is currently the subject of two investigations by Ireland's data protection regulator over transfers of user data to China that may breach the country's laws, as well as possible violations of children's privacy.\n\nThe company may also come under a direct audit and face fines of up to 6% of the platform's annual revenue under the EU's new Digital Services Act, if it's found to have failed to comply with that law.\n\nIt was in this context that TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew flew last week to Brussels. The head of the social media outlet was on a charm offensive, trying to assuage concerns, but high-level European policy chiefs sent him home with stark warnings.\n\n\"I count on TikTok to fully execute its commitments to go the extra mile in respecting EU law and regaining trust of European regulators. There cannot be any doubt that data of users in Europe are safe and not exposed to illegal access from third-country authorities,\" European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 told media after the meeting.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson told CBS News that the company has a \"clear plan that we're already implementing to reassure our community that they can trust us with their data... This includes storing European user data in our data center operations in Ireland, starting this year; further reducing employee access to data; and minimizing data flows outside of Europe.\"\n\n\"Europe must finally wake up\"\n\nTiktok's relationship with the Chinese government is complex. The platform's parent company ByteDance is based in Beijing, and while the company has denied sharing data with Chinese authorities, TikTok admitted in a policy update last November that Chinese employees could be granted \"remote access\" to European user data.\n\nThat admission sparked fears that the Chinese government could legally force ByteDance to hand over any user data to which the company has access. Given that China's ruling Communist Party has complete control over all business conducted on the country's soil \u2014 with no checks or balances on that power, it's not a far-fetched concern.\n\nByteDance collects a sizable amount of data through TikTok and other digital properties. According to the company's own privacy policy, TikTok collects the names of users, passwords, phone numbers, private messages on the app, the mobile networks used by its users, their contacts, satellite location information, and payment details such as credit card info.\n\nAnd TikTok is growing fast. As of June 2022, there were 227.81 million users in Europe. To put that in context, there were fewer than 100 million Twitter users in Europe as of 2022, according to DataReportal.\n\nK\u00f6rner believes it's high time for European lawmakers to reign in the video sharing app by simply enforcing existing laws.\n\n\"TikTok's success is the result of a European policy failure,\" he told CBS News. \"Europe must finally wake up\u2026 If TikTok refuses to abide by EU laws, it should be banned.\"",

            "text": "The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on Thursday imposed fresh fines of \u20ac5.5 million against Meta's WhatsApp for violating data protection laws when processing users' personal information.\n\nAt the heart of the ruling is an update to the messaging platform's Terms of Service that was imposed in the days leading to the enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, requiring that users agree to the revised terms in order to continue using the service or risk losing access.\n\nThe complaint, filed by privacy non-profit NOYB, alleged that WhatsApp breached the regulation by compelling its users to \"consent to the processing of their personal data for service improvement and security\" by \"making the accessibility of its services conditional on users accepting the updated Terms of Service.\"\n\n\"WhatsApp Ireland is not entitled to rely on the contract legal basis for the delivery of service improvement and security,\" the DPC said in a statement, adding the data collected so far amounts to a contravention of GDPR.\n\nAside from the fine, the messaging application has also been ordered to bring its operations into compliance within a period of six months. It's worth noting that Meta has its European headquarters in Dublin.\n\nThe DPC, however, noted it doesn't plan to investigate whether WhatsApp processes user metadata for advertising, calling it \"open-ended and speculative.\" NOYB, in a response, criticized the authority for declining to act on it.\n\n\"WhatsApp says it's encrypted, but this is only true for the content of chats \u2013 not the metadata,\" NOYB's Max Schrems said. \"WhatsApp still knows who you chat with most and at what time. This allows Meta to get a very close understanding of the social fabric around you.\"\n\n\"Meta uses this information to, for example, target ads that friends were already interested in,\" Schrems further added. It seems the DPC has now simply refused to decide on this matter, despite 4.5 years of investigations.\"\n\nWhatsApp notably received blowback in early 2021, when it announced a similar update to its privacy policy that required users to accept the changes to continue using the service, prompting the European Commission to issue a warning, urging the company to \"clearly inform\" consumers of its business model.\n\n\"In particular, WhatsApp is encouraged to show how it plans to communicate any future updates to its terms of service, and to do so in a way that consumers can easily understand the implications of such updates and freely decide they want to continue using WhatsApp after these updates,\" the Commission said in June 2022.\n\nOn top of that, WhatsApp has previously attracted scrutiny for taking a U-turn on its data sharing practices with parent company Meta (then Facebook) for ad targeting. In 2017, the E.U. fined the social media giant \u20ac110 million for \"providing incorrect or misleading information\" during its probe into the merger following the acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014.\n\nThe latest penalty comes two weeks after the DPC fined Meta \u20ac390 million over its handling of user data for serving personalized ads in Facebook and Instagram, giving the company three months to find a valid legal basis for processing personal data for behavioral advertising.\n\nNOYB, for its part, has written to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), stating that the watchdog \"turned a blind eye on the revenue generated from violating the GDPR when calculating its fine,\" and that \"the DPC's maneuver saved Meta almost \u20ac4 billion.\"",

            "text": "\u201cWhat we are seeing today with the metaverse is the evolution of how we are going to be connected to networks, digital environments, and potentially the internet,\u201d Chalico told Insurance Business.\n\nWhat types of technology are being used in the metaverse?\n\nThere are at least four different types of technology converging in the metaverse, according to Chalico:\n\nInterfaces \u2013 also called \u201cspatial computing,\u201d these include the devices people use to connect to the internet or any other network, such as Meta\u2019s Oculus Quest headset. Game engines \u2013 these engines underpin the metaverse as digital representations or avatars that engage and interact in virtual environments. Digital environments \u2013 augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) create the immersive experiences users would not find in the physical world. Virtual economies \u2013 the blockchain, digital currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enable commercial transactions to occur in virtual spaces.\n\nThe metaverse creates different opportunities for companies to interact meaningfully with customers, collaborate with teams, and differentiate themselves in competitive markets. Through this new reality, customers can be transported to a retail store to browse the latest products; workers to a pipeline facility to be trained how to repair it; or pilots to a plane cockpit for flight simulations.\n\nHowever, the metaverse also opens businesses up to a variety of exposures, especially if they go in without a robust cybersecurity and data privacy plan.\n\nWhat are the risks associated with the metaverse?\n\nThe most significant risks associated with the metaverse are cyberattacks and data and privacy breaches. This is because virtual reality platforms collect a lot of personal information.\n\n\u201cThe more accurate a digital representation or avatar is, the more personal information will be collected. An avatar can represent the gestures you make, the shape of your body, the color of your hair, skin, and eyes\u2026 all those elements are personal information that in many cases can be biometric and needs to be very well protected,\u201d Chalico said.\n\n\u201cAnd if in addition to that, we are going to be performing commercial transactions in the metaverse, all of that financial data needs to be protected as well.\u201d\n\nCustomers need to be able to consent before their data in the metaverse can be collected and shared for other purposes, like how they can consent to apps or websites they sign up for. Companies must create adequate controls for data privacy or face liabilities.\n\nBad actors can launch cyberattacks through vulnerable AR and VR devices, which store a huge amount of user data. Similarly, hackers can easily spoof metaverse users\u2019 identities or steal and take over accounts. Cybersecurity for the metaverse can be uniquely challenging and require specialized expertise.\n\nFinally, there are also physical risks associated with the metaverse. \u201cThe metaverse can be incredibly immersive, and users could be completely unaware of their physical space while they are having a metaverse experience,\u201d Chalico said. \u201cOrganizations need to consider the risks to provide users with solid recommendations to have a physically safe experience when using the metaverse.\u201d\n\nHow can companies avoid data and cybersecurity risks in the metaverse?\n\nTo combat these exposures, organizations should \u201cground [their] metaverse strategy in a holistic, privacy-by-design and cybersecurity-by-design approach,\u201d according to Chalico.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we tend to be focused first on making technology operational, delivering the value that is expected. Only later do we think of cybersecurity and privacy controls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that needs to change now that the metaverse is a reality.\u201d\n\nAd hoc risk mitigation won\u2019t be enough for companies that want to take part in the metaverse.\n\n\n\n\u201cPrivacy by design,\u201d an approach developed by Ontario\u2019s former information and privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian, calls for data privacy to be considered during the entire systems engineering process.\n\n\u201cThe concept is about finding privacy controls before a new system or a new process is embedded into the production environment,\u201d said Chalico.\n\nPrivacy-by-design and cybersecurity-by-design are strategies that businesses can use to create an environment of trust with customers and other stakeholders. These plans should also include a code of conduct and ethical principles that will guide the organization\u2019s use of metaverse applications.\n\nChalico emphasized that the right players are needed to guide business leaders and help them create a strategy to navigate the complex risks in the metaverse. \u201cYou need to bring in privacy and cybersecurity specialists from the very beginning, before the applications and processes are designed,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat risks in the metaverse should be the most concerning for insureds?

The carrier has been hit by two huge breaches in 15 months, but the addition of at least six other security incidents during the last five years indicates a misalignment between security investments and outcomes.\n\n\u201cTo be hacked twice in the span of a bit over a year is pretty egregious,\u201d Mauricio Sanchez, research director of network security at Dell\u2019Oro Group, said via email. \u201cOne would think that after the string of hacks and the significant penalty it would have led T-Mobile to up their game, but it\u2019s pretty evident it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nT-Mobile declined a request for further comment.\n\nBreaches beget breaches\n\nThe latest incident marks T-Mobile\u2019s eighth publicly acknowledged data breach since 2018. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need to know about their lack of urgency around this,\u201d said Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research.\n\n\u201cClearly they are behind the other carriers and this becomes a cyclical problem,\u201d Kerravala said. \u201cSince they appear to be easier to breach, hackers will focus on them, causing more breaches.\u201d\n\nThe gap between the threat actor\u2019s initial intrusion and T-Mobile\u2019s detection can be attributed to multiple unresolved challenges for the mobile network operator, according to multiple analysts.\n\n\u201cIt does point to some severe failings, in particular after the many promises to do better after the last sequence of attacks,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s lack of visibility into malicious activity is \u201cthe biggest issue,\u201d Kerravala said.\n\n\u201cBreaches happen, everyone knows that,\" he said.\" But a company like T-Mobile, whose entire business is wrapped up in its networks, should be able to see anomalous traffic that could indicate a breach in almost real time.\u201d\n\nIntrusion underscores common API security challenges\n\nT-Mobile hasn\u2019t shared details about the API exploited by the threat actor, but it\u2019s important to know what purpose it served, where it was exposed, and why it had access to customers\u2019 PII.\n\n\u201cNo API is perfect and problems relating to API credential management are extremely common these days,\u201d Justin Fier, SVP of red team operations at Darktrace, said via email.\n\n\u201cWhile it is unclear what the API in the T-Mobile attack was used for it would be alarming for an external API to have access to this amount of sensitive PII,\u201d Fier said.\n\nThe attack scenarios most commonly associated with API data breaches, according to the Open Web Application Security Project, include:\n\nBroken access control\n\nInsecure design\n\nSecurity misconfiguration\n\nIdentity and authentication failures\n\nLogging and monitoring failures\n\nMismatched priorities endanger enterprises\n\nThe predominant challenge confronting organizations isn\u2019t so much an inability to take security seriously.\n\n\u201cThe problem is security is not the primary focus for these companies, but it is the primary focus for the attackers,\u201d said Chris Nicoll, senior principal analyst at Nicoll Associates.\n\n\u201c[Threat actors] spend their full time designing and adapting their attacks. That is not to say that companies, such at T-Mobile, should be off the hook when an attack does occur,\u201d he said.\n\nMalicious actors are \u201cmasterful at hiding their activities,\u201d and it\u2019s incumbent on T-Mobile to be more diligent at monitoring and managing its systems, Nicoll said.\n\nShort of a financial penalty and potential regulatory actions, the setbacks to T-Mobile, following this latest incident, will be minimal, analysts tell Cybersecurity Dive.\n\nFatigue and abstract concepts typically applied to security breaches might also diminish the fallout for T-Mobile.\n\nBut T-Mobile customers should be wary, Kerravala said. \u201cIn a world that is becoming rapidly digitized, the mobile phone is now the control point of our lives. If you can\u2019t trust your mobile operator, that\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d",

            "text": "Walmart has launched a concerted effort to share more about its extensive cybersecurity strategy as it continues to evolve from a big-box retailer to a big-tech competitor.\n\nDriving the news: The retail giant hosted its first-ever cybersecurity media day with six reporters earlier this week at its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters.\n\nThe daylong event included its first-ever public tour of an on-site data center, a demonstration of the security teams' ransomware responses, and a handful of panel discussions and roundtables with senior executives.\n\nWhy it matters: Walmart, like other big retailers, has historically been hesitant to share much about its cybersecurity program beyond the occasional one-off executive interview or conference panel participation for fear of malicious hackers learning too much about its systems.\n\nBut by sharing the details of its security program, Walmart now hopes to build customer trust in all of its offerings \u2014 retail and beyond.\n\nThe big picture: Jerry Geisler, Walmart's global chief information security officer, told Axios that this week's event is just the start of the company's efforts to pull back the curtain on his team's wide-reaching efforts.\n\n\"We landed on this realization that, like many companies, we don't talk a lot about this,\" Geisler said during a brief interview. \"We think we're at a point where we want to start telling that story.\"\n\nGeisler sees sharing this story as integral to Walmart's mission of building customer trust: If people know how much Walmart pours into securing their personal information, then privacy-minded consumers will keep buying from Walmart.\n\nBetween the lines: Cybersecurity at Walmart goes far beyond its brick-and-mortar locations and e-commerce activities.\n\nWalmart has actively expanded into telemedicine and pharmaceutical services, as well as into digital payments through its Walmart Pay app.\n\nCatch up quick: Walmart has had an information security team for more than two decades, Geisler said, giving the company an advantage in embedding the security team throughout the company's other divisions, including legal and product design.\n\n\"You don't see many companies building information security programs in the late '90s,\" he added.\n\nZoom out: As consumers demand more information about the ways their data is collected, stored and protected, more companies are starting to build up their cybersecurity and privacy reputations.\n\nA prime example is Apple, which has carved out a reputation as a privacy-minded technology company as it expands beyond devices and into services.\n\nDetails: Walmart has security workers in Bentonville, the D.C. area, the Bay Area and Bengaluru, India. Soon, it'll have even more at new hubs in Atlanta, Seattle and Toronto.\n\nThe company has lawyers who have developed quantifiable risk analysis scores to help communicate to nonsecurity leaders how much of a threat a new vulnerability is for the company specifically.\n\nWalmart conducts a quarterly audit of which files current employees have access to, and it is currently studying ways to transition to a full zero-trust plan and to ditch passwords altogether, Melissa Yandell, senior director of Walmart's identity and access management team, told Axios.\n\nThe intrigue: Much of Walmart's security operations are in-house, although it still works with some vendors on various detection efforts.\n\nThe company has its own incident response and threat intelligence teams, as well as its own in-house, accredited forensics labs for hardware and data-recovery efforts. Most companies would defer at least one of these to a third-party contractor.\n\nYes, but: Building out this much in-house cybersecurity tooling doesn't make sense for every company. Not everyone ranks first in the Fortune 500 and has the same resources.\n\nWhat's next: Geisler said he expects the next phase of Walmart's cyber blitz to focus on consumer education.\n\nWhile the precise details are still being hashed out, Walmart already puts together tips on the cybersecurity page of its website.\n\nSign up for Axios\u2019 cybersecurity newsletter Codebook here.",

            "text": "[author: Jaclyn Jaeger]\n\nLast year was a busy one for data privacy legislation across the United States, and with many states\u2019 consumer data privacy laws in effect this year, now is the time to reassess where more changes may be needed in order to prepare.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), \u201cat least 35 states and the District of Columbia introduced or considered almost 200 consumer privacy bills in 2022.\u201d Comprehensive (omnibus) privacy legislation was the most common type of bill considered, introduced in at 25 least states and the District of Columbia and in almost 70 bills, according to the NCSL.\n\nComprehensive privacy legislation, as defined by the NCSL, broadly refers to the regulation of the \u201ccollection, use, and disclosure of personal information and providing an express set of consumer rights with regard to collected data \u2013 such as the right to access, correct, and delete personal information\u201d collected by businesses (data controllers).\n\nTo date, five states passed the following comprehensive privacy legislation:\n\nBy design, these comprehensive consumer privacy laws have many similarities from a big-picture perspective, but they also have a patchwork of subtle differences that companies will need to iron out.\n\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of some of those consumer privacy provisions and a brief overview of the similarities and differences between each state\u2019s requirements.\n\nScope of coverage: Among the five states\u2019 consumer privacy laws, Utah takes the most business-friendly approach, overall. Like other states, the UCPA applies to any business or data processor who does business in the state or produces a product or service targeted to consumers who are residents of that state.\n\nThe scope of the UCPA, however, covers only businesses or data processors that also:\n\nHave annual revenue of $25 million or more; and\n\nSatisfies one or more of the following thresholds: during a calendar year, controls or processes personal data of 100,000 or more consumers; or derives over 50% of the entity\u2019s gross revenue from the sale of personal data and controls or processes personal data of 25,000 or more consumers.\n\nVirginia, Colorado, and Connecticut establish similar 100,000/25,000 consumer thresholds, with some variance regarding the \u201cgross revenue from the sale of personal data\u201d threshold. What makes Utah\u2019s multi-tier threshold more business-friendly, however, is that it ensures not only that smaller companies will not be subject to the UCPA, but also that even companies that satisfy the $25 million annual revenue threshold will not fall under the law, unless they also satisfy at least one of the other listed thresholds.\n\nOther than Utah, California is the only other state to include a revenue threshold ($25 million in annual global revenue). Unlike the UCPA, however, the CPRA states that a business that does not make $25 million in annual global revenue can still fall under the scope of the CPRA, so long as it meets one of these other two thresholds: buys, sells, or shares the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents or households; or derives 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling or sharing California residents\u2019 personal information.\n\n\u201cConsumer\u201d defined: Subtle differences also exist between how each state defines \u201cconsumer.\u201d Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah define a \u201cconsumer\u201d as an individual who is a resident of the state acting only in an \u201cindividual or household context.\u201d The CPRA, in contrast, goes further by additionally including individuals acting in a \u201ccommercial or employment context.\u201d\n\n\u201cSale of personal data\u201d defined: Under the various state consumer privacy laws, the \u201csale\u201d of personal information triggers many of the requirements, and so understanding the definition of each state law is important. Virginia and Utah define \u201csale\u201d as the exchange of personal data \u201cfor monetary consideration by a controller to a third party.\u201d Cookie data for targeted advertising purposes, for example, may not apply. In contrast, California, Colorado, and Connecticut define \u201csale\u201d more broadly as including \u201cmonetary or other valuable considerations.\u201d\n\nPersonal data defined: Utah, Virginia, Connecticut, and Colorado define \u201cpersonal data\u201d broadly as any information that is \u201clinked or reasonably linkable to an identifiable or identified individual.\u201d Among these states, personal data does not include de-identified or publicly available information.\n\nScope of exemptions: The scope of exemptions is broad, and in some states more than others. All five states provide exemptions for government agencies, and \u2013 except for Colorado \u2013 exempt non-profit organizations. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah also provide exemptions for institutions of higher education, financial institutions subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and \u2013 again, except for Colorado \u2013 covered businesses or business associates regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\nIn addition to the type of entities subject to exemptions, exemptions are provided for certain types of data covered by other federal laws. These exemptions vary by state but generally include, for example, the GLBA and HIPAA.\n\nPrivacy notices: As companies revise their privacy notices, or create new ones, keep in mind that some states\u2019 consumer privacy laws \u2013 like Connecticut and Utah \u2013 require businesses provide a \u201creasonably accessible, clear and meaningful\u201d privacy notice. Moreover, the privacy notice must include:\n\nThe categories of personal data that are collected or processed by the businesses\n\nThe purposes for processing the data\n\nHow consumers may exercise their rights, and\n\nThe categories of personal data that\u2019s shared with third parties, if any\n\nSome states\u2013 for example, Connecticut and Utah \u2013 further require that where the business \u201csells\u201d consumer data to a third party or processes it for targeted advertising, the privacy notice must \u201cclearly and conspicuously\u201d disclose how consumers can exercise their opt-out rights may opt out of such activities.\n\nUniversal opt-out mechanisms: California, Colorado and Connecticut each require businesses to recognize universal opt-out mechanisms (GPC signals), which gives consumers the ability to opt-out of the processing of their personal data across multiple websites simultaneously, rather than having to make individual opt-out requests through each website. Virginia does not include such a requirement. Each state also has varying requirements regarding consumer opt-out rights pertaining to the collection of \u201csensitive\u201d data, as defined by each state, which must also be considered.\n\nThe effective date to get into compliance varies by state. Under Connecticut\u2019s privacy law, for example, universal opt-out mechanisms must be recognized by controllers as valid consumer requests beginning Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nService provider agreements: Also important from a legal and compliance standpoint, all five states require businesses to impose contractual obligations on data processors with whom they share consumer data. Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia go beyond California by requiring businesses to provide clear instructions pertaining to the processing of personal data; the nature and purpose of the processing; the type of data to be processed; the duration of the processing; and the rights and obligations of the parties.\n\nData protection assessments: Among the five states, Utah is the only one that does not require businesses to conduct and document a data protection assessment regarding processing activities involving personal data. The scope and level of detail required by each data protection assessment varies greatly by state.\n\nCompliance takeaways\n\nThe provisions mentioned above provide only a high-level overview of just a few of each state\u2019s key requirements. Using the CPRA as a benchmark when reviewing the company\u2019s privacy compliance program, it will be important moving forward to regroup as a cross-functional team and assess where further changes may be needed, depending in which states the business operates, and where its consumers reside.\n\nAs a fundamental first step, prudent companies will want to conduct a data mapping exercise that, at a minimum, provides clarity around what personal information the business collects, and how that data is stored, shared and used.\n\nEnsuring compliance with each state\u2019s patchwork of consumer privacy laws also requires reviewing and, where necessary, amending privacy notices and ensuring they\u2019re easily accessible to consumers, as well as reviewing the company\u2019s data retention practices, contracts with third parties, and conducting and documenting a data protection assessment.\n\nThe technology-related hurdles are also immense and demand involvement of IT, data security, and cybersecurity experts to ensure do-not-sell/share links are functioning properly, GPC signals are being recognized, and that the business has robust cybersecurity practices in place. For some companies, this is going to be a lot more resource-intensive of an undertaking than for others.\n\nKeeping on top of developments in each state as new guidance becomes available and/or as state rules are revised is important as well. On Dec. 21, 2022, the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s office, for example, published revised rules to its consumer privacy act, which make further changes to the draft rules it published in September.\n\nIn short, absent a comprehensive federal consumer privacy law, businesses will have to continue reviewing their data privacy compliance obligations state-by-state, and day-by-day.\n\nView GRC Solutions by Regulation\n\nView original article at Risk & Compliance Matters",

            "text": "Twitter finally broke its silence over the first security incident of the Musk era: an alleged data breach that exposed the contact information of millions of users.\n\nIn late December, a poster on a popular cybercrime forum claimed to have scraped the email addresses and phone numbers of 400 million Twitter users by way of a zero-day security flaw in Twitter\u2019s systems, previously blamed for exposing at least 5 million Twitter accounts before it was fixed in January 2022. The subsequent sale of another, smaller dataset containing the email addresses associated with more than 235 million Twitter accounts is said to be a cleaned-up version of the alleged dataset of 400 million Twitter users. Researchers warned that the email addresses, which included the details of politicians, journalists and public figures, could be used to dox pseudonymous accounts.\n\nTwitter, or what\u2019s left of the company, addressed the situation last week.\n\nIn an unattributed blog post, Twitter said it had conducted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d and found \u201cno evidence\u201d that the data sold online was obtained by exploiting a vulnerability of Twitter\u2019s systems. An absence of evidence, however, is not vindication, as it\u2019s unclear if Twitter has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if any user data was exfiltrated. Rather, the company said that hackers had likely been circulating a collection of data pulled from past breaches and said the data did not correlate to any of the data obtained by way of exploiting the bug that was fixed in January 2022.\n\nWhat Twitter is saying may very well be true, but it\u2019s difficult to have confidence in the company\u2019s statement. Twitter\u2019s erratic response raises many of the same questions that regulators will want to know: Who was tasked with investigating this breach, and does Twitter have the resources to do a thorough job?\n\nAn important lesson in what not to do",
