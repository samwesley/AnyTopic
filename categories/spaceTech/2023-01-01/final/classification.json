Photo Credit: Staff Sgt. D. Myles Cullen (USAF) By\nObserver Research Foundation  By Kalpit A Mankikar and Kartik Bommakanti The Chinese defence industry has made rapid advances in the recent past. Data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIRPI) for the year 2021 indicates that Chinese defence companies were at the forefront of defence sales in the Asia-Oceania region.  Although the United States\u2019 defence industry sits at the apex of the world\u2019s major weapons manufacturers, the Chinese have significantly expanded their footprint in the Asia-Oceania region accounting for over 80 percent of all weapons sales from the region. What accounts for the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019 (PRC) defence industry gains in weapons sales and dynamism? The PRC\u2019s rise as a significant defence industrial actor on the global stage owes to systematic and relentless investments since its inception as a communist state in 1949. The most crucial variable that explains the robustness of today\u2019s PRC\u2019s defence-industrial base is the Peoples Liberation Army\u2019 (PLA) and its senior leadership\u2019s sustained commitment and patronage of the Chinese defence industry. Virtually, the entirety of China\u2019s major defence industries ranging from space technology to electronics to shipbuilding and synthetic chemicals have come from PLA contractual support to these industries. The penetration of the Chinese military into the country\u2019s economy at the institutional, organisational and ideological level occurred during the most perilous phase of China\u2019s external threat environment between the years 1950 and 1969.  The PLA\u2019s influence at the level of policy, ideology, organisation and process continued into the Reform era starting in 1978. The distinctive features of the PRC\u2019s innovative organisational strategy towards national security involved an absolute commitment to self-reliance, despite periodic purchases from abroad and co-production. The defence industry has successfully blended institutions that combined Stalinist top-down mobilisation of resources with an incentive structure that mimics the Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurship characterised by risk-taking, individual incentives, initiative and networks of cooperation among technical experts.  Notwithstanding setbacks to broader reform under Xi Jinping, China\u2019s defence industrial base has not suffered any tangible or visible damage. Consequently, the Chinese defence industry has thrived and the latest SIPRI report bears this out in the form of large arms sales for the year 2021. A cursory look at Chart 1 will illustrate why the Chinese defence industry has thrived despite the COVID-19 pandemic and all the supply chain issues that have adversely affected the defence industries of other countries.  China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) saw a surge in sales by 11 percent in 2021 as opposed to 2020, whereas the second-ranked company Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) saw a rise by 9 percent in sales from 2020 to 2021. The third major company to make a gain of 4.2 percent in 2021 in contrast to 2020 was China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) saw a jump in sales by 13 percent from 2020 to 2021.  Only China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), albeit by the measure of total sales exceeded CASC and CASIC and which builds Information Technologies and Electronics experienced a fall by 5.6 percent, but then supply-chain disruptions in these technological sectors were among the worst hit worldwide as a result of the pandemic. Despite the rapid advances made by the PRC\u2019s defence industry\u2014there are three core areas where the Chinese still face challenges: very advanced electronics, submarine quieting technology and shipbuilding technology in the area of propulsion which involves precision engineering.  Although China\u2019s development of conventional submarines is moving from Air-independent propulsion systems to lithium-ion batteries. In due course, Russian assistance in submarine quieting technology will help Beijing reduce the gap with more advanced naval powers such as the US. The Chinese have also made considerable investments in space, cyber, electronic warfare, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum technology.  Indeed, the advances made by the Chinese in indigenous defence capabilities and several emerging technologies has precipitated to a large extent the US\u2019 \u201cThird-offset\u201d strategy win a quest to maintain technological superiority over its rivals in specific technology fields such as AI, cyber capabilities, unmanned systems, and machine learning. The Creating Helpful Industries to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (CHIPS Act) passed by the United States Congress recently is a US$ 53-billion law geared to subsidising and assisting the American semi-conductor industry from Chinese competition. It bars American companies that are beneficiaries\u2019 of subsidies under the Act from investing in China\u2019s semi-conductor industry in a quest to \u201ccatalyse\u201d advance Research and Development (R&D) within the US. Most importantly, semi-conductors are a vital component in key weapons extending from missiles to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automotive parts and China\u2019s tension with world\u2019s largest manufacturer of semi-conductor.  To be sure, semi-conductors and submarine propulsion are high-end technologies. However, the success of the Chinese defence industry is instructive\u2014by adopting a \u201cgood enough development model\u201d that is absorption based keeping costs low and acquiring capabilities at a rapid clip, the Chinese have managed carry out a vast amount of indigenisation making them a fairly effective seller of defence products to the Chinese armed services and a competitive defence exporter, but Beijing faces a serious challenge in migrating from an absorption-based development model to an innovation-based development that involves more cutting edge weapons development.  The latter will test the Chinese defence industry\u2019s capacity to keep costs low even as innovation is advanced to meet the acquisition requirements of the Chinese armed services. At least between 2016-2020, the PRC\u2019s primary defence export destinations were Pakistan, Bangladesh and Algeria, which respectively imported 38 percent, 17 percent and 8.2 percent of defence systems. Apart from the aforementioned countries, in 2011, the Chinese started exporting combat or armed Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Uzbekistan.  Armed UAVs were until that point only being used by the US, Israel, and Britain and the only country the US exported UAVs were to France. It is also indicative of the distance the PRC has traversed transitioning from a major importer of weapons to now a major defence exporter. It seems that the PRC has realised that the trade in weapons can serve several Chinese foreign policy and economic objectives. Take the case of Africa, which is rich in hydrocarbons and minerals that are a draw for China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest after the US. The continent is also important to China, given that Xi\u2019s \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 initiative aims at connecting Beijing to Africa and Europe through a network of ports, railway lines, power stations and special economic zones. Here, China seeks to bind itself to other one-party states in Africa and makes common cause with them through antipathy with the West.  Ahead of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in November 2021, Xi\u2019s address harped on the need to \u201coppose intervention in domestic affairs, racial discrimination and unilateral sanctions \u2026 and translate our common aspirations and interests into joint actions\u201d, alluding to the West that has on several occasions pulled up African governments for violations of human rights. On the pretext of training and upgradation programmes meant for the civil service through initiatives like the \u2018China-Africa Action Plan\u2019, China increased the intake of defence personnel.  In 2018, China hosted senior military officials from 50 African nations at the China-Africa defence forum, with an aim of expanding its influence among the defence brass. While this is a more formal arrangement, ties with senior military figures in Africa have kept China ahead of the geopolitical curve and manage any fallout of leadership transitions in volatile African nations.  For example, the chief of Zimbabwe\u2019s armed forces, General Constantino Chiwenga, was in China and met senior leaders three days before Robert Mugabe, one of Africa\u2019s longest serving leaders was deposed in 2017, sparking speculation as to whether or not Beijing was in the know about the coup. The PRC has been very effective at co-opting, especially senior defence personnel in the developing world. Militaries form the backbone of several developing countries and nominally civilian leaders do require their support. Consequently, the Chinese industry has readily available defence export markets. Any industry needs a market to bring in revenues and a testing ground to improvise its product. As China\u2019s arms industry thrives, its dynamics with Africa will be interesting. Both have a great deal to offer each other. A resource-starved China eyes Africa to power its economy, whereas African nations that thrive on the extractive-industry economy, but deprive its citizenry of public services will increasingly look to acquiring instruments of hard power to bolster their regime.

The discovery marks the beginning of a new era of investigating how stars like our Sun form, and how the radiation from nearby massive stars might affect the development of planets. The Cosmic Cliffs, a region at the edge of a gigantic, gaseous cavity within the star cluster NGC 3324, has long intrigued astronomers as a hotbed for star formation. While well-studied by the Hubble Space Telescope, many details of star formation in NGC 3324 remain hidden at visible-light wavelengths. Webb is perfectly primed to tease out these long-sought-after details since it is built to detect jets and outflows seen only in the infrared at high resolution. Webb\u2019s capabilities also allow researchers to track the movement of other features previously captured by Hubble. Recently, by analyzing data from a specific wavelength of infrared light (4.7 microns), astronomers discovered two dozen previously unknown outflows from extremely young stars revealed by molecular hydrogen. Webb\u2019s observations uncovered a gallery of objects ranging from small fountains to burbling behemoths that extend light-years from the forming stars. Many of these protostars are poised to become low mass stars, like our Sun. \u201cWhat Webb gives us is a snapshot in time to see just how much star formation is going on in what may be a more typical corner of the universe that we haven\u2019t been able to see before,\u201d said astronomer Megan Reiter of Rice University in Houston, Texas, who led the study. Molecular hydrogen is a vital ingredient for making new stars and an excellent tracer of the early stages of their formation. As young stars gather material from the gas and dust that surround them, most also eject a fraction of that material back out again from their polar regions in jets and outflows. These jets then act like a snowplow, bulldozing into the surrounding environment. Visible in Webb\u2019s observations is the molecular hydrogen getting swept up and excited by these jets. \u201cJets like these are signposts for the most exciting part of the star formation process. We only see them during a brief window of time when the protostar is actively accreting,\u201d explained co-author Nathan Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Previous observations of jets and outflows looked mostly at nearby regions and more evolved objects that are already detectable in the visual wavelengths seen by Hubble.

While well-studied by the Hubble Space Telescope, many details of star formation in NGC 3324 remain hidden at visible-light wavelengths. Webb is perfectly primed to tease out these long-sought-after details since it is built to detect jets and outflows seen only in the infrared at high resolution. Webb\u2019s capabilities also allow researchers to track the movement of other features previously captured by Hubble.\nRecently, by analyzing data from a specific wavelength of infrared light (4.7 microns), astronomers discovered two dozen previously unknown outflows from extremely young stars revealed by molecular hydrogen. Webb\u2019s observations uncovered a gallery of objects ranging from small fountains to burbling behemoths that extend light-years from the forming stars. Many of these protostars are poised to become low mass stars, like our Sun.\n\u201cWhat Webb gives us is a snapshot in time to see just how much star formation is going on in what may be a more typical corner of the universe that we haven\u2019t been able to see before,\u201d said astronomer Megan Reiter of Rice University in Houston, Texas, who led the study.\nMolecular hydrogen is a vital ingredient for making new stars and an excellent tracer of the early stages of their formation. As young stars gather material from the gas and dust that surround them, most also eject a fraction of that material back out again from their polar regions in jets and outflows. These jets then act like a snowplow, bulldozing into the surrounding environment. Visible in Webb\u2019s observations is the molecular hydrogen getting swept up and excited by these jets.\n\u201cJets like these are signposts for the most exciting part of the star formation process. We only see them during a brief window of time when the protostar is actively accreting,\u201d explained co-author Nathan Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson.\nPrevious observations of jets and outflows looked mostly at nearby regions and more evolved objects that are already detectable in the visual wavelengths seen by Hubble. The unparalleled sensitivity of Webb allows observations of more distant regions, while its infrared optimization probes into the dust-sampling younger stages. Together this provides astronomers with an unprecedented view into environments that resemble the birthplace of our solar system.\n\u201cIt opens the door for what\u2019s going to be possible in terms of looking at these populations of newborn stars in fairly typical environments of the universe that have been invisible up until the James Webb Space Telescope,\u201d added Reiter. \u201cNow we know where to look next to explore what variables are important for the formation of Sun-like stars.\u201d\nThis period of very early star formation is especially difficult to capture because, for each individual star, it\u2019s a relatively fleeting event \u2013 just a few thousand to 10,000 years amid a multi-million-year process of star formation.\n\u201cIn the image first released in July, you see hints of this activity, but these jets are only visible when you embark on that deep dive \u2013 dissecting data from each of the different filters and analyzing each area alone,\u201d shared team member Jon Morse of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \u201cIt\u2019s like finding buried treasure.\u201d\nIn analyzing the new Webb observations, astronomers are also gaining insights into how active these star-forming regions are, even in a relatively short time span.

Today, we look back at some of the agency\u2019s biggest developments in the past year. DART mission crashes spacecraft into asteroid NASA announced in October that its experiment to crash a spacecraft into an asteroid had successfully changed the path of the orbiting object. Officials said it was the first time in history that a human action had changed the motion of a space object. NASA\u2019s DART spacecraft crashed in September into an asteroid called Dimorphos about 11 million kilometers from Earth. Dimorphos is a small \u201cmoonlet\u201d that orbits a larger asteroid named Didymos. The goal of the crash was to see how it might redirect the asteroid\u2019s path and speed. The crash reduced the object\u2019s orbital period by 32 minutes. NASA scientists had predicted a reduction of 10 minutes. So, they were pleased with the test results. NASA described the crash as the world\u2019s first planetary defense test. The targeted asteroid did not present an actual threat to Earth. Webb Space Telescope releases first images In July, NASA began releasing the first images captured by its James Webb Space Telescope. Officials described the Webb as \u201cthe largest and most powerful\u201d science telescope ever built. The orbiting observatory is a large infrared telescope that builds on the work of earlier telescopes, such as the Hubble and Spitzer. But the Webb is designed to gather more data and explore parts of space never observed before. NASA praised the work of the Webb development team and said the telescope had begun \u201ca new era in astronomy.\u201d In November, scientists said the Webb had also identified bright, early galaxies for the first time. One of the galaxies might have formed only 350 million years after the Big Bang, the event that explains the beginning of the universe. Artemis I test mission around the moon In November, NASA launched its Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which U.S. officials have called the most powerful rocket ever built. The SLS rocket carried the Orion spacecraft, or capsule, into space. The goal was to carry out an uncrewed test mission to fly around the moon. The mission was part of the space agency\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to land Americans on the moon by the mid-2020s. During a news conference earlier this month, NASA officials said they were pleased with how Orion and its systems had performed during the mission. No major problems were reported. NASA said Orion had traveled more than 2.2 million kilometers during the test mission. The capsule parachuted into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California on December 11 and was safely recovered. The goal of Artemis I was to prepare for Artemis II, which will include astronauts. That is to be followed by Artemis III, which will aim to land astronauts on the moon\u2019s surface. If that goal is reached, it would be the first moon landing by astronauts since NASA\u2019s Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Curiosity reaches new target area on Mars After a summer trip, NASA announced in October its Curiosity explorer vehicle had reached its next exploration target on Mars. The explorer, or rover, reached an area known as Mount Sharp. The area sits within the planet\u2019s Gale Crater, which Curiosity has been exploring since landing on Mars in 2012. Mount Sharp contains a mix of rocky material and many large hills. Researchers have found past evidence that Mount Sharp contained many water systems billions of years ago. But scientists believe at some point, the Martian climate grew more extreme and caused the water to dry up. Any minerals still existing in the area might provide additional evidence of severe changes to the Martian climate. Shortly after arriving in the area, Curiosity\u2019s instruments discovered many different kinds and sizes. Among the discoveries were several different salt compounds that suggest the presence of water in the past. I\u2019m Bryan Lynn.

NASA lets you discover something new in the cosmos every day! The space agency drops a new image of some part of our fascinating universe along with a brief explanation by an astronomer. Today, on the first day of the New Year, 2023, NASA has shared the image of the largest rock in our solar system. Have you seen that small dot on the right side of the light's streak? Yes, that is the largest rock in our solar system! It is famously called Pale Blue Dot. NASA claims that it is larger than every known asteroid, moon, and comet nucleus. It is even larger than any other local rocky planet. This image was captured by NASA's technological marvel Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1990 from the outer Solar System. NASA explains the photo of the day, \u201cThis rock is so large its gravity makes it into a large ball that holds heavy gases near its surface.\u201d However, it must be noted that it used to be the largest known rock of any type until the recent discoveries of large dense planets orbiting other stars. NASA further explained, \u201cToday, this rock starts another orbit around its parent star, for roughly the 5 billionth time, spinning over 350 times during each trip. Happy Gregorian Calendar New Year to all inhabitants of this rock we call Earth. \u201d Yes, this pale blue dot, or \"The Rock\", is none other than our own planet Earth!

Originally, the Voyagers aimed to conduct closeup studies of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and the larger moons of the two planets. Now, Voyager 1 has crossed into the heliosheath and is leaving the solar system, and rising above the ecliptic plane at an angle of about 35 degrees at a rate of about 520 million kilometers which is about 320 million miles a year.

Starfield is hopefully around the corner with a release date for the first half of 2023, and excitement continues to grow among players. Set in the future some 300 years, Starfield will undoubtedly embrace core sci-fi elements in its narrative and gameplay, featuring hundreds of star systems and over a thousand planets to explore. While this opens the door for thrilling adventures, many hope Bethesda will utilize hard sci-fi for the game's mechanics. Hard science fiction generally portrays the future of space flight and travel with as much accurate consistency as possible, obeying the natural laws of physics that govern the observable universe. These elements have been featured as early as the late 19th century in classic sci-fi tales and steampunk, notably by Jules Verne, yet followed by other prolific authors. Many who have penned hard science fiction tales believe that the science of complex sci-fi stories should be instructive, educating the readers or viewers and providing entertainment. RELATED: Starfield Players Will Learn 'What Happened to Earth' and Visit a Mars Colony Out the gate, Starfield is poised to embrace the harder elements of sci-fi by denying the inclusion of flashy, futuristic alien technology. Director and executive producer of Bethesda Game Studios, Todd Howard, has repeatedly mentioned during interviews that he wanted Starfield to feel like a natural evolution to space flight as seen by the present. To that end, Howard toured SpaceX and spoke with Elon Musk to better understand current space technology's logistic and aesthetic mechanics. While the trip and conversation didn't impact Starfield's story, they inspired the design of space, planets, ships, space stations, and more. Howard has explained that he wanted the game to be grounded in gritty realism, akin to the first Alien movie, which featured a more rudimentary tug spaceship carrying ore back to Earth filled with blue-collar workers. This rendition of hard sci-fi made the experience more relatable to viewers, something that Howard hopes will be the case for players. The fact that Starfield already embraces a NASA-Punk aesthetic shows its leaning toward hard sci-fi. Building off work at SpaceX, not only will the technology be lacking in flashy futurism, but the ships and their customization will also be. So while players will get to build ships to their design, the pieces available are rooted in that natural evolution of modern technology. Furthermore, the fact that player agency is abundant and features numerous governments, factions, and corporations also show the more complex science fiction elements at play. During a video interview called Constellation Questions, based on the player's starting faction, Constellation, Howard discussed how players, originally before being cut, were able to run out of fuel in space, stranding them without a viable way to proceed. While this has been removed from the game, players' ships and grav-drive will detail how much fuel and distance they can go, and perhaps something similar will be available if and when Starfield has a survival mode added (as seen in past Bethesda games). For example, early gameplay shots and player HUDs showed the UI with a compass detailing Oxygen and CO2 levels and a meter for reading gravity. Additionally, since Starfield appears to lack sentient, alien life, a common trope of softer science fiction, it speaks to the harder elements it may embrace. This is further elaborated in Starfield's philosophical aspects, which aim to explore humanity's purpose, its future among the cosmos, and what's next after space. Starfield releases November 11, 2022, for PC and Xbox Series X/S.

Many who have penned hard science fiction tales believe that the science of complex sci-fi stories should be instructive, educating the readers or viewers and providing entertainment.\n\nRELATED: Starfield Players Will Learn 'What Happened to Earth' and Visit a Mars Colony\n\n\n Starfield's Lack of Flashy, Futuristic Alien Technology\n          \n\n\n\nOut the gate, Starfield is poised to embrace the harder elements of sci-fi by denying the inclusion of flashy, futuristic alien technology. Director and executive producer of Bethesda Game Studios, Todd Howard, has repeatedly mentioned during interviews that he wanted Starfield to feel like a natural evolution to space flight as seen by the present. To that end, Howard toured SpaceX and spoke with Elon Musk to better understand current space technology's logistic and aesthetic mechanics.\n\nWhile the trip and conversation didn't impact Starfield's story, they inspired the design of space, planets, ships, space stations, and more. Howard has explained that he wanted the game to be grounded in gritty realism, akin to the first Alien movie, which featured a more rudimentary tug spaceship carrying ore back to Earth filled with blue-collar workers. This rendition of hard sci-fi made the experience more relatable to viewers, something that Howard hopes will be the case for players.\n\n\n\n How Starfield Can Include Hard Sci-Fi in its Mechanics\n          \n\n\n\nThe fact that Starfield already embraces a NASA-Punk aesthetic shows its leaning toward hard sci-fi. Building off work at SpaceX, not only will the technology be lacking in flashy futurism, but the ships and their customization will also be. So while players will get to build ships to their design, the pieces available are rooted in that natural evolution of modern technology. Furthermore, the fact that player agency is abundant and features numerous governments, factions, and corporations also show the more complex science fiction elements at play.\n\nDuring a video interview called Constellation Questions, based on the player's starting faction, Constellation, Howard discussed how players, originally before being cut, were able to run out of fuel in space, stranding them without a viable way to proceed. While this has been removed from the game, players' ships and grav-drive will detail how much fuel and distance they can go, and perhaps something similar will be available if and when Starfield has a survival mode added (as seen in past Bethesda games).\n\nFor example, early gameplay shots and player HUDs showed the UI with a compass detailing Oxygen and CO2 levels and a meter for reading gravity. Additionally, since Starfield appears to lack sentient, alien life, a common trope of softer science fiction, it speaks to the harder elements it may embrace. This is further elaborated in Starfield's philosophical aspects, which aim to explore humanity's purpose, its future among the cosmos, and what's next after space.\n\nStarfield releases November 11, 2022, for PC and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nMORE: The Post-Starfield Era of Bethesda Already Looks Great\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n                \n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\nGR Originals\nStarfield\nBethesda\nPC\nXbox Series S\nXbox Series X\n\n \n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\nJeffrey Lutz\n                    \n(88 Articles Published)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff started seriously gaming in 2017 with Horizon Zero Dawn and has since been unable to stop.

Three missions that took place in 2022 distinguished themselves not only with their success but with their potential to improve the future. The James Webb Space Telescope actually launched in late December 2021 on an ESA Ariane 6 rocket. The telescope undertook its first test as it arrived at the Earth-Sun L2 point about a month later. The space telescope unfolded its mirror and huge sunscreen, a process that had ground controllers sweating. If anything had gone wrong, a space-borne mission such as the one that rescued the Hubble Space Telescope would not have been possible.

The James Webb Space Telescope began returning the first full-color images of the universe in July 2022. The results were spectacular.

By the end of 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope had returned images of Neptune\u2019s rings, star formations near and far, as well as the first galaxies in the dawn of the Big Bang. The space telescope promises to expand humankind\u2019s knowledge of the universe for many years to come. What will come from that knowledge is currently beyond evaluation. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 in November 2021. Ten months later, DART slammed into Dimorphos, an asteroid that circles a larger asteroid called Didymos. DART\u2019s mission was to ascertain if NASA could alter the path of an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. DART succeeded beyond expectations. NASA found that DART had altered Dimorphos\u2019 orbit around Didymos by 32 minutes, give or take two minutes. The impact also created a tail of ejected debris weighing between 2.2 million pounds and 22 million pounds. NASA acquired crucial data about how massive an impact must be to alter an asteroid\u2019s path. DART\u2019s success may well lead to the salvation of the human species. Most people know that the age of the dinosaurs ended because of an asteroid strike near the Yucatan Peninsula 66 million years ago. A similar impact could end human life. Now, NASA has demonstrated a technique that could postpone doomsday permanently. As a bonus, DART\u2019s success has inspired the development of the NEO Surveyor, a space telescope dedicated to locating and characterizing near-Earth objects, some of which may threaten the Earth. Artemis 1, the first mission of a spacecraft designed to take astronauts to deep space for the first time in 50 years, roared off the launch pad in the early morning hours of Nov. 16, 2022. Over budget and behind schedule, NASA\u2019s heavy-lift Space Launch System hurtled an Orion space capsule in a distant retrograde orbit around the moon on a 26-day mission. The Orion contained mannikins festooned with sensors designed to measure the radiation environment that real astronauts would experience in a similar deep space voyage. The mission tested nearly all of the systems that would need to work on a crewed expedition. Aside from a few anomalies, Artemis 1 was a complete success. The Orion splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near Baja California. Besides the data needed to proceed with crewed missions back to the moon, Artemis 1 returned a series of images of the moon from the most distant part of its orbit with the Earth beyond. Heart-stoppingly beautiful, the images brought to mind the famous Earthrise photo taken by the crew of Apollo 8. The Artemis 1 photos provided a little well needed inspiration toward the end of a tumultuous year. The future that Artemis 1 has summoned is one in which humans are no longer confined to one planet. Humans will return to the moon, then go on to Mars and beyond to wrest knowledge, riches, and glory from the heavens. Americans seem to have had a love-hate relationship with NASA.

European scientists revived an approximately 50,000-year-old \u2018zombie virus\u2019 from a frozen lake in Russia. The world saw a rise in cases of cyclones merging to form megacyclones, courtesy warming oceans. This is known as the \u2018Fujiwhara Effect\u2019.  A 57-year-old recipient who had received a pig-to-human heart transplant in January 2022, lived for 61 days after the transplant. Doctors are slowly trying to piece together why the patient could not survive.  Scientists dug up fragments of deoxyribonucleic acid, also known as DNA, in the Scotia Sea, north of the Antarctic continent. The DNA is a million years old and makes it possible to study the responses of ocean ecosystems to climate change. A pre-existing moon likely left Saturn with its bright rings and extreme tilt, according to a new study.  Several undiscovered ant species are likely hiding in the Western Ghats, the Himalayas and North East India, according to a global ant biodiversity map. Experiments on mice showed that sound increases pain tolerance.  We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us. Together we build journalism that is independent, credible and fearless.

We have introduced Mission Karmayogi, which enables an officer to update and evaluate himself to prepare for a new assignment. It is based on a more objective approach where a bureaucrat who is transferred from one department or ministry to another is able to learn the ropes better and faster. For example, when a secretary in the health department goes to agriculture ministry, should he pretend that he understands farming overnight? There was a need to shift from a rules-based approach to a role-based approach where the bureaucrat can build himself up to his role and also evaluate himself constantly. Under this mission, there are training modules for bureaucrats focusing on imparting competencies that are critical to discharging different roles. I believe this will go a long way in making civil services fit for the future. Is the trend of IAS officers as generalists still continuing? An IAS officer may not be a specialist in too many things. Therefore, we are using the Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT) programme to find out which officer is more suitable for which assignment. This is helping us select specialists through a more transparent procedure. As you can see, officers belonging to the forest service, income tax and revenue service are holding key positions today. Even then, some specialised jobs require super specialists. We are bringing in consultants. The government has introduced lateral entry appointments to induct the best of the talent from the private sector and by routing it through the UPSC we have institutionalised the process and fixed criteria for selection following a completely merit-cum-experience based approach. An important step is that we are integrating technology with governance reforms. We have brought the expertise of seven or eight ministries and departments handling science and technology to all other ministries to see where technological interventions can take place. Science and technology experts are attending meetings of different ministries and the results have been fabulous. For example, the jal shakti ministry is now using heli-board technology to map groundwater resources. Space technology is also being used everywhere. The Svamitva programme uses drone technology to create accurate land records and has helped in comprehensive village planning to make rural India atmanirbhar. Other initiatives like soil health card and telemedicine are transforming lives. Most ministries have gone online. This shows how technology has been put to use by the Modi government, which is why even during the Covid lockdown, not a single day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work got disrupted. How are you dealing with non-performers and corrupt officers? This government is following the policy of zero tolerance for corruption. In the last eight years, 395 non-performing and corrupt Central government employees have been prematurely retired from service. It is the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prerogative to retire government servants in public interest if they are found not up to the mark. Against those who have indulged in grave misconduct, strict action is being taken, including dismissal. More than 200 requests seeking consent for a CBI probe are pending with various state governments like Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. These requests involve corruption to the tune of Rs30,912 crore. What is the prime minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision for the bureaucracy in 2047? We are slowly moving towards citizen-centric governance. Slowly the citizen will take over governance. The use of technology will facilitate this change. We are in the process of drawing indices for 2047. At that time, the scenario will be different and technology and artificial intelligence will take over in such a way that human interface will only become a facilitator. This will pose the biggest challenge to the civil services. For the bureaucrat to give his optimum performance, he must learn to use technology in the right manner. For example, in the Svamitva scheme, a farmer or land owner can access the site and find out for himself the demarcation of his land. He does not need to go through the patwari at all. So the patwari is rendered jobless. These changes are already taking place and technology is evolving very fast. It is the age of integrated working, and old systems and mindset need to change.

Reusability is the only factor that will ensure competitiveness and environmental sustainability. The Artemis I mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was recently completed successfully. Things came a full circle on 30 December, with the Orion spacecraft returning to the Kennedy Space Center.  The Artemis missions are NASA\u2019s attempts to send astronauts back to the Moon after a lapse of five decades. The recently concluded first mission carried a dummy crew member in its Orion crew capsule, which rode on top of a launcher called the Space Launch System, or SLS. The mission validated all the parameters before any actual humans are launched towards the Moon in a couple of years' time. Everything went well with the maiden mission and NASA is on track for astronauts to touch down on the lunar surface around 2025. In spite of the success of the mission, most things associated with the Artemis I mission are destroyed. The SLS itself is gone \u2014 burnt up in space. What came back and splashed into the Pacific Ocean was just the Orion crew module, which is a bell-shaped container, very small in comparison to the launch system.  The module itself is a museum piece now; it cannot be launched into space again. As we dissect the launch system and gauge the amount of waste associated with each space mission, it all leads to the conclusion that missions are very expensive and unsustainable from an environmental point of view. It is simply not scalable to support routine traffic to and from space. It is like a car getting destroyed after just one trip. To be fair, these initial missions are only discovery missions and proofs of concept. Optimality would be injected into the designs as we head into the future. As private sector participation increases further, more emphasis will be placed on reusability and cutting down costs, leading to sustainability and repeating operations on a larger scale. Let us take the example of the SLS and how it compares with the Saturn V rocket that was used for earlier human spacecraft missions to the Moon in the 1970s. The picture below, courtesy NASA, shows the two rockets side by side, along with the famed Statue of Liberty in New York City. The first stage of the SLS, represented by the orange-coloured section, houses the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks, which fuel the four RS-25 engines at the bottom. These are the same engines that powered the space shuttle of the yesteryear. To each side is a solid rocket booster, which provides additional thrust, similar to the space shuttle design. The topmost spire-like structure is the launch abort system. If, for some reason, the rocket needs to be aborted after launch, the spire along with the astronaut-carrying capsule are separated out and taken to a safe landing. The bell-shaped tiny structure below the spire is the crew capsule. Named Orion, it is designed to carry human beings to the Moon. For Artemis I, it carried a dummy human being. Just below the crew capsule is the cylindrical service module, which carries the solar arrays and communication equipment. This unit has been built by Airbus and is Europe\u2019s contribution to the mission. The crew capsule and the service module fly together as one unit to the Moon and come back to the Earth. The service module is jettisoned just before entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Wedged between the first stage and the service module top stages is the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS). It is likely to be replaced by other designs in future Artemis missions. Hence the word \"interim.\" After launch, the first stage falls off after pushing the rocket enough towards space. The ICPS pushes for some more time and then falls off. What is left is the crew capsule and service module, which travel together for most of the life of the mission. The reusability of the first stage of rockets was pioneered by a private company, SpaceX, which was started by Elon Musk. The first stage of the SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket separates and safely comes back to Earth and lands on the ground or on a ship in the ocean. After a few failures, several such refurbished first stages have been reused, thereby reducing the cost of launch. SpaceX\u2019s next venture is the Starship, which is the equivalent of NASA\u2019s SLS. This rocket will be flight-tested early 2023. It is a two-stage rocket and both of them are designed to come back safely to Earth and land. It is intended to be a fully reusable rocket and will reduce the launch costs even further. Other companies like Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin have followed suit with reusability. India has its own launch vehicles, the polar and geosynchronous satellite launch vehicles (PSLV and GSLV), which have seen a lot of launches and successful deployment of payloads. But neither of them is reusable. India\u2019s space efforts have largely been dominated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Indian government equivalent of the United States (US) government's NASA. That is changing now. Several private sector companies are now supplying components to ISRO.  More recently, a private company, Skyroot Aerospace, launched its first rocket, Vikram-S. Reusability is on the agenda for Skyroot as well as ISRO. India\u2019s launch costs are lower, largely due to cheap, skilled engineers. But India cannot bank on that factor alone for long. As the Indian economy grows, the wages will start to rise and the wage differential will begin to narrow down. Reusability is the only factor that will ensure competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Beyond reusability, it will be the efficiency of the engines and the choice of sustainable fuels that will matter a lot. Some progress is being made on this front too. SpaceX\u2019s Raptor engines are more efficient and powerful than NASA\u2019s older RS-25 engines. The greening of space is not just a philosophical nicety. It is an economic imperative too.

These missions have laid a technological foundation for the peaceful use of space.\n\nBut the most high-profile rocket launches this year were related to the construction of the Chinese space station, with two manned spaceships, two cargo craft and two 20-tonne-level lab modules sent into orbit.\n\nThe launch of the Mengtian lab module was challenging as it weighs 23 tonnes, making it the world's heaviest single-cabin active spacecraft in orbit.\n\nChina has also made advances in its manned space program. A total of nine taikonauts on three missions - Shenzhou-13, Shenzhou-14 and Shenzhou-15 - participated in the construction of the space station this year. The country also carried out its first in-orbit crew rotation, with six Chinese citizens aboard China's space station at the same time.\n\nChen Dong became the first taikonaut to remain in orbit for more than 200 days. Before returning to Earth on Dec. 4, he led the Shenzhou-14 crew to complete multiple tasks, including three spacewalks, a series of scientific experiments, a live science lecture and several in-orbit operations. The trio has been called \"the busiest space crew\" by Chinese netizens.\n\nThis year also witnessed the debut of several commercial Chinese rockets as they deployed satellites into space.\n\nChina will continue its intensive space launch schedule into next year. More Long March rockets will be tasked with missions for the operational phase of China space station.

These experiments will evaluate the performance of the human-rated launch vehicle, the orbital module propulsion system, and the recovery procedures.According to Jitendra Singh, a Union Minister of State in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, ISRO further plans to carry out the first runway landing experiment (RLV-LEX) of the reusable launch vehicle early next year from the Aeronautical Test Range in Chitradurga, Karnataka.Indian start-ups made their presence known with the first sub-orbital launch by a commercial company, Skyroot Aerospace\u2019s Vikram-S rocket, and the launches of Pixxel\u2019s hyperspectral satellites Shakuntala and Anand on SpaceX\u2019s Falcon-9 and ISRO\u2019s PSLV, respectively, in April and November.A client satellite will be launched into orbit by Skyroot Aerospace, which launched India\u2019s first privately developed rocket in November, at some point in 2019. The test flight of Agnikul Cosmos\u2019 highly adaptable Agnibaan rocket has also been scheduled. The company is situated on the IIT-Madras campus.According to Awais Ahmed, co-founder and CEO of Pixxel, the firm is developing six commercial hyperspectral photography satellites that will be ready for launch next year.According to Ahmed, the initial orbital launches of many more rocket businesses throughout the world will result in a rocket-themed game of thrones as they compete for the same group of clients launching satellites into orbit.The start-ups are focusing on the enormous space applications market in the nation, which was previously the sole purview of ISRO. They are also planning to take tourists into space and have already carved out a niche for themselves in the earth imaging industry.According to Chaitanya Dora Surapureddy, Chief Financial Officer of Dhruva Space, \u201cThe potential for cutting-edge space applications is immense, especially if established aerospace companies form partnerships with businesses that traditionally haven\u2019t ventured into orbit, e.g., pharmaceutical and agriculture companies.\u201dOnboard ISRO\u2019s PSLV C-54 mission, Dhruva Space launched two satellites, Thybolt 1 and 2, demonstrating the feasibility of amateur satellite communication that will support ham radio operations.According to Surapureddy, Dhurva Space has already secured its first commercial contract for the construction of satellites, valued at Rs. 20 crore.According to Lt Gen A K Bhatt (ret.), Director General of the Indian Space Association (ISpA), \u201cThe number of space companies in India has now surpassed 100, and these startups have attracted finance of more than USD 245.35 million.\u201dAt ISRO\u2019s Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Agnikul also debuted its first launchpad and mission control centre.The space industry achieved some significant milestones in 2022, with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) awarding a contract worth 860 crores to the space conglomerate made up of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for the commercial development of the following five Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLVs).OneWeb also contracted with ISRO to use their launch vehicle to deploy 36 satellites from Sriharikota into low-Earth orbit. Next year, 36 additional satellites are anticipated to be launched as a follow-up.It is known that the Indians aggressively competed for the OneWeb contract with ISRO after the crisis in Ukraine forced the Russian space launch capabilities off the market.The aggressiveness of the Indian space industry, according to Chaitanya Giri, a space consultant with the Research and Information System for Developing Countries, is comparable to that of Sourav Ganguly\u2019s cricket team.\u201cOur earlier approach was very composed and polite; like Mohammad Azharuddin\u2019s cricket team, India\u2019s growing geopolitical importance is what\u2019s driving its newly discovered hostility.\u201d \u201cAdditionally, the situation in Ukraine has made it impossible to do business with Russia. The Chinese market is similar. Now, India has the advantage,\u201d Mr. Giri said.He advised Indian start-ups to compete for contracts abroad rather than turning to ISRO for business.

Next year, 36 additional satellites are anticipated to be launched as a follow-up.It is known that the Indians aggressively competed for the OneWeb contract with ISRO after the crisis in Ukraine forced the Russian space launch capabilities off the market.The aggressiveness of the Indian space industry, according to Chaitanya Giri, a space consultant with the Research and Information System for Developing Countries, is comparable to that of Sourav Ganguly\u2019s cricket team.\u201cOur earlier approach was very composed and polite; like Mohammad Azharuddin\u2019s cricket team, India\u2019s growing geopolitical importance is what\u2019s driving its newly discovered hostility.\u201d \u201cAdditionally, the situation in Ukraine has made it impossible to do business with Russia. The Chinese market is similar. Now, India has the advantage,\u201d Mr. Giri said.He advised Indian start-ups to compete for contracts abroad rather than turning to ISRO for business.\nAlso Read: ISRO Pushes The Gaganyaan Mission to 2024\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussell Chattaraj\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMechanical engineering graduate, writes about science, technology and sports, teaching physics and mathematics, also played cricket professionally and passionate about bodybuilding.\n\n\nView all posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagsIndiaISRO\n\n\nShare\nWhatsAppTwitterFacebookTelegramLinkedinVKViberReddItEmailPrint\n\n\n\nPrevious articleEarthquake of 3.8 Magnitude Strikes Delhi-NCRNext article205th Anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon Battle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\n\n\n\nArchives\n January 2023\nDecember 2022\nNovember 2022\nOctober 2022\nSeptember 2022\nAugust 2022\nJuly 2022\nJune 2022\nMay 2022\nApril 2022\nMarch 2022\nFebruary 2022\n\n\n\n\n \nLEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\n\n\nComment:\nPlease enter your comment!\n\n\nName:*\nPlease enter your name here\n\n\n\nEmail:*\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n\nWebsite:\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\n\nTrending Today\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSana Saeed Gets Engaged to Beau Csaba Wagner \n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTwo Incidents of Massive Fire in Maharashtra\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUkraine Rocked by Explosions Amid Russia\u2019s New Year Attacks\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore Than 200 Exoplanets Found Last Year\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n205th Anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon Battle\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n  ", "labels": ["Space Technology", "Real Estate", "Pop Culture", "Video Games", "Space Robotics"], "scores": [0.2680571973323822, 0.23495976626873016, 0.23363929986953735, 0.1413787305355072, 0.12196488678455353]}, {"error": "You must include at least one label and at least one sequence."}, {"error": "You must include at least one label and at least one sequence."}, {"error": "You must include at least one label and at least one sequence."}, {"sequence": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "labels": ["Video Games", "Space Robotics", "Pop Culture", "Space Technology", "Real Estate"], "scores": [0.35475462675094604, 0.20045268535614014, 0.178771510720253, 0.15856342017650604, 0.1074577048420906]}, {"error": "You must include at least one label and at least one sequence."}, {"error": "You must include at least one label and at least one sequence."}, {"error": "You must include at least one label and at least one sequence."}, {"error": "You must include at least one label and at least one sequence."}]}
