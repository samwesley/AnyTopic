What You Need To Know

OSU's George Washington Carver Science Park is expected to open up on campus in 2023

A future, permanent structure is expected to be built at OSU's airport by 2026 

Voyager Space's main hub is located in Denver, Colo.




âThis kind of all goes back to the desire of NASA to commercialize research in space,â said OSU professor Dr. Scott Shearer. Ohio State was chosen by Colorado-based space technology company Voyager Space as the home of its George Washington Carver Science Park. 
He might be in an empty classroom now, but Shearer is excited about what the future holds for the partnership.
