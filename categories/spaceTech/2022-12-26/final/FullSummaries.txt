- The sonification of this image assigns pitch based on direction from the center and brightness is mapped to louder volume. 
- RS Puppis rhythmically brightens and dims over a six week cycle and has average luminosity 15000 times greater than our Sun’s luminosity. 
- Photos of light flashes rippling across the nebula have been recorded in phenomena known as 'light echo'. 
- By observing fluctuations of light, astronomers can measure these echoes and pinpoint the distance to 6,500 light years (with 1% margin of error). Article: 8 block 1:

CE-20 Engine Hot Test: 
• On December 24, 2022, the CE-20 engine successfully operated at a thrust level of 22t for 650s. 
• The qualification for 20 t thrust level is also completed for induction flight. 
• This engine has been designed and developed by Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) in Valiamala, Kerala.  
• During the test, mixture ratio and thrust control were operational in open loop mode while all other parameters performed as predicted.   
• The engine had undergone 11 hot tests with a cumulative duration of 2720s prior to this test; 3370s total burn duration at different thrust & mixture ratio levels achieved overall. Article: 15 block 1: After scouring the observations for any natural sources, scientists suggested a more mundane explanation for these signals: Space weather, or disturbances in near-Earth space caused by solar activity."The possible natural origin of the detected signal has always been taken into consideration and discussed during our research," Youjun Lu from Beijing's National Astronomical Observatories told Space.com. "Our team was very cautious with this conclusion." 
Bullet Points: 
• UAPs increased in 2021 and technology improved, leading to more evidence they are real 
• The US government is getting serious - President Biden signed funding for investigation 
• Alleged human cases of burn injuries/brain damage due to encounters with objects reported by advanced aerospace threat program (AATIP)  
• Scientists suggest that aliens may be “intelligent but not wise” resulting in civilizations collapse or stagnating   
• METI International sent message encoded in radio signal to TRAPPIST-1 planetary system regarding climate crisis on earth  
• China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) detected 3 narrow band radio signals thought potentially originated from extraterrestrial civilization although some researchers argue it could have a mundane explanation such as space weather

block 3:  (Image credit: Michael H/Getty Images)In July 2022, scientists proposed that Earth deliberately signal its location in the universe, hoping to draw attention from advanced aliens and warn them about our world's increasingly dire climate crisis.The team hypothesized that extraterrestrials could use the "super-GHz" radio frequencies from Earth as a kind of interstellar beacon or warning sign, alerting others of our position in the cosmos."By transmitting familiar anthropogenic signals into space at super-GHz frequencies (above 100 gigahertz), we can create an artificial 'emergent phenomenon' detectable by an alien civilization over relatively large distances," researchers wrote in their study.Not everyone was convinced of the suggestion's merit.Writing on his blog (opens in new tab), astrophysicist Ethan Siegel expressed skepticism at broadcasting toward stars with potentially life-bearing worlds around them."We have no idea whether any technological civilizations exist out there  —  and signaling toward random nearby stars isn't going to change that fact," he said.5.Alien Signals?No An illustration depicting a UFO.(Image credit: Heike Langegger/NASA via Getty Images)So far, searches for intelligent communications coming from beyond our solar system have drawn blanks when it came to finding evidence for sophisticated alien societies out there somewhere among the cosmos."Particularly disappointing were two independent analyses this year confirming what has become somewhat commonsensical by now: We are not detecting strong ET [extraterrestrial] beacon signals yet," SETI scientist Seth Shostak told Space.com recently Asked if mankind is still searching for meaningful alien transmissions Shostak said humanity is indeed still looking, but so far without success."[It seems] domestic communication technology continues to be vastly more powerful than anything that might come from even Star Trek -type civilizations elsewhere  — 

Briefing Summary: 
1. This year experts believe research into UFOs will advance significantly due to improved technology software tools and qualified professionals entering the field; UAPs have been discussed extensively across government departments leading Congress urging establishment of data collection office;
2. US Defence Intelligence Agency released 1,574 pages related to Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program providing insight on cases involving burn injuries & brain damage following reported encounters with anomalous vehicles;  
3. Scientists posed Fermi paradox solution claiming civilisations may reach energy threshold preventing further growth resulting in collapse or stagnation but release energy signatures easy for detection on Earth;  
4 Proposal made suggesting intentional emission of "super GHz" radio frequency used as 'interstellar beacon' warning potential life forms of growing climate crisis;   
5 2023 yielded few results in search for alien signals however active hunt is ongoing
block 4: Or they could have left solar sails, massive structures that propel spacecraft by way of pressure from radiation emitted by stars.Seemingly more unlikely things which could be classified as alien artifacts include the many mysterious features spotted on planets and moons throughout the solar system.Bullet Point List

• In May 2022, a group called Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) aimed to send an encoded radio signal to the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system, in hopes of notifying aliens of Earth's climate crisis and possibly requesting aid. 
• The message begins with the periodic table of elements due to its universality. 
• The scientists are not expecting a response anytime soon as it would take 78 years for us to receive a reply from 39 light-years away. 
• In June 2022 China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) detected three narrow band signals but this was dismissed as caused by human interference, not intelligent life forms from space. 
• In June researchers suggested that advanced civilizations may dwell on Dyson spheres orbiting remnants of sunlike stars known as white dwarfs instead of living on planets due to their need for more energy than is available through natural sources like solar paneling alone. 
• NASA began a scientific study into UAPs in October 2022 with the primary goals being identification & characterization available UAP data, future observation collecting methods and understanding how data can advance knowledge about UFO sightings in our skies.  
• Scientists also suggested in October 2022 that extraterrestrial life forms may have left technological leftover artifacts scattered throughout the Solar System such as probes/spacecraft/debris or more unlikely items such as mysterious features seen on planets/moons throughout said system
