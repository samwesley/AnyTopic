ZeroAvia wins CAA nod for new hydrogen-electric test flights: 
• ZeroAvia has received an approval from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to conduct a test flight of its Dornier 228 aircraft. 
• The firm obtained the CAA clearance after carrying out a ground testing drive and an evaluation of the full development programme supervised by the regulator. 
• The twin-engine aircraft, which features 19 seats, has been retrofitted in an engineering testbed configuration to include ZeroAvia's hydrogen-electric engine to drive the left wing’s propellor.  
• It will operate along with a single Honeywell TPE-331 stock engine on the right during trial of propulsion technology.
• Test flights are set to begin in January 2021 as part of research and development project supported by ATI Programme aiming to build 600kw hydrogen-electric powertrain for nine to 19 people capacity planes.
