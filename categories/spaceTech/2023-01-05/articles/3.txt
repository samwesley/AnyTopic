Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Microsoft signed a memorandum of understanding on January 5 to help Indian space technology startups with technical tools, go-to-market support and mentoring to help them scale up and become business-ready. This is when there is a lot of activity in the Indian space technology startup ecosystem. 2022 will be a historic year for the ecosystem, with the country recording its first private rocket launch and many satellite launches. Bengaluru-based space tech company Digantara launched their satellite on a Space X rocket at the start of the new year. Through this partnership, space technology startups identified by ISRO will join Microsoft’s Startups Founders Hub, a platform designed to support startups at all stages. Through the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, space-tech startup founders in India will have free access to the technology tools and resources they need to build and run their businesses, Microsoft said in a statement. This includes technical support for building and extending Azure, developer and productivity tools including Visual Studio Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise, and Microsoft 365, and access to intelligent analytics with Power BI and Dynamics 365. In addition to acquiring technology, Microsoft will provide mentoring support to space technology entrepreneurs in areas ranging from space engineering to cloud technology, product and design, fundraising, and sales and marketing. In addition, founders will have access to Microsoft Learn for tailored entrepreneurship-focused training content and programs to help them connect with the industry and potential customers. Microsoft and ISRO will also organize knowledge-sharing and thought leadership sessions for startups alongside aerospace industry experts. Additionally, the partnership will provide founders with go-to-market strategies, technical support, and opportunities to sell their solutions through Microsoft channels and marketplaces. ISRO Chairman S Somanath said, “The collaboration between ISRO and Microsoft will greatly benefit space technology startups to analyze and process large volumes of satellite data for various applications using cutting-edge methods such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.” “The Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub is a useful platform to bring together startups and technology solution providers to support the national space technology ecosystem,” Somanath said. “India’s space technology startups play an important role in harnessing the power of technology to enhance the nation’s space capabilities,” said Anant Maheshwari, President of Microsoft India.
