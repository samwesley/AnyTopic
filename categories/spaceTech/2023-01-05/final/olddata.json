          " Edinburgh, 5 January, 2022. \u2013 The Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPP) successfully launched a prototype into orbit atop SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-6 mission. The Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD) will test harvesting solar power in space and then beaming the energy back to Earth, Caltech said. Space solar power provides an unlimited supply of solar energy regardless of the cycles of day and night, seasons, and cloud cover. SSPP is planning to deploy a constellation of spacecraft to collect sunlight, transform it into electricity, and transmit it to wherever it is needed. The SSPD is a 50-kg spacecraft consisting of three main experiments. DOLCE (Deployable on-Orbit ultraLight Composite Experiment) will demonstrate the architecture, packaging scheme and deployment mechanisms of the modular spacecraft. ALBA, a collection of 32 different types of photovoltaic cells, will enable an assessment of the most effective types of cells. MAPLE (Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment) will demonstrate wireless power transmission at distance in space. SSPD also features a box of electronics that controls these three experiments. Currently, solar cells on Earth generate about 4% of the world\u2019s electricity. The SSPP team aims to produce a global supply of affordable, renewable, clean energy, capable of the practical realization of space solar power.

          "Aliaksandr Marko - stock.adobe.c Are we entering a new space race? In a manner of speaking, it could be argued we\u2019re already in that race, as the barriers to launching satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) become lower, and cyber criminals subsequently identify a new source of critical information to disrupt, intercept, utilise or even take over. In this respect, the \u201crace\u201d that has already begun is one that requires both governmental and private players to unite and ensure optimum resilience across the systems being placed in our planet\u2019s periphery. Meanwhile, competitors in this \u2013 long distance but relatively quick \u2013 race are looking to build on examples of early exploitation, to enhance their competencies, and prepare for a future where space is simply a database with a bird\u2019s eye view. But what was the starting pistol that triggered this particular contest? \u201cUltimately, it is a combination of engineering factors that contribute to dramatically reduced costs of launch,\u201d says Adrian Nish, head of cyber at BAE Systems Digital Intelligence. \u201cYou can get things into space much more cheaply than in decades gone by, largely thanks to advances in technology, and manufacturers being able to integrate off-the-shelf solutions as part of the resultant satellites. \u201c\u2018Space as a service\u2019 is almost analogous to the cloud in that respect, in that customers are being offered platform space to \u2018rent\u2019, and to run applications. This commercialisation is driving the sector to become more viable, but wherever there is data being generated or stored, you also have a growing cyber security risk.\u201d BAE Systems itself has had products and services in and around space for a number of decades already, providing radios for clients including the European Space Agency, as well as for deep space missions. Nish explains that it has also sought to capitalise on the future scope of space as a new information arena, with a particular focus on low Earth orbit. \u201cAs part of this effort, though, we\u2019ve made sure we\u2019re part of the security conversation, because space as an attack surface is fundamentally different to what it was previously,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you think about a geostationary satellite, they are very much bespoke systems designed for long-life endurance in harsh environments. \u201cConversely, for low Earth orbit and nanosatellites, you can build them using more commercially available technologies. The good news is that it makes them easier to develop and manage. But it also makes it easier for attackers who also know what they\u2019re doing with these systems too.\u201d In this sense, there isn\u2019t a whole lot of difference in terms of the attack surface between on-the-ground platforms and the landscape envisaged slightly further up. That attack surface, rather, comprises not just the physical satellite, but also a ground station which effectively controls the satellite. Joining the party also are a host of receivers that then pick up information from the satellites, and aid communications. The upshot being, an attacker doesn\u2019t have to hit the satellite to hit the satellite. Nish continues: \u201cThe ground stations in particular are interesting targets as they are pretty much the same as enterprise networks. There are people sat on desktops or laptops feeding into the network. It just so happens that, at some point, that enterprise network will allow a connection up to an operating system in low Earth orbit, which might also be as familiar as a Linux system.\u201d If a threat actor can gain access to said laptop or desktop, then the potential to piggyback on whatever is being fed up to that operating system becomes a very real possibility. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve got that right, and are being delivered to an equally recognisable system, you then have potential access to peripherals in the form of cameras, motion sensors, commands, the spacecraft, essentially. Malicious things can easily follow.\u201d For anyone in any doubt of whether this likelihood of attack \u2013 and race \u2013 is already underway, criminal activity may be sparse so far, but certainly not insignificant. In the spring of 2022, global communications company Viasat experienced an outage across Europe, at almost the exact time that Russian troops entered Ukraine. As well as being a commercial broadband provider, Viasat is also used by the Ukrainian military. On closer inspection, the main damage seemed to be collateral across the continent, as a result of a misconfiguration sent down to modems. However, upon even closer testing of the memory chips from these modems, it was revealed that they had been essentially wiped out, akin to wiping the operating system from a PC. The EU, UK and US have all since concurred that the attack originated from Russia\u2019s GRU, which gained access to the internal management system through a misconfiguration, developed malware to deploy across the network to wipe the modems, and pushed that malware through on the day of the invasion. It wasn\u2019t the satellite itself that was being targeted \u2013 it was merely a portal to impact connections and operations on the ground. \u201cThis really demonstrates the lure of satellite attacks \u2013 it\u2019s the variety of impacts, and disruption on offer,\u201d Nish notes. \u201cYes, the majority of attackers are likely to be motivated by money, with space just another frontier to enact ransomware attacks on manufacturers, law firms, finance companies, etc. \u201cState actors, meanwhile, absolutely need to be factored in as well. They\u2019ll be after what they always have been \u2013 political, military or commercial insight; to misdirect; to attain data; to disrupt or destruct; to gain intelligence; and to simply see what another country is seeing as silently and covertly as possible.\u201d This is why a united, collaborative defence must be established between public entities and private players. BAE Systems is already part of the Space Security Information Exchange (SSIE) \u2013 a by-invitation group backed by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) \u2013 of which Neil Sherwin-Peddie is currently chair. He is also head of space security at BAE Systems Digital Intelligence, and is hugely motivated to mobilise stakeholders in this race\u2019s early stages. He says: \u201cUK agencies are already coming together to gain better visibility across multiple platforms and from multiple perspectives. As well as BAE Systems, the UK Space Agency and the European Space Agency, other big private players such as Airbus are also involved in the conversation, while the role of smaller businesses and even startups can\u2019t be overlooked. Security is the main part of this conversation between us all, addressing policy, process and procedure to make sure we\u2019re working in one common direction. \u201cAt the moment, there isn\u2019t a user manual or guidebook to follow to secure platforms, so it really is a case of addressing the entire infrastructure as a complete function.\u201d Ground stations are key to this effort, as the receptor of information being transmitted down from satellites, but also as the controls to guide periphery tech in space such as radios, sensors and communications tools. \u201cAs a starting point, this lays the foundations for mass management of the large, overall infrastructure, and security of the total enterprise,\u201d Sherwin-Peddie adds. \u201cWe can\u2019t just look at ground stations though, or user terminals, or the spacecraft; it\u2019s about securing the entire supply chain, knowing that if one element becomes weak or vulnerable, then the whole network has assurances in place to mitigate that.\u201d Sherwin-Peddie notes the level of urgency in this development conversation across numerous public and private parties. And, to that end, agrees that we are in something of a race; if only against time at this stage. It\u2019s an assertion that Nish agrees with, circling back to the comparisons with cloud\u2019s rise to prominence. \u201cFor years, we presumed and predicted that cloud would be the next big thing for attackers to target. How could it not be, considering what it was designed for? But then nothing really happened for a long time. Then\u2026SolarWinds. \u201cSuddenly, those initial predictions became true, all because adoption had reached a scale that became too attractive to ignore. Attackers had spent the time up to that point learning how best to exploit the cloud, what the gains would be, what data they\u2019d be accessing if successful, all so they could strike when the iron was hotter.\u201d In this analogy, space is an iron that is warming up at considerable pace. Nish affirms: \u201cAs [low orbit] becomes more utilised, more relied on, more essential, the attacks will come. Simply, the race for us is getting ahead of that inevitability and establishing resilience ahead of time.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that space still represents a technical step change from what both developers and attackers will have experienced before, despite the growing familiarities and lowering barriers to launch. From both a hardware and software perspective, the level of cutting-edge solutions set to be deployed in this realm presents a huge opportunity to slow down would-be exploiters and achieve an initial level of resilience that ensures a sizable lead in this race. Sherwin-Peddie concluded: \u201cI have in the back of my mind constantly that while this is a race, first to market might not be the best to market. This is why a collaborative approach is so vital, in developing systems and platforms that are sustainable and durable in this context. \u201cIf we get these initial conversations and developments right, with plans in place to mitigate challenges or attacks, then really, it\u2019s such an exciting \u2018space\u2019.

In a manner of speaking, it could be argued we\u2019re already in that race, as the barriers to launching satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) become lower, and cyber criminals subsequently identify a new source of critical information to disrupt, intercept, utilise or even take over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this respect, the \u201crace\u201d that has already begun is one that requires both governmental and private players to unite and ensure optimum resilience across the systems being placed in our planet\u2019s periphery. Meanwhile, competitors in this \u2013 long distance but relatively quick \u2013 race are looking to build on examples of early exploitation, to enhance their competencies, and prepare for a future where space is simply a database with a bird\u2019s eye view.\nBut what was the starting pistol that triggered this particular contest?\n\u201cUltimately, it is a combination of engineering factors that contribute to dramatically reduced costs of launch,\u201d says Adrian Nish, head of cyber at BAE Systems Digital Intelligence. \u201cYou can get things into space much more cheaply than in decades gone by, largely thanks to advances in technology, and manufacturers being able to integrate off-the-shelf solutions as part of the resultant satellites.\n\u201c\u2018Space as a service\u2019 is almost analogous to the cloud in that respect, in that customers are being offered platform space to \u2018rent\u2019, and to run applications. This commercialisation is driving the sector to become more viable, but wherever there is data being generated or stored, you also have a growing cyber security risk.\u201d\n\nA piggyback into low Earth orbit\nBAE Systems itself has had products and services in and around space for a number of decades already, providing radios for clients including the European Space Agency, as well as for deep space missions.\nNish explains that it has also sought to capitalise on the future scope of space as a new information arena, with a particular focus on low Earth orbit.\n\u201cAs part of this effort, though, we\u2019ve made sure we\u2019re part of the security conversation, because space as an attack surface is fundamentally different to what it was previously,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIf you think about a geostationary satellite, they are very much bespoke systems designed for long-life endurance in harsh environments.\n\u201cConversely, for low Earth orbit and nanosatellites, you can build them using more commercially available technologies. The good news is that it makes them easier to develop and manage. But it also makes it easier for attackers who also know what they\u2019re doing with these systems too.\u201d\nIn this sense, there isn\u2019t a whole lot of difference in terms of the attack surface between on-the-ground platforms and the landscape envisaged slightly further up.\nThat attack surface, rather, comprises not just the physical satellite, but also a ground station which effectively controls the satellite. Joining the party also are a host of receivers that then pick up information from the satellites, and aid communications.\nThe upshot being, an attacker doesn\u2019t have to hit the satellite to hit the satellite.\nNish continues: \u201cThe ground stations in particular are interesting targets as they are pretty much the same as enterprise networks. There are people sat on desktops or laptops feeding into the network. It just so happens that, at some point, that enterprise network will allow a connection up to an operating system in low Earth orbit, which might also be as familiar as a Linux system.\u201d\nIf a threat actor can gain access to said laptop or desktop, then the potential to piggyback on whatever is being fed up to that operating system becomes a very real possibility.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve got that right, and are being delivered to an equally recognisable system, you then have potential access to peripherals in the form of cameras, motion sensors, commands, the spacecraft, essentially. Malicious things can easily follow.\u201d\n\n\nA variety of impacts\nFor anyone in any doubt of whether this likelihood of attack \u2013 and race \u2013 is already underway, criminal activity may be sparse so far, but certainly not insignificant.\nIn the spring of 2022, global communications company Viasat experienced an outage across Europe, at almost the exact time that Russian troops entered Ukraine. As well as being a commercial broadband provider, Viasat is also used by the Ukrainian military. On closer inspection, the main damage seemed to be collateral across the continent, as a result of a misconfiguration sent down to modems.\nHowever, upon even closer testing of the memory chips from these modems, it was revealed that they had been essentially wiped out, akin to wiping the operating system from a PC. The EU, UK and US have all since concurred that the attack originated from Russia\u2019s GRU, which gained access to the internal management system through a misconfiguration, developed malware to deploy across the network to wipe the modems, and pushed that malware through on the day of the invasion. It wasn\u2019t the satellite itself that was being targeted \u2013 it was merely a portal to impact connections and operations on the ground.\n\u201cThis really demonstrates the lure of satellite attacks \u2013 it\u2019s the variety of impacts, and disruption on offer,\u201d Nish notes. \u201cYes, the majority of attackers are likely to be motivated by money, with space just another frontier to enact ransomware attacks on manufacturers, law firms, finance companies, etc.\n\u201cState actors, meanwhile, absolutely need to be factored in as well. They\u2019ll be after what they always have been \u2013 political, military or commercial insight; to misdirect; to attain data; to disrupt or destruct; to gain intelligence; and to simply see what another country is seeing as silently and covertly as possible.\u201d\n\n\nSecuring the entire bubble\nThis is why a united, collaborative defence must be established between public entities and private players.\nBAE Systems is already part of the Space Security Information Exchange (SSIE) \u2013 a by-invitation group backed by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) \u2013 of which Neil Sherwin-Peddie is currently chair. He is also head of space security at BAE Systems Digital Intelligence, and is hugely motivated to mobilise stakeholders in this race\u2019s early stages.\nHe says: \u201cUK agencies are already coming together to gain better visibility across multiple platforms and from multiple perspectives. As well as BAE Systems, the UK Space Agency and the European Space Agency, other big private players such as Airbus are also involved in the conversation, while the role of smaller businesses and even startups can\u2019t be overlooked. Security is the main part of this conversation between us all, addressing policy, process and procedure to make sure we\u2019re working in one common direction.\n\u201cAt the moment, there isn\u2019t a user manual or guidebook to follow to secure platforms, so it really is a case of addressing the entire infrastructure as a complete function.\u201d\nGround stations are key to this effort, as the receptor of information being transmitted down from satellites, but also as the controls to guide periphery tech in space such as radios, sensors and communications tools.\n\u201cAs a starting point, this lays the foundations for mass management of the large, overall infrastructure, and security of the total enterprise,\u201d Sherwin-Peddie adds. \u201cWe can\u2019t just look at ground stations though, or user terminals, or the spacecraft; it\u2019s about securing the entire supply chain, knowing that if one element becomes weak or vulnerable, then the whole network has assurances in place to mitigate that.\u201d\n\n\nFirst isn\u2019t always best\nSherwin-Peddie notes the level of urgency in this development conversation across numerous public and private parties. And, to that end, agrees that we are in something of a race; if only against time at this stage.\nIt\u2019s an assertion that Nish agrees with, circling back to the comparisons with cloud\u2019s rise to prominence.\n\u201cFor years, we presumed and predicted that cloud would be the next big thing for attackers to target. How could it not be, considering what it was designed for? But then nothing really happened for a long time. Then\u2026SolarWinds.\n\u201cSuddenly, those initial predictions became true, all because adoption had reached a scale that became too attractive to ignore. Attackers had spent the time up to that point learning how best to exploit the cloud, what the gains would be, what data they\u2019d be accessing if successful, all so they could strike when the iron was hotter.\u201d\nIn this analogy, space is an iron that is warming up at considerable pace.\nNish affirms: \u201cAs [low orbit] becomes more utilised, more relied on, more essential, the attacks will come. Simply, the race for us is getting ahead of that inevitability and establishing resilience ahead of time.\u201d\nIt shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that space still represents a technical step change from what both developers and attackers will have experienced before, despite the growing familiarities and lowering barriers to launch.\nFrom both a hardware and software perspective, the level of cutting-edge solutions set to be deployed in this realm presents a huge opportunity to slow down would-be exploiters and achieve an initial level of resilience that ensures a sizable lead in this race.\nSherwin-Peddie concluded: \u201cI have in the back of my mind constantly that while this is a race, first to market might not be the best to market. This is why a collaborative approach is so vital, in developing systems and platforms that are sustainable and durable in this context.\n\u201cIf we get these initial conversations and developments right, with plans in place to mitigate challenges or attacks, then really, it\u2019s such an exciting \u2018space\u2019. One that will soon house hugely impressive feats of engineering, and technological breakthroughs for the future.\u201d\n\n\nRead more about space technology\n\nA growing space industry is creating business opportunities in space, ranging from Earth observation and communications to space tourism and, eventually, asteroid mining.\nMark Chang, an aerospace, defence and security expert at PA Consulting, looks at the actions that organisations need to take to harness the potential of space services data.\nAs satellite broadband industry rockets, report from Commons Science and Technology Committee criticises government\u2019s failures in key technical areas and continues to question value to taxpayer of OneWeb joint venture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more on IT risk management\n\n\n\nA rising space industry will create new jobs and products\n\n\n\n\nBy: Makenzie Holland\n\n\n\n\nUK government approach to space industry lacks coherence and investment\n\n\n\n\nBy: Joe O\u2019Halloran\n\n\n\n\nCGI gets ESA order to develop predictive routing tool for satellite constellations\n\n\n\n\nBy: Joe O\u2019Halloran\n\n\n\n\nStarlink\n\n\n\n\nBy: Kinza Yasar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nHow technology is fuelling CommBank\u2019s customer experience\n\n\nTraditional banking under threat from platform-based alternatives\n\n\nSt Helens Council plumps for Unit4 ERP to forward automation plans\n\n\nView All News\n\n\n\n\n\tDownload Computer Weekly\n\n\n\nIn The Current Issue:\n\nPost Office scandal: Cock-up or cook-up? \nClearing the barriers to full digital connectivity\n\n\n\t\t\tDownload Current Issue\n\n\n\n\nLatest Blog Posts\n\n\nOpen Seas: Common file synchronisation issues in today\u2019s hybrid world\n\u2013 CW Developer Network\n\n\nWhat to expect from Civo Navigate 2023\n\u2013 CW Developer Network\n\n\nView All Blogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nLessons to be learned from attempted $1bn bank heist\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\nUK Parliamentary committee casts doubt on value of ...\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\nGovernment remains in orbit to develop UK sat nav\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "Wandering stars that are not gravitationally tied to any one galaxy in a cluster can be found in clusters of hundreds or thousands of galaxies.

Young children sometimes believe that the moon is following them, or that they can reach out and touch it. It appears to be much closer than is proportional to its true distance. As we move about our daily lives, we tend to think that we navigate space in a linear way. But Salk scientists have discovered that time spent exploring an environment causes neural representations to grow in surprising ways.      The findings, published in Nature Neuroscience on December 29, 2022, show that neurons in the hippocampus essential for spatial navigation, memory, and planning represent space in a manner that conforms to a nonlinear hyperbolic geometry\u2014a three-dimensional expanse that grows outward exponentially. (In other words, it\u2019s shaped like the interior of an expanding hourglass.) The researchers also found that the size of that space grows with time spent in a place. And the size is increasing in a logarithmic fashion that matches the maximal possible increase in information being processed by the brain.   This discovery provides valuable methods for analyzing data on neurocognitive disorders involving learning and memory, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.   \u201cOur study demonstrates that the brain does not always act in a linear manner. Instead, neural networks function along an expanding curve, which can be analyzed and understood using hyperbolic geometry and information theory,\u201d says Salk Professor Tatyana Sharpee, holder of the Edwin K. Hunter Chair, who led the study. \u201cIt is exciting to see that neural responses in this area of the brain formed a map that expanded with experience based on the amount of time devoted in a given place. The effect even held for miniscule deviations in time when animal ran more slowly or faster through the environment.\u201d   Sharpee\u2019s lab uses advanced computational approaches to better understand how the brain works. They recently pioneered the use of hyperbolic geometry to better understand biological signals like smell molecules, as well as the perception of smell.   In the current study, the scientists found that hyperbolic geometry guides neural responses as well. Hyperbolic maps of sensory molecules and events are perceived with hyperbolic neural maps. The space representations dynamically expanded in correlation with the amount of time the rat spent exploring each environment. And, when a rat moved more slowly through an environment, it gained more information about the space, which caused the neural representations to grow even more.   \u201cThe findings provide a novel perspective on how neural representations can be altered with experience,\u201d says Huanqiu Zhang, a graduate student in Sharpee\u2019s lab. \u201cThe geometric principles identified in our study can also guide future endeavors in understanding neural activity in various brain systems.\u201d   \u201cYou would think that hyperbolic geometry only applies on a cosmic scale, but that is not true,\u201d says Sharpee. \u201cOur brains work much slower than the speed of light, which could be a reason that hyperbolic effects are observed on graspable spaces instead of astronomical ones. Next, we would like to learn more about how these dynamic hyperbolic representations in the brain grow, interact, and communicate with one another.\u201d  Reference:  Zhang H, Rich PD, Lee AK, Sharpee TO.

          "Feedback Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and American tech giant Microsoft announced on Thursday that they will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to support and empower space technology (space-tech) start-ups in India. The MoU also seeks to fuel the growth of these start-ups with technology tools and platforms, go-to-market support, and mentoring which will further help them scale and become enterprise-ready.\n \nCommenting on this development, S Somanath, Chairman of ISRO, said, \u201cISRO\u2019s collaboration with Microsoft will greatly benefit space tech startups in their analysis and processing of vast amounts of satellite data for various applications, using cutting-edge methods like AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\u201d\n \nThis initiative is a part of Bill Gates\u2019 co-founded company\u2019s Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub campaign which was launched to support the national space technology ecosystem. The program gives free access to tools and resources to space-tech start-up founders at every stage of their journey right from the ideation phase to becoming a unicorn.\n \nAnant Maheshwari, President of Microsoft India, said that they are \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to empowering space tech startups in the country \u201cto drive cutting-edge innovation and accelerate scientific discovery.\u201d He also said, \u201cSpace tech startups in India are playing a significant role in advancing the country\u2019s space capabilities with the power of technology. We are pleased to collaborate with ISRO to accelerate this transformation of what\u2019s possible in space.\u201d\n \nBeyond access to technology, Microsoft will provide mentoring support to the entrepreneurs operating in this space in areas ranging from space engineering to cloud technologies, product, and design, fundraising, and sales and marketing. Microsoft and ISRO will also jointly organise knowledge-sharing and thought leadership sessions for the start-ups with space industry experts. This announcement comes against the backdrop of Satya Nadella\u2019s (who is also the CEO of Microsoft) four-day visit to India. \"It\u2019s fantastic to be back in India this week, meeting with so many innovators and changemakers, like these employees at State Bank of India who are using technology to make a difference at their organization \u2013 and across the country,\" he said in a post on LinkedIn yesterday.\n \nApart from meeting key customers, startups, developers, educators, and students, Nadella also addressed Microsoft Future Ready Leadership Summit in Mumbai on Tuesday.

          " Thursday, Jan 05, 2023 | Last Update : 07:27 PM IST Bengaluru: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Microsoft on Thursday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to fuel the growth of space technology start-ups in India. The MoU seeks to empower space tech start-ups across the country with technology tools and platforms, go-to-market support and mentoring to help them scale and become enterprise-ready. This collaboration has come at a time when Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella is in the city to take part in Microsoft Future Ready Technology Summit . The collaboration seeks to strengthen ISRO's vision of harnessing the market potential of the most promising space tech innovators and entrepreneurs in India, Microsoft said in a release. Through this tie-up, the space tech start-ups identified by ISRO will be onboarded onto the 'Microsoft for Start-ups Founders Hub platform', that supports start-ups at every stage of their journey-from idea to unicorn, it said. Noting that through the hub, space-tech start-up founders in India will have free access to the tech tools and resources they need to build and run their business, the release further said, this includes technical support to build and scale on Azure, best-in-class developer and productivity tools including GitHub Enterprise, Visual Studio Enterprise and Microsoft 365 and access to smart analytics with Power BI and Dynamics 365. ISRO Chairman S Somanath said the space agency's collaboration with Microsoft will greatly benefit space tech start-ups in their analysis and processing of vast amounts of satellite data for various applications, using cutting-edge methods like AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. \"The Microsoft for Start-ups Founders Hub is a useful platform for bringing together start-ups and providers of technology solutions to support the national space technology ecosystem. We are pleased to work together to assist and support entrepreneurs, to in turn benefit the Indian economy as a whole,\" he said. Beyond access to technology, Microsoft will provide mentoring support to space tech entrepreneurs in areas ranging from space engineering to cloud technologies, product and design, fund-raising and sales and marketing. In addition, founders will have access to Microsoft Learn for tailored start-up centric training content and programmes to help them build connections with the industry and potential customers. \"Space tech start-ups in India are playing a significant role in advancing the country's space capabilities with the power of technology. We are pleased to collaborate with ISRO to accelerate this transformation of what's possible in space. Through our technology tools, platforms and mentorship opportunities, we are deeply committed to empowering space tech start-ups in the country to drive cutting edge innovation and accelerate scientific discovery,\" Microsoft India President Anant Maheshwari said. Microsoft and ISRO will also jointly organise knowledge sharing and thought leadership sessions for the start-ups with space industry experts. In addition, the collaboration will support founders with go-to-market strategies, technical support and opportunities to sell their solutions via Microsoft channels and marketplace, the release said. \n\t  We have updated our Privacy and Cookie Policy.
