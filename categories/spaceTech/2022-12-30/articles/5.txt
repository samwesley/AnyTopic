NASA’s Astronomical and Historic 2022 – A Major Step for Humanity [Video]
By NASA
December 30, 2022The James Webb Space Telescope is a space observatory to see further into the Universe than ever before. In July 2022 it became fully operational for science and released its first full-color images and spectroscopic data. Credit: ESA/ATG medialabIn 2022, we helped humanity take a major step toward a permanent presence in deep space …We captured new awe-inspiring views of the universe …And we witnessed a first-of-its-kind mission hit its mark …Here’s a look back at those and other things we did this year at NASA.In 2022, NASA launched their mega Moon rocket for the first time – sending the uncrewed Orion spacecraft around the Moon, they kicked off a new era in astronomy with record-breaking new imagery from the Webb Space Telescope, they moved an asteroid in humanity’s first-ever planetary defense demonstration and much more. Here’s a look back at those and other things they did, this year @NASA!NASA’s Space Launch System rocket carrying the Orion spacecraft launches on the Artemis I flight test, Wednesday, November 16, 2022, from Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA’s Artemis I mission is the first integrated flight test of the agency’s deep space exploration systems: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and ground systems. SLS and Orion launched at 1:47 a.m. ET from Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center. Credit: NASA/Bill IngallsMoon to Mars*Artemis I Mega Rocket Launches Orion to Moon*Splashdown!

NASA’s Astronomical and Historic 2022 – A Major Step for Humanity [Video]TOPICS:NASABy NASA
December 30, 2022The James Webb Space Telescope is a space observatory to see further into the Universe than ever before. In July 2022 it became fully operational for science and released its first full-color images and spectroscopic data. Credit: ESA/ATG medialabIn 2022, we helped humanity take a major step toward a permanent presence in deep space …We captured new awe-inspiring views of the universe …And we witnessed a first-of-its-kind mission hit its mark …Here’s a look back at those and other things we did this year at NASA.In 2022, NASA launched their mega Moon rocket for the first time – sending the uncrewed Orion spacecraft around the Moon, they kicked off a new era in astronomy with record-breaking new imagery from the Webb Space Telescope, they moved an asteroid in humanity’s first-ever planetary defense demonstration and much more. Here’s a look back at those and other things they did, this year @NASA!NASA’s Space Launch System rocket carrying the Orion spacecraft launches on the Artemis I flight test, Wednesday, November 16, 2022, from Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA’s Artemis I mission is the first integrated flight test of the agency’s deep space exploration systems: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and ground systems. SLS and Orion launched at 1:47 a.m. ET from Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center. Credit: NASA/Bill IngallsMoon to Mars*Artemis I Mega Rocket Launches Orion to Moon*Splashdown!
