          "\n \n\n\n\n\n It\u2019s been a big year in tech: the race to build the metaverse, the rise and fall of non-fungible tokens, chaos in the crypto sector, amazing views of galaxies far, far, away and research breakthroughs that will change the way we live. Marketplace\u2019s Kimberly Adams and \u201cMarketplace Tech\u201d producers J\u00e9sus Alvarado and Daniel Shin discuss what stories they\u2019ll be following in 2023.  The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Kimberly Adams: So I\u2019m going to take this one first and latch on to a story I\u2019ve loved covering in 2022 and I think is going to still be big in 2023, which is space and space exploration. There is more money, more interest, more research going into expanding [into] space, potentially mining and space, getting ready for the Artemis moon missions. And I do think that we\u2019re going to continue to see just sort of the development of the space economy. It feels like there are launches every other day now, and each of those are loaded with experiments. More and more countries are getting involved. And I think that\u2019s going to keep being a story for the next year. Daniel, what about you? What do you think? Daniel Shin: Well, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of this thing called generative artificial intelligence tools. They may have come across your radar? Adams: ChatGPT? Shin: OpenAI, that kind of stuff, that\u2019s only going to get better, there\u2019s only going to get more money into this space. We\u2019re all expecting a bit of [an economic] slowdown, and people are going to want to invest smartly. I have to imagine that this is one big thing. These tools are being used by everyone, not just engineers or coders \u2014 doctors, copywriters, audio editors, like myself (I don\u2019t use it right now). But it\u2019s pierced this veil and gone beyond just folks who are technically proficient with this kind of stuff, and it\u2019s going to be a central focus for cultural discourse next year, in regards to just what value is a piece of art or a piece of work by an AI bot. It could supplement or enhance or replace labor, I think a lot of folks or companies are going to look that way. This space is just going to continue to grow, whether you want it to or not. Adams: Yeah, and there\u2019s already a lot of people raising red flags about ways that this might be harmful. But yeah, definitely a story we\u2019re gonna have to watch in the coming year. J\u00e9sus, what do you have your eye on? J\u00e9sus Alvarado: Well, on the heels of artificial intelligence, I\u2019ll be for sure looking at what people are now calling emotional recognition technology, which of course uses AI and a mix of even biometric data. So for 2023, I will be looking at that and see how that expands, because right now, it\u2019s not used at scale. But of course, when we talk about artificial intelligence, especially biometric data and facial recognition, we can\u2019t ignore that, you know, there might be some implications that come with it. And so I\u2019ll be interested in seeing what potential algorithmic biases or even privacy issues come out of this technology. But Kimberly, what else are you looking out for in 2023? Adams: Well, as you know, I\u2019m here in Washington, D.C., so I cannot ignore the policy story. It\u2019s a divided government with the Republicans in control of the House, Democrats in control of the Senate and the White House, which means it\u2019s going to be really hard for tech legislation to move forward. But I do think that on the regulatory side with the federal agencies, we\u2019re gonna see some action, especially with the spectacular collapse of the crypto industry. It\u2019s really giving federal regulators an opening to kind of zoom in and maybe set up some guardrails around some of these new products around crypto and [decentralized finance] and NFTs and all these other products. Daniel, what other predictions do you have? Shin: I mean, related to the fractured nature of the tech policy landscape here, and it relates to sort of a thing we\u2019ve been exploring regularly, is the constant sort of retreat into our own online spaces, and just sort of being a bit more divided and kind of going into our own enclaves. You know, we\u2019ve seen the rise of more conservative platforms, Truth Social, Gab, that kind of thing, the rise of Mastodon as an alternative to the spaces like Twitter, and I don\u2019t see any sort of existing app or the possibility of a new app coming up and disrupting the popularity of things like TikTok or strong players like Twitter, like Facebook, like Instagram. Adams: Right, because I guess as we\u2019re retreating to our own individual corners of the internet, it allows these ideas to sort of percolate in darkness and then burst out into the public sphere online and kind of go everywhere. J\u00e9sus, switching gears a bit, what else are you looking ahead to for 2023? Alvarado: You know, we threw out the word policy and legislation and whatnot. On those topics, I am going to be looking out for what new climate tech startups come up in 2023. We saw this past year the Inflation Reduction Act being signed into law, which allocates $370 billion into climate and energy projects. So yeah, I\u2019d be interested to see what new players come into the space with tangible solutions and tangible innovations that sort of help us adapt to this changing climate, which, being here in California, we sort of experienced the heat of living through two to three weeks of triple digits. So we are all feeling it, and that is what I\u2019ll be looking out for in 2023. Every day, the \u201cMarketplace Tech\u201d team demystifies the digital economy with stories that explore more than just Big Tech. We\u2019re committed to covering topics that matter to you and the world around us, diving deep into how technology intersects with climate change, inequity, and disinformation.

          "2022 marks the year when humanity again turned its attention to the Moon with NASA\u2019s Artemis 1 mission fly-by around Earth\u2019s lone satellite. The Orion spacecraft concluded a 25-day mission, which saw it go to the Moon, orbit it, and return in a mission that will serve as the precursor to the first manned mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. While NASA expects to launch the Artemis 2 mission in 2023, many other lunar missions from across the globe are scheduled. These range from Indian and Russian state-sponsored missions to those designed and launched by private space technology companies. Here, we have put together a list of missions that you can expect to reach the Moon in 2023. Hakuto-R is a lunar lander developed by ispace, a Japanese space technology. It launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on December 11, 2022, along with the Rashid Rover, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 first lunar rover, and NASA\u2019s Lunar Flashlight.\nEven though the Hakuto lander launched in December 2022, it is only expected to reach the Moon by April 2023. This is because the lander is taking a slow, low-energy path that will see the spacecraft fly about 1.6 million kilometres from the Earth, before looping back and intersecting with the Moon by April next year. Although Hakuto is in contention for the first privately-built lunar lander to go to the Moon, the lander of Pittsburgh-based Astrobiotic Technology and Houston-based Intuitive Machines might beat out the mission, even though it will not launch until early 2023. ispace\u2019s 2.3-metre tall lander will aim for the Atlas crater in the northeastern section of the Moon\u2019s near side. Shortly after launch, the Hakuto spacecraft sent back images of a \u201ccrescent Earth.\u201d The Rashid Rover is named after Dubai\u2019s royal family and weighs just 10 kilograms. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 lunar mission comes after the country sent a science satellite into orbit around Mars, and the rover will explore the lunar surface for about 10 days after it lands in April 2023. NASA\u2019s Lunar Flashlight spacecraft also hitched a ride about the SpaceX M1 mission that launched Ispace\u2019s lander and the Rashid Rover. The spacecraft is a small satellite that is about the size of a briefcase. It is currently on its three-month journey to the Moon. The mission\u2019s trajectory will take the spacecraft far beyond the Moon, before the combined gravity of the Earth and the Sun helps it settle into a science-gathering lunar orbit. While in the lunar orbit, it will swoop low over the Moon\u2019s South Pole, where it will use lasers to shed light on dark craters, which according to NASA have not seen sunlight in billions of years. It is known that water exists in lunar regolith (soil), but scientists do not yet understand whether the floors of these craters are covered by surface ice frost. The Lunar Flashlight is designed to help scientists probe this. Chandrayaan-3 will be a follow up to the Chandrayaan 2 mission, which failed to achieve a soft-landing on the Moon for ISRO\u2019s lunar lander and rover. Chandrayaan-3 will be a mission repeat of Chandrayaan-2, which will consist of a lunar lander and a lunar rover. The propulsion module behaves like a communications relay satellite for the spacecraft that land. The Chandrayaan-3 mission is scheduled to launch aboard a Launch Vehicle Marks 3 (LVM3, earlier known as GSLV3) in June this year. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration to an orbit 100 kilometres above the lunar surface. The propulsion module will also carry a Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and polarimetric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit. The payloads aboard the lunar lander will include Chandra\u2019s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its variations. It will also carry a passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA for ranging studies. The lunar rover will carry an Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) to help scientists understand the elemental composition of the geography in the vicinity of the landing site. After many delays, Russia\u2019s Roscosmos space agency plans to launch its Luna-25 mission to the Moon in July 2023. According to Forbes, Luna-25 is a planned lunar lander mission, which will be the country\u2019s first since the Soviet Union\u2019s Luna 24 mission in 1976. The Luna 25 mission is scheduled to land at the Moon\u2019s South Pole at a crater called Boguslavsky, and will serve as a preparatory mission that is largely about testing lunar landing landing technology. But it will also contain a suite of scientific instruments that will work on the Moon for about a year. The Luna 25 mission will also lay a laser retroreflector that will allow laser beams to be sent from the Earth to the Moon. The time taken by the beams to be reflected back to Earth will help scientists measure precisely how far away the Moon is and how far it oscillates during its orbit around the Earth. Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa bought all the tickets for the maiden lunar voyage of Elon Musk-owned SpaceX. The mission is scheduled to happen in 2023, but according to Reuters, it faced many delays due to ongoing tests of the spacecraft and its rockets. While it can\u2019t yet be confirmed whether the mission will launch in 2023, if it does, it will beat NASA\u2019s manned Artemis 2 mission to the Moon. The mission will be launched on SpaceX\u2019s Starship launch vehicle, and will take eight days from launch to splashdown on Earth. This includes the three days it will spend circling the moon in a lunar orbit that will take it within 200 kilometres of the Moon\u2019s surface. Maezawa used Twitter to recruit eight crew members from around the world to join him in what could be the first manned mission to the Moon in more than 50 years. Among the members selected is Indian actor Dev Joshi, who is joining a crew that largely comprises artists and photographers. Among the other high profile members is Choi Seng Hyun, a K-pop singer who was part of the band Big Band and Japanese-American musician Steve Aoki.

          " Rory Fitzpatrick, CEO of the National Space Centre Ltd near Midleton, Co Cork. Picture: David Keane. \u201cI GUARANTEE this: When the first ship lands on Mars \u2014 and it looks like Elon Musk\u2019s will be the first to get someone up there and it\u2019ll happen fairly soon \u2014 once they do, the whole planet is going to go space mad.\u201d So says CEO of the National Space Centre based in Midleton, Rory Fitzpatrick. As billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson compete in the modern-day space race, and commercial activity around space continues to gather momentum, Mr Fitzpatrick predicts that the people founding the next wave of start-ups will be looking to the stars. \u201cThe first guy lands on Mars, everybody\u2019s going to go space mad. Every cereal box will come with space toys, McDonald\u2019s will be doing space stuff, every ad on TV will have a space twist, it will be exactly like it was in the 60s when the moon landing was going on\u2026 it\u2019s going to be the same again, and with that you are going to have a massive boom in space related business,\u201d he said. As Ireland prepares to launch its first national satellite early next year, EIRSAT-1, the Government is eager to foster Ireland\u2019s fledgling space sector, and capitalise on the global commercial space industry, estimated to grow to approximately US $1 trillion by 2040. The number of Irish companies engaged with European Space Agency contracts across the country is still less than 100, but the sector has grown almost 40% in the last four years. Mr Fitzpatrick highlights that Ireland, and Cork, are particularly well placed to become hubs of space related business activity. \n\u201cThere is going to be an industry that grows and develops out of this, and Ireland is really well positioned\u2026 we have very highly qualified graduates, we\u2019re part of Europe but we\u2019re English speaking, we\u2019re a really good bridge between the US and Europe, and I think those are the key things that make us a real sweet spot,\u201d he said.\n The Elfordstown Earthstation, where the National Space Centre now operates, was strategically based in Midleton in the 1980s because of particular advantages to the Cork location. Originally built as a pan-European project to transmit telephone calls via satellite between Europe and the US, Ireland was the natural choice for the teleport, as the EU country that looked further west than anywhere else. With better visibility to satellites in the south of the country, Cork was chosen for its particularly good infrastructure, and the natural dip in the landscape around Midleton proved quiet for radio noise. Mr Fitzpatrick said that Cork is still to this day a good location for space-related industry, for all the reasons it was singled out in the 1980s, added to the fact that large corporations with a likely interest in evolving space tech, like Apple, are already based here. Having taken over the Elfordstown Earthstation in 2010, the National Space Centre now uses the facility for both commercial broadcasting and teleport services to communicate with satellites, and commercial contracts for research and development. Mr Fitzpatrick said the centre is currently in discussions with a number of commercial partners to fund the refurbishment of \u201cThe Big Dish\u201d at the station, for communication to the moon and Mars.  He said that the boost from commercial investment in Cork\u2019s space sector fills the gap that State investment can\u2019t meet. \u201cThe difficulty for us is that the Irish Government\u2019s budget for space is too small, so they can\u2019t afford infrastructure projects\u2026 They couldn\u2019t put money into us because we\u2019d need all the Irish budget in one fell swoop, so our only option really is commercial business,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the last 10 years, we\u2019ve brought some of the top space companies in the world into Ireland to operate stuff to satellite from Cork,\u201d he added, noting that space companies such as theirs based in Cork have \u201cexciting\u201d opportunities in the commercial world. Mr Fitzpatrick has seen a huge increase in interest in the space industry amongst young entrepreneurs, and said the National Space Centre hopes to host a special event in the new year to give them a head start. \u201cComing out of lockdown, and everything else that\u2019s gone on, you have a lot of young people who just want to get out and do stuff\u2026 there\u2019s a massive amount of 20-something young people starting space companies, and they\u2019re doing everything; space breathing apparatus, space suits, everything you can imagine they\u2019re making up, they\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the new year we\u2019re going to hold a space start-up event for young people that are interested in starting up space companies. They can come down, they can ask us anything they want\u2026 we\u2019ll tell them, warts and all, who to talk to, where to chase down money, and the actual logistics of how to start up a space company.\u201d Mr Fitzpatrick said it will likely be February or March when the space start-up event takes place, and for interested entrepreneurs to keep an eye out for details on the National Space Centre\u2019s website. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone doing the long walk around, knocking on all the doors and everything else, and if we can short circuit younger people so they don\u2019t have to waste as much time as we did knocking on doors that won\u2019t open, then that\u2019s a brilliant thing,\u201d he said. Cork \u2018ticks a lot of boxes\u2019 for small, growing space technology businesses SPEAKING about the potential for Cork to develop as a leading hub for space technology, Kevin O\u2019Neill, co-founder of Cork-based space sensor technology company PixQuanta, said that it \u201cticks a lot of boxes\u201d. \u201cIt ticks a lot of boxes for small businesses that are growing\u2026 Cork is a great place to set up a business like that because it\u2019s very accessible internationally, it\u2019s a great town, it\u2019s very attractive for prospective employees to come with their families from outside of Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cI think particularly the ecosystem of the universities here means that you have a lot of synergy with high tech supports. PixQuanta for example has a really good relationship with the Tyndall Institute, and that allows us to do things much faster than if we were located elsewhere,\u201d he added. Talking about the potential for growth of businesses getting involved in space, Mr O\u2019Neill said it has been exciting to see how their light sensor technology, originally designed to sense objects in space, can have applications in other areas. \u201cThe big application for us is obviously space, we\u2019ve been funded very generously by the European Space Agency now for a couple of years\u2026 [but] we\u2019re speaking with business customers in the automotive sector, in the consumer sector, in the data communication sector. It\u2019s really exciting to see how one core technology platform can have a significant disruptive effect in multiple different applications,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to dismiss investments in space as boondoggles, as a waste of money. But I would emphasise, for every euro Ireland or the ESA invests, we get four euros back into the economy, creating jobs, creating products that will trickle down to the consumer level. It\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d he added. Mr O\u2019Neill said that businesses entering the space sector today benefit from a synergy between commercial income streams and funding from entities such as the European Space Agency. \u201cSpace takes a very long view, because it\u2019s a very long process to get to the reliability level of a technology that\u2019s suitable for space. \u201cConsumer is very fast. If a consumer company like a phone manufacturer sees a space technology that they think is useful for their next-gen phone, they\u2019ll want it yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cThese different application spaces work in very different time scales. It\u2019s great to have the support of something like the European Space Agency that takes the long view, but that also acknowledges that companies need to be diverse, they need to not only be ready to supply to the space industry, but also be positioned so they can supply to other industries like automotive and consumer,\u201d he added. UCC and MTU pushing out the new talent needed by space companies RATHER than developing space technology to help explore the wider reaches of the universe, Cork-based Treemetrics is harnessing the power of satellite imaging to help learn more about our own planet. Treemetrics co-founder Enda Keane explained how their company now uses \u201cthe three pillars of space\u201d, satellite imagery, GPS navigation and satellite communication, to monitor and help manage forests around the world. The company works with governments and private forest owners around the world, to monitor the health of forests and whether they\u2019re being managed sustainably. \u201cWe purchase satellite images off the European Space Agency and other space agencies. Our software then analyses the satellite image and detects any disturbance that\u2019s happened over a period of time\u2026 if trees are being illegally cut we spot that, if the trees are being disturbed due to storms or fire or insect attack, our software will pick that up and explain it to the owner,\u201d said Mr Keane.  \u201cOur main customers now are forest owners who are managing their forests for carbon credits. Companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, they\u2019re purchasing credits from the forest owners, in return for the forest owners to preserve the forest or manage the forest in a way that captures more carbon\u2026 tonnes of carbon are quantified by us and then the owner gets paid based on our calculations. We\u2019re like an independent valuer, the auditor of the resource,\u201d he added. Mr Keane said that over the past 17 years since Treemetrics started, the quality and accessibility of satellite imagery and space technology has rapidly changed. \u201cComputer power is so much better. When we used to get a satellite image 17 years ago, it might take days to process, where now we can process in seconds. When we were purchasing satellite images 10 years ago, you had to buy 100 square kilometers minimum and it was costing us $5,000 (\u20ac4,700) . Now we can buy that same data for $10 (\u20ac9.50) or $20 (\u20ac18.80),\u201d he said. Mr Keane paid credit to the government\u2019s support of the European Space Agency, which allows companies like Treemetrics to win funding contracts to explore new opportunities, and helps to further the continuous improvement of space tech. He said that the constant drive to develop and avail of changing technologies means that space companies are constantly in need of new talent, something not short in supply in Cork, making it an ideal base. \u201cThere\u2019s constant innovation happening. Every so many months there\u2019s a new satellite being launched, and those satellites are better at measuring the world\u2026 The great thing about space technology is that the R&D is non-stop, which means we have to keep evolving, we have to keep learning, we\u2019re constantly in an R&D phase ourselves to take advantage of satellite technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThe colleges in fairness, MTU and UCC, are continuing to bring out the talent, so the talent is here. I think [the space sector] is going to keep evolving, there\u2019s going to be a constant push for R&D, so we\u2019re going to have to keep pushing out the talent out of the universities,\u201d he added.

          "Fri, 30 Dec, 2022 - 09:45Cork well placed to be space business hubEllen O\u2019Regan hears from the CEO of the National Space Centre on why the future is bright for the space industry in Cork   Rory Fitzpatrick, CEO of the National Space Centre Ltd near Midleton, Co Cork. Picture: David Keane.\uf09a \uf099 \uf232 \uf0e1 \uf0e0Ellen O'Regan\u201cI GUARANTEE this: When the first ship lands on Mars \u2014 and it looks like Elon Musk\u2019s will be the first to get someone up there and it\u2019ll happen fairly soon \u2014 once they do, the whole planet is going to go space mad.\u201dSo says CEO of the National Space Centre based in Midleton, Rory Fitzpatrick.As billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson compete in the modern-day space race, and commercial activity around space continues to gather momentum, Mr Fitzpatrick predicts that the people founding the next wave of start-ups will be looking to the stars.\u201cThe first guy lands on Mars, everybody\u2019s going to go space mad. Every cereal box will come with space toys, McDonald\u2019s will be doing space stuff, every ad on TV will have a space twist, it will be exactly like it was in the 60s when the moon landing was going on\u2026 it\u2019s going to be the same again, and with that you are going to have a massive boom in space related business,\u201d he said.As Ireland prepares to launch its first national satellite early next year, EIRSAT-1, the Government is eager to foster Ireland\u2019s fledgling space sector, and capitalise on the global commercial space industry, estimated to grow to approximately US $1 trillion by 2040.The number of Irish companies engaged with European Space Agency contracts across the country is still less than 100, but the sector has grown almost 40% in the last four years.Mr Fitzpatrick highlights that Ireland, and Cork, are particularly well placed to become hubs of space related business activity.\n\u201cThere is going to be an industry that grows and develops out of this, and Ireland is really well positioned\u2026 we have very highly qualified graduates, we\u2019re part of Europe but we\u2019re English speaking, we\u2019re a really good bridge between the US and Europe, and I think those are the key things that make us a real sweet spot,\u201d he said.\nThe Elfordstown Earthstation, where the National Space Centre now operates, was strategically based in Midleton in the 1980s because of particular advantages to the Cork location.Originally built as a pan-European project to transmit telephone calls via satellite between Europe and the US, Ireland was the natural choice for the teleport, as the EU country that looked further west than anywhere else.With better visibility to satellites in the south of the country, Cork was chosen for its particularly good infrastructure, and the natural dip in the landscape around Midleton proved quiet for radio noise.Mr Fitzpatrick said that Cork is still to this day a good location for space-related industry, for all the reasons it was singled out in the 1980s, added to the fact that large corporations with a likely interest in evolving space tech, like Apple, are already based here.Having taken over the Elfordstown Earthstation in 2010, the National Space Centre now uses the facility for both commercial broadcasting and teleport services to communicate with satellites, and commercial contracts for research and development.Mr Fitzpatrick said the centre is currently in discussions with a number of commercial partners to fund the refurbishment of \u201cThe Big Dish\u201d at the station, for communication to the moon and Mars. Rory Fitzpatrick, CEO of the National Space Centre Ltd near Midleton, Co Cork. Picture: David Keane.He said that the boost from commercial investment in Cork\u2019s space sector fills the gap that State investment can\u2019t meet.\u201cThe difficulty for us is that the Irish Government\u2019s budget for space is too small, so they can\u2019t afford infrastructure projects\u2026 They couldn\u2019t put money into us because we\u2019d need all the Irish budget in one fell swoop, so our only option really is commercial business,\u201d he said.\u201cFor the last 10 years, we\u2019ve brought some of the top space companies in the world into Ireland to operate stuff to satellite from Cork,\u201d he added, noting that space companies such as theirs based in Cork have \u201cexciting\u201d opportunities in the commercial world.Mr Fitzpatrick has seen a huge increase in interest in the space industry amongst young entrepreneurs, and said the National Space Centre hopes to host a special event in the new year to give them a head start.\u201cComing out of lockdown, and everything else that\u2019s gone on, you have a lot of young people who just want to get out and do stuff\u2026 there\u2019s a massive amount of 20-something young people starting space companies, and they\u2019re doing everything; space breathing apparatus, space suits, everything you can imagine they\u2019re making up, they\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said.\u201cIn the new year we\u2019re going to hold a space start-up event for young people that are interested in starting up space companies.

          "Last month, the massive cryptocurrency exchange known as FTX imploded, filing for bankruptcy and sending a ripple through the digital economy \u2014 especially in Alberta, a province that had posited itself as a possible leader in the space.  It's likely few companies were watching FTX's collapse with more interest than the Calgary-based trading platform Bitvo Inc., which FTX announced it was planning to acquire in June. In light of the collapse, Bitvo announced last month the deal had been terminated, adding it had no material exposure to FTX and was not party to the bankruptcy proceedings. \"There's no impact on Bitvo's operations, or the security of our customers' funds, as a result of the FTX failure,\" said Pamela Draper, president and CEO of Bitvo. But the domino effect of the collapse of FTX, once valued at $32 billion US, has put the cryptocurrency industry on its heels for the year ahead and has posed some existential questions for an emerging space that the Alberta government has hailed as a big opportunity for diversification. It was the moves the province took to position itself as a potential leader in the cryptocurrency space that attracted FTX to start building its Canadian presence in Alberta in the first place, according to the founder of the Bahamas-headquartered exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried. \"We've had some fantastic conversations with the Government of Alberta, which has been really constructive and is trying to take the lead in Canada and around the world for crypto policy and frameworks,\" Bankman-Fried said in an interview with the Globe and Mail in June. Bankman-Fried was charged earlier this month with eight criminal violations and could face decades in prison. Proponents of the technology, including those who run businesses based in Alberta, argue the market has been through cycles such as this one before, and say FTX's collapse presents an opportunity to turn the page and further develop the underlying blockchain technology. Critics, meanwhile, say its implosion presents more evidence that blockchain technology has again failed in a significant way, and that more difficult challenges are coming in the year ahead. Hut 8, based in Medicine Hat, Alta., bills itself as being one of Canada's oldest and largest miners, and says it isn't concerned about the latest downtrend in the space. \"This is not our first bear market,\" said Sue Ennis, head of investor relations at Hut 8. \"In the last bull market of 2021, we were one of the only guys who were actually setting ourselves up and setting up our balance sheet so that we could weather any sort of storm.\" Ennis said the company plans to hang on to its 8,925 bitcoins, believing in its future upside as an asset class and the ability to build businesses on top of the asset. Koleya Karringten is executive director of the Canadian Blockchain Consortium, a Calgary-based national industry group that advocates for regulation around cryptocurrency. She said though most news around the blockchain industry has been negative in recent months, in her view it failed to recognize developments in its underlying technology, including in Canada. \"[The industry is] developing out technology that's capable of being exported internationally and supporting everything from remittance payments to better transparency and a more secure supply chain for everything from pharmaceuticals to our energy industry to agriculture,\" Karringten said.  The Alberta government, meanwhile, isn't planning on making any changes to a bill it passed in the spring, when the price of bitcoin was relatively stable. That bill temporarily lets cryptocurrency and other financial technology companies be temporarily exempted from some financial laws as they test products in Alberta, as long as they meet certain terms. Beyond cryptocurrency, the so-called \"fintech\" ecosystem includes businesses like credit unions and loan and trust corporations. The province is the first in Canada to test out such a regulatory sandbox. Others are less optimistic about the year to come and argue that FTX's collapse is just the latest in a long line of bad news for the crypto space in 2022. Paris Marx, host of the Tech Won't Save Us podcast, said the past year has shown that big claims being made about the cryptocurrency industry were \"very much overblown.\" \"I think we need to stop being distracted by these delusions of what cryptocurrency can offer, and actually be real about what it takes to build an economy for the future that is going to be beneficial to people, rather than just getting excited about the next kind of tech bubble,\" Marx said. The downturn in the crypto space has led to layoffs over the past year, including at the Canada-based Wealthsimple, which laid off 13 per cent of its staff earlier this year. Marx said FTX's implosion further destabilizes trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. \"People started to withdraw their crypto or tried to cash out, effectively creating like a bank run on these cryptocurrencies,\" Marx said. \"That shows that the fundamentals, the foundations of this industry, were flawed from the very beginning.\" Meanwhile, the advent of blockchain technology has led to an upsurge of work for some outside the traditional space. Matthew Burgoyne is a Calgary-based corporate and securities lawyer at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP who advises in regulator matters, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and other areas geared toward the cryptocurrency and blockchain Web3 space. \"I think it's a booming business for lawyers because there's still a lot of regulatory uncertainty in the market,\" Burgoyne said. \"There could very well be new legislation passed in the coming years that directly affects cryptocurrency businesses. So that is a big area of growth for lawyers.\"  Joel is a reporter/editor with CBC Calgary. In fall 2021, he ran CBC's bureau in Lethbridge.

          "China launched a Long March 3B carrier rocket on Thursday afternoon to transport an experimental satellite into space, completing the busiest year in terms of launch numbers for the country's space industry. The rocket blasted off at 12:43 pm at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan province and then deployed the Shiyan 10-02 experimental satellite into a preset orbit, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the nation's leading space contractor, said in a news release. The satellite will have the task of demonstrating new technologies for space environmental monitoring and other purposes. The launch marked the 53rd flight of the Long March rocket family this year and the 458th since the large fleet's debut flight in 1970. It also is the 64th space mission by China this year. The company said the flight is the last task for the Long March rocket fleet this year. Among the Long March flights in 2022, the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology carried out 30, while 23 were made by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. Both are subsidiaries of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. Multiple sources inside China's space industry confirmed on Thursday that there will be no other launches in the country this year. This was the first time that China conducted more than 60 rocket liftoffs in a year. Long Lehao, a top rocket scientist at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, said on Thursday that about 27 percent of all Long March flights this year were undertaken by new types of rockets developed in recent years. \"The fact that new-generation rockets have been widely used represents a big leap in our research, development and production capabilities in the carrier rocket field,\" he said. Zhu Liangcong, a chief structural designer of rockets at the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, said that rocket models made at the academy are mainly used to deploy satellites to low orbits. \"The rapidly expanding business of low-orbit satellite networks in China has led to a rising demand for rockets to send satellites, thus giving us more orders,\" he said. The Long March 2D model, a product of the Shanghai academy, made 15 liftoffs this year, becoming the busiest of all Chinese rockets by the number of annual flights, according to Zhu. In 2021, China conducted 55 space launches, with the Long March series carrying out 48 of them. The final launch last year was also made by the Long March 3B model. China launched more carrier rockets than any other country in 2018, 2019 and 2021. The United States, which was the second-largest user of rockets those years, has conducted 86 launches so far this year. China launched its first carrier rocket \u2014 a Long March 1 that was a modified ballistic missile \u2014 in April 1970 to send its first satellite, Dongfanghong 1, into space. The mission made China the fifth country capable of building and launching its own carrier rocket to reach Earth orbit. Since then, the country has developed and launched nearly 30 types of carrier rockets, most of them part of the Long March series. Currently, there are 22 models of carrier rockets in service in China, 16 of which are in the Long March family. zhaolei@chinadaily.com.cn \n            Copyright 1995 -  . All rights reserved.

          "The Artemis I unmanned lunar rocket lifts off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, last month. Photograph: Gregg Newton / AFP via Getty Images  An Irish company will provide one of the software cornerstones for a space station orbiting the moon that Nasa and the European Space Agency hope to establish following the recent successful launch of Nasa\u2019s Artemis rocket. Dublin-based Skytek has been awarded a contract by the agency to provide flight support software for the Gateway space station. That orbiting platform is not intended to be constantly crewed, like the international space station orbiting Earth. Instead, it will be a kind of lunar Airbnb, with crews working for three or four-month stints in lunar orbit, assisting manned missions to the surface, and eventually providing support for missions to Mars. Dr Sarah Bourke, Skytek\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe awarding of this contract is testimony to the skill and excellence of our technical team. Working in the space sector has afforded us the opportunity to work at the leading edge of science and technology. We have taken this knowledge and successfully transferred it to other sectors including insurance and security.\u201d Skytek\u2019s contribution to Gateway will be a software system to help astronauts with the day-to-day operations of the station, building on the wealth of knowledge accumulated from running the international space station. Skytek\u2019s international procedural viewer technology is already in orbit on the space station, and will form the basis of the Gateway project.

          "Get the latest industry news first when you subscribe to our daily newsletter. MedCity Influencers, Devices & Diagnostics \nBy Chuck Serrin\n  Customers are at the center of business, and in the medical technology space quality assurance reigns supreme. Quality assurance looks at a company\u2019s services or products to make sure everything is running efficiently and up to par with what is desired and mandated by an industry. When this process is streamlined, quality assurance provides a significant benefit to both the consumer and the business. For a company, quality assurance provides an opportunity to create efficiency in the business model. For customers in the medtech space, quality assurance can improve patient safety, effectiveness and user experiences, while also ensuring they are getting necessary outcomes at a fast and accurate pace. Improving user experience with products can then translate into loyalty for the brand. When companies know what customers want, they can use that to innovate and keep people coming back for more. Innovation is key. The customer is number one. Without innovation everything is stagnant. Nothing evolves. Nothing improves. In the medical field where everything constantly changes, innovation is of utmost importance. One way to figure out what could be the next big innovation is to listen to your customers. Monitoring customer feedback and vigilance about a product goes both ways. It can be positive or it can be negative. Both are useful for the business to hear. A business can take that input and then make adjustments to the product to better optimize the user experience. In addition, customer feedback is an integral part of quality control checks. In medtech, feedback is crucial. It is important that all medical devices and technologies work properly and efficiently for the user. A business wants \u2013 and needs \u2013 to know what is working and what isn\u2019t. If your customer is using a hearing aid, and it breaks after a few uses, there could be a structural issue with the specific device, or it could be a bigger manufacturing problem. Being able to listen to that feedback, pinpoint the problem, and look into a solution is important. Having that direct line of feedback to make necessary adjustments is a win-win for the customer and the business. Is it functioning at the high level that it was designed in the research and development (R&D) to achieve including user needs? What can be improved to better satisfy and improve patient outcomes? Did one part of the device malfunction or break? Can that malfunctioning part be replaced, or is it a bigger manufacturing issue in the supply chain?  These are all necessary and important questions to address. Performing quality control checks on products is integral in the future developments of the products. Being able to control and streamline how a business will respond to changes will resolve issues quicker and more smoothly. Follow the regulatory mandates. Our environment is constantly changing. Technology is being updated, and new laws are being passed every day. It\u2019s important to make sure medical devices follow all regulatory mandates. Furthermore, quality R&D and regulatory oversight must work together in developing a product to make sure all needs are met. Having a well-documented product lifecycle can help streamline the process and keep everything in check from all angles. Businesses working in the medical device space must not only be financially compliant, but also regulatory agency compliant across the board. Regulatory compliance ensures products have been tested to make sure it\u2019s effective, safe and have the proper usage directions laid out for the customer. Following all mandates and government guidance is necessary and advised. Automation increases accuracy. Automation can lead to more accurate results by reducing variability and increasing the overall quality of the system. It can also help ensure your company stays compliant with regulatory mandates. If a business has an organized system, it can improve supplier management and help the business operate at an optimal level. All in all, quality assurance helps a business make sure its process meets the standards and regulations of an industry \u2013 a key component in medical technology. Having a streamlined process to get customer feedback, adhere to regulations, and automate processes not only helps make sure a business delivers the best quality products, but also helps ensure that customers are satisfied.

          " Copyright \u00a9 HT Media Limited  All rights reserved.  It's been an eventful year for space exploration, with successes including the completion of Nasa's Artemis 1 mission (finally), the inauguration of the James Webb Space Telescope, and the completion of China's Tiangong space station. 2023 is set to be another busy year. Here are five of the most exciting missions to watch out for. Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer In April, the European Space Agency (Esa) is set to launch the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), in what will be Europe's first dedicated robotic mission to Jupiter. Juice is due to reach the planet in July 2031 after performing an incredible flight path through the Solar System. The mission will enter into orbit around Jupiter and perform numerous flybys of its large icy moons: Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. After four years of moon flybys, Juice will then enter into orbit around Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System \u2013 becoming the first spacecraft ever to reach orbit around the moon of another planet. The icy moons of Jupiter are interesting as they are all believed to host oceans of liquid water beneath their frozen surfaces. Europa, in particular, is regarded as one of the most likely abodes in the Solar System for extra-terrestrial life. Juice will be equipped with ten scientific instruments including ice-penetrating radar to study the internal oceans. This use of radar is a practical first step in mapping the sub-surface oceans, paving the way for more exotic future missions involving submersible vehicles \u2013 some of which have already been put forward. The launch window runs from April 5 to April 25. SpaceX Starship Although no date has been announced by aerospace company SpaceX at the time of writing, the first orbital test flight of the super-heavy Starship spacecraft is highly anticipated to occur in early 2023. Starship will be the largest spacecraft capable of carrying humans from Earth to destinations in space (the International Space Station is larger, but it was assembled in space). It will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever to fly, capable of lifting 100 tonnes of cargo to low Earth orbit. Starship is the collective name for a two-component system consisting of the Starship spacecraft (which carries the crew and cargo) and the Super Heavy rocket. The rocket component will lift Starship to some 65km altitude before separating and returning to Earth in a controlled landing. The upper Starship component will then use its own engines to push itself the rest of the way to orbit. Several short test flights of the Starship portion of the system have been made with varying degrees of success. But the upcoming flight will be the first time the whole system will be used to reach space as one. This first orbital flight was originally scheduled to launch in September 2022, but has been delayed several times. dearMoon The long-awaited dearMoon project, which will take members of the public on a six-day trip around the Moon and back, is due for launch on Starship and was originally planned for 2023. The exact date will depend on the successful test of Starship, but has been on the books since 2018. It will be the first true deep space tourism launch. Financed by business entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, a competition was set up to select eight members of the public (and an unknown number of crew) to join Maezawa on the trip \u2013 all completely paid for. The winners and criteria used have not been disclosed, although it is suspected the guests may be established or aspiring artists. This mission will mark a big change in the way we think about space, as previously only astronauts picked using incredibly stringent criteria have been able to go into deep space (note: we are not counting brief 10-minute jaunts up to 100 km). A full trip of several days poses extreme risks, both in terms of health and engineering. The success or failure of the dearMoon mission could affect whether deep space tourism becomes the next big thing, or it is relegated back to being a pipe-dream. Asteroid explorer returns to Earth The Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security \u2013 Regolith Explorer, mercifully more commonly known as OSIRIS-REx, is a Nasa mission to near-Earth asteroid Bennu. A key goal of this robotic mission was to acquire samples of Bennu and return them to Earth for analysis. OSIRIS-REx is now fast returning to Earth with up to a kilogram of precious asteroid samples stored aboard. If all goes well, the capsule will detach from the spacecraft, enter the Earth's atmosphere and parachute to a soft landing in the deserts of Utah on September 24. Asteroid sample return has only been achieved once before, by the Japanese Space Agency's Hayabusa 2 mission in 2020. Bennu is an approximately diamond-shaped world just half a kilometre in size, but has many interesting characteristics. It is believed to have broken off from a much larger asteroid in the first 10 million years of the Solar System. Some of the minerals detected within it have been altered by water, implying that Bennu's ancient parent body possessed liquid water. It also has an abundance of precious metals, including gold and platinum. Finally, Bennu is classed as a potentially hazardous object with a (very) small possibility of Earth impact in the next century. India's private space launch While SpaceX is the most prominent private space launch company, there are many others developing their own series of launchers around the world. Skyroot Aerospace, which successfully launched its Vikram-S rocket in November 2022, is soon to become the first private Indian company to launch a satellite. The rocket itself reached 90km in altitude, a distance that would need to be improved upon to get a constellation of satellites into orbit. Skyroot's first satellite launch is planned for 2023, with a goal of undercutting the cost of private space launch rivals by producing its 3D-printed rockets in a matter of days. If successful, this could also provide a route for cheaper launches of scientific missions, enabling a faster rate of research. Clearly, interest in the space sector remains high. With many bold advances and launches due in 2023, we are entering a new phase akin to the \u201cGolden era\u201d of space launches in the 1960s and '70s.

          "Rhiannon Adam spent the first seven years of her life just outside the village of Ballinadee, while she describes places like Bandon, Courtmacsherry and Kinsale as her family's \"stomping ground\". Picture: projectMoon Cork-born photographer Rhiannon Adam will be the first Irish person to travel into space when she takes one of eight seats on the first civilian trip to the Moon next year. Onboard Starship, a rocket being developed by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and funded by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa (known as MZ), Rhiannon will circle the Moon for seven days with seven other creatives all tasked with developing a unique art project inspired by the experience. Born in Cork in 1985, Rhiannon spent the first seven years of her life just outside the village of Ballinadee, while she describes places like Bandon, Courtmacsherry and Kinsale as her family's \"stomping ground\". Family adventure She was always \"game for an adventure\", she tells the  Irish Examiner, probably because her family sold up their home in 1992 and started an eight-year long sea escapade. Rhiannon's father had been on a trip at sea, \"sort of connected to Greenpeace in the Azores\", she says. After he returned the family then went to sea having seen an ad on a pub noticeboard in Kinsale. \"After dad came back we were just wandering past and saw this notice from this Dutch single-handed sailor who wanted to settle down and so he was selling the boat he had built himself.  \"We didn't really have any money at the time, but we sold our house we were in and we basically put a price tag on literally everything we owned. We had an open house, we told everyone we knew and people wandered in and lifted up objects and said: '50p? A pound?'. It was a massive clear-out. I was seven when we left,\" says the now Hackney-based photographer, who also splits her time between America as well as London. The plan, or \"deal\" that was struck with the young Rhiannon was that they'd be back in Cork in time for her to start secondary school. The plan never materialised. \"We kind of made a pact that we'd be back by the time I was 12, it just never really panned out that way, but that was the deal that was cut with me, that we'd be back in Ireland by the time I was 12, so that I could go to school, but life happened and it just didn't end up that way. \"I ended up in London after I couldn't handle the boat anymore. My parents split up when I was in the Caribbean, so my mum ended up in America and my dad now lives in Thailand, so we are all spread,\" says Rhiannon. \"It was almost eight years at sea,\" she adds. Creative beginnings When she landed in London, she went on to attend the famous Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the University of Cambridge, where she studied arts, design and environment, and English literature respectively. Was she always set on a career in photography? It was art first - she won a prize at national school, in Bandon Bridge, an award that still thrills her to this day. \"I always wanted to be an artist. I won the art prize in 1991 in Bandon Bridge and I was so thrilled, I always wanted to be an artist - that was my life goal,\" says Rhiannon. Read MoreCork woman joining Japanese billionaire on first civilian flight to moon\n In school in England she ran the photography society, had the key to the dark room and slowly became immersed in this \"creative culture\". \"I was very off-kilter as a teenager because I had this weird life, I don't think I fit in terribly well. I knew I was gay very young and I went off to gay clubs and things and I think I sort of absorbed that creative culture, that outsider community in a way,\" says Rhiannon, who now travels to far-flung places to photograph unique ways of life. It is this eye for the extraordinary and the lasting impact of a childhood spent at sea that has prepared her for space travel. She describes the boat as \"claustrophobic\", something most astronauts say about the living quarters of a spaceship.  Her nomadic early life also left her with a feeling of being an \"outsider\", something you imagine a human looking down at Earth from space may feel. \"I didn't have the most pleasurable experience on the boat. I'm not going to lie to you and say it was brilliant. It's very stressful being in that environment, it's claustrophobic and you also don't belong to the place you're in. \"You're part of this outsider community. You drop into a place and you kind of live there for a time but you can't really lay down any roots there, so it's hard for you to go to school, it's hard to make commitments to anywhere. You're always half in and half out,\" says Rhiannon. Lunar voyage But when it comes to the Moon there is no feeling other than excitement at play, especially not fear. \"There's a personal poll I've been running, and it's totally 50/50 with people who are like: 'absolutely, I would never do that, ever' and the other people are like: 'please can you take me, just take a picture of me and take it up to the Moon. Can I give you something to take?' You would not believe my inbox right now from requests,\" says Rhiannon. \"There are some people who would just do anything, they would give their right arm. I'm not afraid in any sense. I've done a lot of scary things in life and I think the more scary things are the things you don't expect to be frightening. \nSome of the circumstances I found myself in in life, with humans generally, are much more terrifying than the idea of technological failure. I'm not afraid of that.\n Rhiannon saw the dearMoon project announced on Twitter in March 2021, and along with more than one million other people from a total of 249 countries, applied. Following the initial application process, there was a lengthy selection process with everything from health checks to having to give \"informed consent\". With lift-off planned for 2023, is there any special diet or exercise she must undertake in order to prepare? \"I would love to tell you that I was on some strict diet and I would love to tell you that I had turned over a new leaf and I was now an exercise fiend but if I did I think I would give a few people a premature heart attack. \"I just eat what I have always eaten. I do the same exercise I have always done which is zero,\" says Rhiannon.

And when she's up in space on the Starship will she look down at Earth, and of all the places she's been, will Ireland feel like home? \"It's an interesting one with Ireland because for most of my life if you'd asked me, like 100% I was Irish. I was singing Irish football songs, I always support Ireland, it's always been Ireland,\" says Rhiannon. \"I have a very deep connection to Ireland, and such affection for it and I've been back quite a few times and I've still got lots of friends I go and visit. I'm very connected to it but it's not where I live right now. I live out of a suitcase mainly,\" she adds.  To follow her adventure see @rhiannon_adam on Instagram. Women in Space  2023 will mark 60 years since the first woman travelled to space. On June 16, 1963, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space. It would be nearly 20 years before another woman went into space, Russia's Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982. Of the more than 600 people who have travelled to space since Yuri Gagarin from the Soviet Union in 1961, 73 of them have been women as of April 2022 - about 12%.  However, very few of these have been European, with 55 coming from the United States, two from Canada, five from Russia and one from South Korea. Only a handful of European women have ever ventured into space, however, having said that, one of them now holds the top job.  European Women in Space  \nSamantha Cristoforetti - The TikTok Astronaut \n In September 2022, Samantha Cristoforetti officially became the first European woman to command the International Space Station (ISS). The 45-year-old Italian took over from Oleg Artemyev becoming the fifth European commander of the ISS after Frank De Winne, Alexander Gerst, Luca Parmitano and Thomas Pesquet. Cristoforetti studied mechanical engineering in Italy and then joined the Italian Air Force as a pilot before becoming captain. In 2009, she was selected by the European Space Agency to become Italy\u2019s first female astronaut. In 2015, she set a record by spending 200 days on a single mission in space, at the time the longest continuous space flight by a woman. The Italian astronaut has also become a cultural icon and uses social media platform TikTok to engage with people on Earth. \n Helen Sharman - \"It was a way out [of] the rat race\"\n  Helen Sharman, in May 1991, at just 27 years of age became the first British astronaut to travel into space, never mind woman. Called Project Juno, she travelled on a private British space programme. She was selected out of 13,000 candidates. It all started in 1989, when the civilian was driving home from her day job at Mars. She heard an ad on the radio: \u201cAstronaut wanted, no experience necessary.\u201d She says she \"leapt at the opportunity\" mostly spurred on by the training involved, time in Russia, learning the language and studying advanced mechanics. \"It was a way out [of] the rat race,\" she said. Sharman would go on to spend 18 months training to be an astronaut at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, Moscow, before going on to become Britain's first ever person in space.  Claudie Haigner\u00e9 - from space medicine to space travel  Doctor, politician and astronaut, Claudie Haigner\u00e9 became France's first woman in space in 1996. As part of her degree, Claudie would study aviation and space medicine in 1982, a module that would stand to her more than a decade later. While she was selected as a French candidate astronaut in 1985 by France\u2019s National Centre for Space Studies (CNES), she would spend most of her time medically supporting those already in space. From 1990 to 1992, she was responsible for French and international space physiology and medicine programmes in the CNES and from 1989 to 1992, she was responsible for the scientific co-ordination of the life sciences experiments aboard the 1992 Franco\u2013Russian Antar\u00e8s mission. In 1992, she was selected as a back-up cosmonaut and then finally in December 1994, she was assigned to the Cassiop\u00e9e mission as a research cosmonaut. Her 16-day mission took place from 17 August to 2 September 1996.

          "A hackathon challenged aerospace students to develop a detailed digital system model for a robotic assistant for astronauts on the Moon, able to identify key areas of interest in advance of any humans landing, guide them to their habitat and even rescue any moonwalkers in distress. The winning team, from France\u2019s Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019A\u00e9ronautique et de l\u2019Espace, completed their task within just two weeks, using Model Based System Engineering to do so. This method involves creating digital models of space missions to manage their design, construction, test and operation \u2013 and has been highlighted by ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher as key to the future of the Agency, and Europe\u2019s wider competitiveness in space. The results of the 10-team hackathon, supported by Thales and French space agency CNES, were presented at this year\u2019s Model Based Space Systems and Software Engineering workshop, MBSE2022, which took place at the Airbus Leadership Academy in Toulouse, co-organised by ESA, Airbus and CNES. This annual event presents the work of the Model Based for System Engineering Advisory Group (MB4SE), a multidisciplinary team of experts from ESA, national space agencies and industry, tasked with encouraging the use of Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) in the space sector. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher has made this a priority objective in his Agenda 2025: \u201cESA projects are characterized by heavy engineering efforts form geographically dispersed teams in ESA and industry. Digital continuity throughout the life cycle of projects allows the substantial reduction of cost and efforts, and will shorten schedules. ESA will therefore digitalise its full project management, enabling the development of digital twins, both for engineering by using Model Based System Engineering and for procurement and finance, achieving full continuity with industry.\u201d Spacecraft are among the most complex machines ever built, so systems engineering has always been an essential element in their realisation, focused on a space system as a whole rather than its individual subsystems. System engineers design the mission architecture, define a strategy for building and oversee the integration of its subsystems, as well as the verification and validation of the overall system. Traditional systems engineering for a mission is based around documentation. MBSE seeks to improve on that approach by using digital models instead to describe all the different subsystems and elements, and their relations with each other. Information that would usually be included in documents is instead expressed in a more structured and digitally processable way \u2013 as interactive diagrams, for example, rather than solely in the form of words. This allows it to be more easily processed and inspected, and used within different design and analysis software tools. The main benefit of this approach is the improvement in communication between all stakeholders. As soon as an update is made to the model then that change becomes accessible to everyone, immediately. The models can also be used to support the design and analysis, well before the system is being built. For example, virtual testing can be carried out in simulators far in advance of any physical hardware taking shape, and any lessons learned can be applied to optimise the design. The planning for testing and operations can also be guided by the model. A lot of data becomes generally accessible, rather than lost within individual disciplines or project phases, available for analysis using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to identify possible improvements, even to plan out procurement. Those attending MBSE2022 are tasked with making this ambituous vision happen: More than 300 engineers gathered in person, along with another hundred remote attendees, for about 50 presentations, addressing the broad diversity of the European space community. Among the key challenges under discussion was the need to create a standardised categorisation system defining the properties of all system elements and the relations between them \u2013 to enable interoperability along the digital workflow, allowing different software tools to work on the same data. A quartet of keynote speakers dealt with this and other challenges, with contributions from the International Council on Systems Engineering, Thales, Airbus and ESA itself. Pierrik Vuilleumier of the Agency\u2019s Earth Observation Programmes Department highlighted the fact that many ESA missions in development are already making use of MBSE. One early pioneer was ESA Clean Space\u2019s e.Deorbit mission, intended to retrieve space debris, which did not progress to its production phase but has a successor in the form of the commercial ClearSpace-1 mission, also using MBSE, due to remove part of a Vega launcher upper stage from orbit in 2025. Euclid \u2013 tasked with mapping the large scale geometry of the Universe to cast light on dark matter and dark energy \u2013 was ESA Science\u2019s early adopter, subsequently joined by the exoplanet-detecting Plato and EnVision mission to Venus. And the Agency\u2019s TRUTHS mission, planned to measure incoming solar radiation and of radiation reflected from Earth back out into space, is a pioneer on the Earth Observation side. Other large scale programmes harnessing MBSE include Moonlight \u2013 a constellation of lunar satellites to bring telecommunications and navigation services to the Moon \u2013 and Galileo Second Generation, as well as ESA\u2019s Earth Return Orbiter of the international Mars Sample Return programme. The same is true of ESA\u2019s contributions to the lunar Gateway and the Argonaut European Lunar Logistics Lander, for pinpoint landing of supplies to the Moon. ESA is supporting this work with multiple research activities within its Discovery and Preparation programme, including more than 80 projects to date proposed through its open-to-everyone Open Space Innovation Platform, illustrating the wide interest in digitalisation as the future of space engineering.

This method involves creating digital models of space missions to manage their design, construction, test and operation \u2013 and has been highlighted by ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher as key to the future of the Agency, and Europe\u2019s wider competitiveness in space.\nThe results of the 10-team hackathon, supported by Thales and French space agency CNES, were presented at this year\u2019s Model Based Space Systems and Software Engineering workshop, MBSE2022, which took place at the Airbus Leadership Academy in Toulouse, co-organised by ESA, Airbus and CNES.\nThis annual event presents the work of the Model Based for System Engineering Advisory Group (MB4SE), a multidisciplinary team of experts from ESA, national space agencies and industry, tasked with encouraging the use of Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) in the space sector.\nESA Director General Josef Aschbacher has made this a priority objective in his Agenda 2025: \u201cESA projects are characterized by heavy engineering efforts form geographically dispersed teams in ESA and industry. Digital continuity throughout the life cycle of projects allows the substantial reduction of cost and efforts, and will shorten schedules. ESA will therefore digitalise its full project management, enabling the development of digital twins, both for engineering by using Model Based System Engineering and for procurement and finance, achieving full continuity with industry.\u201d\nSpacecraft are among the most complex machines ever built, so systems engineering has always been an essential element in their realisation, focused on a space system as a whole rather than its individual subsystems. System engineers design the mission architecture, define a strategy for building and oversee the integration of its subsystems, as well as the verification and validation of the overall system.\nTraditional systems engineering for a mission is based around documentation. MBSE seeks to improve on that approach by using digital models instead to describe all the different subsystems and elements, and their relations with each other. Information that would usually be included in documents is instead expressed in a more structured and digitally processable way \u2013 as interactive diagrams, for example, rather than solely in the form of words. This allows it to be more easily processed and inspected, and used within different design and analysis software tools.\nThe main benefit of this approach is the improvement in communication between all stakeholders. As soon as an update is made to the model then that change becomes accessible to everyone, immediately.\nThe models can also be used to support the design and analysis, well before the system is being built. For example, virtual testing can be carried out in simulators far in advance of any physical hardware taking shape, and any lessons learned can be applied to optimise the design. The planning for testing and operations can also be guided by the model. A lot of data becomes generally accessible, rather than lost within individual disciplines or project phases, available for analysis using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to identify possible improvements, even to plan out procurement.\nThose attending MBSE2022 are tasked with making this ambituous vision happen: More than 300 engineers gathered in person, along with another hundred remote attendees, for about 50 presentations, addressing the broad diversity of the European space community.\nAmong the key challenges under discussion was the need to create a standardised categorisation system defining the properties of all system elements and the relations between them \u2013 to enable interoperability along the digital workflow, allowing different software tools to work on the same data.\nA quartet of keynote speakers dealt with this and other challenges, with contributions from the International Council on Systems Engineering, Thales, Airbus and ESA itself.

          "By Colin Jacobs and Karl Glazebrook, Swinburne University of Technology\nDecember 29, 2022What looks much like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening is actually the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. Captured in infrared light by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, this image reveals previously obscured areas of star birth. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScIIt is no exaggeration to say the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) represents a new era for modern astronomy.Launched on December 25 last year and fully operational since July, the telescope offers glimpses of the universe that were inaccessible to us before. Like the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST is in space, so it can take pictures with stunning detail free from the distortions of Earth\u2019s atmosphere.However, while Hubble is in orbit around Earth at an altitude of 335 miles (540 km), the JWST is 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) distant, far beyond the Moon. From this position, away from the interference of our planet\u2019s reflected heat, it can collect light from across the universe far into the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.This ability, when combined with the JWST\u2019s larger mirror, state-of-the-art detectors, and many other technological advances, allows astronomers to look back to the universe\u2019s earliest epochs.As the universe expands, it stretches the wavelength of light traveling toward us, making more distant objects appear redder. At great enough distances, the light from a galaxy is shifted entirely out of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum to the infrared. The JWST is able to probe such sources of light right back to the earliest times, nearly 14 billion years ago.The Hubble telescope continues to be a great scientific instrument and can see at optical wavelengths where the JWST cannot. But the Webb telescope can see much further into the infrared with greater sensitivity and sharpness.Let\u2019s have a look at ten images that have demonstrated the staggering power of this new window to the universe.1. Mirror alignment completeLeft: The first publicly released alignment image from the JWST. Astronomers jumped on this image to compare it to previous images of the same part of sky like that on the right from the Dark Energy Camera on Earth. Credit: NASA/STScI/LegacySurvey/C. JacobsDespite years of testing on the ground, an observatory as complex as the JWST required extensive configuration and testing once deployed in the cold and dark of space.One of the biggest tasks was getting the 18 hexagonal mirror segments unfolded and aligned to within a fraction of a wavelength of light. In March, NASA released the first image (centered on a star) from the fully aligned mirror. Although it was just a calibration image, astronomers immediately compared it to existing images of that patch of sky \u2013 with considerable excitement.2. Spitzer vs MIRIThis image shows a portion of the \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019 in the infrared (see below); on the left taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and JWST on the right. The contrast in depth and resolution is dramatic. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech (left), NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI (right)This early image, taken while all the cameras were being focused, clearly demonstrates the step change in data quality that JWST brings over its predecessors.On the left is an image from the Spitzer telescope, a space-based infrared observatory with an 85 cm mirror; the right, the same field from JWST\u2019s mid-infrared MIRI camera and 6.5 m mirror. The resolution and ability to detect much fainter sources are on show here, with hundreds of galaxies visible that were lost in the noise of the Spitzer image. This is what a bigger mirror situated out in the deepest, coldest dark can do.3. The first galaxy cluster imageSMACS 0723 galaxy cluster \u2013 from Hubble on the left, and JWST on the right. Hundreds more galaxies are visible in JWST\u2019s infrared image. Credit: NASA/STSciThe galaxy cluster with the prosaic name of SMACS J0723.3\u20137327 was a good choice for the first color images released to the public from the JWST.The field is crowded with galaxies of all shapes and colors. The combined mass of this enormous galaxy cluster, over 4 billion light years away, bends space in such a way that light from distant sources in the background is stretched and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.These distorted background galaxies can be clearly seen as lines and arcs throughout this image. The field is already spectacular in Hubble images (left), but the JWST near-infrared image (right) reveals a wealth of extra detail, including hundreds of distant galaxies too faint or too red to be detected by its predecessor.4. Stephan\u2019s QuintetHubble (left) and JWST (right) images of the group of galaxies known as \u2018Stephan\u2019s Quintet\u2019. The inset shows a zoom-in on a distant background galaxy. Credit: NASA/STScIThese images depict a spectacular group of galaxies known as Stephan\u2019s Quintet, a group that has long been of interest to astronomers studying the way colliding galaxies interact with one another gravitationally.On the left we see the Hubble view, and the right the JWST mid-infrared view. The inset shows the power of the new telescope, with a zoom in on a small background galaxy. In the Hubble image we see some bright star-forming regions, but only with the JWST does the full structure of this and surrounding galaxies reveal itself.5. The Pillars of CreationThe \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019, a star-forming region of our galaxy, as captured by Hubble (left) and JWST (right). Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Anton M. Koekemoer (STScI), Alyssa Pagan (STScI).The so-called Pillars of Creation is one of the most famous images in all of astronomy, taken by Hubble in 1995. It demonstrated the extraordinary reach of a space-based telescope.It depicts a star-forming region in the Eagle Nebula, where interstellar gas and dust provide the backdrop to a stellar nursery teeming with new stars. The image on the right, taken with the JWST\u2019s near-infrared camera (NIRCam), demonstrates a further advantage of infrared astronomy: the ability to peer through the shroud of dust and see what lies within and behind.6. The \u2018Hourglass\u2019 ProtostarThe \u2018hourglass protostar\u2019, a star still in the process of accreting enough gas to begin fusing hydrogen. Inset: A much lower resolution view from Spitzer. Credit: NASA/STScI/JPL-Caltech/A. TobinThis image depicts another act of galactic creation within the Milky Way. This hourglass-shaped structure is a cloud of dust and gas surrounding a star in the act of formation \u2013 a protostar called L1527.Only visible in the infrared, an \u201caccretion disk\u201d of material falling in (the black band in the center) will eventually enable the protostar to gather enough mass to start fusing hydrogen, and a new star will be born.In the meantime, light from the still-forming star illuminates the gas above and below the disk, making the hourglass shape. Our previous view of this came from Spitzer; the amount of detail is once again an enormous leap ahead.7. Jupiter in infraredAn infrared view of Jupiter from the JWST. Note the auroral glow at the poles; this is caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun with Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.The Webb telescope\u2019s mission includes imaging the most distant galaxies from the beginning of the universe, but it can look a little closer to home as well.Although JWST cannot look at Earth or the inner Solar System planets \u2013 as it must always face away from the Sun \u2013 it can look outward at the more distant parts of our Solar System. This near-infrared image of Jupiter is a beautiful example, as we gaze deep into the structure of the gas giant\u2019s clouds and storms. The glow of auroras at both the northern and southern poles is haunting.This image was extremely difficult to achieve due to the fast motion of Jupiter across the sky relative to the stars and because of its fast rotation. The success proved the Webb telescope\u2019s ability to track difficult astronomical targets extremely well.8. The Phantom GalaxyHubble visible light (left), JWST infrared (right), and combined (middle) images of the \u2018Phantom Galaxy\u2019 M74. The ability to combine visible light information about stars with infrared images of gas and dust allow us to probe such galaxies in exquisite detail. Credit: ESA/Webb, NASA & CSA, J. Lee and the PHANGS-JWST Team; ESA/Hubble & NASA, R. Chandar Acknowledgement: J. SchmidtThese images of the so-called Phantom Galaxy or M74 reveal the power of JWST not only as the latest and greatest of astronomical instruments, but as a valuable complement to other great tools. The middle panel here combines visible light from Hubble with infrared from Webb, allowing us to see how starlight (via Hubble) and gas and dust (via JWST) together shape this remarkable galaxy.Much JWST science is designed to be combined with Hubble\u2019s optical views and other imaging to leverage this principle.9. A super-distant galaxyA \u2018zoom in\u2019 on a galaxy from one of the universe\u2019s earliest epochs, when the universe was only about 300 million years old (the small red source visible in the centre of the right panel). Galaxies at this distance are impossible to detect in visible light as their emitted radiation has been \u2018redshifted\u2019 far into the infrared. Credit: NASA/STScI/C. JacobsAlthough this galaxy \u2013 the small, red blob in the right image \u2013 is not among the most spectacularly picturesque our universe has to offer, it is just as interesting scientifically.This snapshot is from when the universe was a mere 350 million years old, making this among the very first galaxies ever to have formed. Understanding the details of how such galaxies grow and merge to create galaxies like our own Milky Way 13 billion years later is a key question, and one with many remaining mysteries, making discoveries like this highly sought after.It is also a view only the JWST can achieve. Astronomers did not know quite what to expect; an image of this galaxy taken with Hubble would appear blank, as the light of the galaxy is stretched far into the infrared by the expansion of the universe.10. This giant mosaic of Abell 2744An image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 created by combining many different JWST exposures. In this tiny part of the sky (a fraction of a full Moon) almost every one of the thousands of objects shown is a distant galaxy. Credit: Lukas Furtak (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) from images from the GLASS/UNCOVER teamsThis image is a mosaic (many individual images stitched together) centered on the giant Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, colloquially known as \u201cPandora\u2019s Cluster.\u201d The sheer number and variety of sources that the JWST can detect is mind-boggling; with the exception of a handful of foreground stars, every spot of light represents an entire galaxy.In a patch of dark sky no larger than a fraction of the full Moon there are umpteen thousands of galaxies, really bringing home the sheer scale of the universe we inhabit. Professional and amateur astronomers alike can spend hours scouring this image for oddities and mysteries.Over the coming years, JWST\u2019s ability to look so deep and far back into the universe will allow us to answer many questions about how we came to be. Just as exciting are the discoveries and questions we can not yet foresee. When you peel back the veil of time as only this new telescope can, these unknown unknowns are certain to be fascinating.Written by:Colin Jacobs \u2013 Postdoctoral Researcher in Astrophysics, Swinburne University of TechnologyKarl Glazebrook \u2013 ARC Laureate Fellow & Distinguished Professor, Centre for Astrophysics & Supercomputing, Swinburne University of TechnologyThis article was first published in The Conversation.

Launched on December 25 last year and fully operational since July, the telescope offers glimpses of the universe that were inaccessible to us before. Like the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST is in space, so it can take pictures with stunning detail free from the distortions of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, while Hubble is in orbit around Earth at an altitude of 335 miles (540 km), the JWST is 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) distant, far beyond the Moon. From this position, away from the interference of our planet\u2019s reflected heat, it can collect light from across the universe far into the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.This ability, when combined with the JWST\u2019s larger mirror, state-of-the-art detectors, and many other technological advances, allows astronomers to look back to the universe\u2019s earliest epochs.As the universe expands, it stretches the wavelength of light traveling toward us, making more distant objects appear redder. At great enough distances, the light from a galaxy is shifted entirely out of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum to the infrared. The JWST is able to probe such sources of light right back to the earliest times, nearly 14 billion years ago.The Hubble telescope continues to be a great scientific instrument and can see at optical wavelengths where the JWST cannot. But the Webb telescope can see much further into the infrared with greater sensitivity and sharpness.Let\u2019s have a look at ten images that have demonstrated the staggering power of this new window to the universe.1. Mirror alignment completeLeft: The first publicly released alignment image from the JWST. Astronomers jumped on this image to compare it to previous images of the same part of sky like that on the right from the Dark Energy Camera on Earth. Credit: NASA/STScI/LegacySurvey/C. JacobsDespite years of testing on the ground, an observatory as complex as the JWST required extensive configuration and testing once deployed in the cold and dark of space.One of the biggest tasks was getting the 18 hexagonal mirror segments unfolded and aligned to within a fraction of a wavelength of light. In March, NASA released the first image (centered on a star) from the fully aligned mirror. Although it was just a calibration image, astronomers immediately compared it to existing images of that patch of sky \u2013 with considerable excitement.2. Spitzer vs MIRIThis image shows a portion of the \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019 in the infrared (see below); on the left taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and JWST on the right. The contrast in depth and resolution is dramatic. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech (left), NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI (right)This early image, taken while all the cameras were being focused, clearly demonstrates the step change in data quality that JWST brings over its predecessors.On the left is an image from the Spitzer telescope, a space-based infrared observatory with an 85 cm mirror; the right, the same field from JWST\u2019s mid-infrared MIRI camera and 6.5 m mirror. The resolution and ability to detect much fainter sources are on show here, with hundreds of galaxies visible that were lost in the noise of the Spitzer image. This is what a bigger mirror situated out in the deepest, coldest dark can do.3. The first galaxy cluster imageSMACS 0723 galaxy cluster \u2013 from Hubble on the left, and JWST on the right. Hundreds more galaxies are visible in JWST\u2019s infrared image. Credit: NASA/STSciThe galaxy cluster with the prosaic name of SMACS J0723.3\u20137327 was a good choice for the first color images released to the public from the JWST.The field is crowded with galaxies of all shapes and colors. The combined mass of this enormous galaxy cluster, over 4 billion light years away, bends space in such a way that light from distant sources in the background is stretched and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.These distorted background galaxies can be clearly seen as lines and arcs throughout this image. The field is already spectacular in Hubble images (left), but the JWST near-infrared image (right) reveals a wealth of extra detail, including hundreds of distant galaxies too faint or too red to be detected by its predecessor.4. Stephan\u2019s QuintetHubble (left) and JWST (right) images of the group of galaxies known as \u2018Stephan\u2019s Quintet\u2019. The inset shows a zoom-in on a distant background galaxy. Credit: NASA/STScIThese images depict a spectacular group of galaxies known as Stephan\u2019s Quintet, a group that has long been of interest to astronomers studying the way colliding galaxies interact with one another gravitationally.On the left we see the Hubble view, and the right the JWST mid-infrared view. The inset shows the power of the new telescope, with a zoom in on a small background galaxy. In the Hubble image we see some bright star-forming regions, but only with the JWST does the full structure of this and surrounding galaxies reveal itself.5. The Pillars of CreationThe \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019, a star-forming region of our galaxy, as captured by Hubble (left) and JWST (right). Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Anton M. Koekemoer (STScI), Alyssa Pagan (STScI).The so-called Pillars of Creation is one of the most famous images in all of astronomy, taken by Hubble in 1995. It demonstrated the extraordinary reach of a space-based telescope.It depicts a star-forming region in the Eagle Nebula, where interstellar gas and dust provide the backdrop to a stellar nursery teeming with new stars. The image on the right, taken with the JWST\u2019s near-infrared camera (NIRCam), demonstrates a further advantage of infrared astronomy: the ability to peer through the shroud of dust and see what lies within and behind.6. The \u2018Hourglass\u2019 ProtostarThe \u2018hourglass protostar\u2019, a star still in the process of accreting enough gas to begin fusing hydrogen. Inset: A much lower resolution view from Spitzer. Credit: NASA/STScI/JPL-Caltech/A. TobinThis image depicts another act of galactic creation within the Milky Way. This hourglass-shaped structure is a cloud of dust and gas surrounding a star in the act of formation \u2013 a protostar called L1527.Only visible in the infrared, an \u201caccretion disk\u201d of material falling in (the black band in the center) will eventually enable the protostar to gather enough mass to start fusing hydrogen, and a new star will be born.In the meantime, light from the still-forming star illuminates the gas above and below the disk, making the hourglass shape. Our previous view of this came from Spitzer; the amount of detail is once again an enormous leap ahead.7. Jupiter in infraredAn infrared view of Jupiter from the JWST. Note the auroral glow at the poles; this is caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun with Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.The Webb telescope\u2019s mission includes imaging the most distant galaxies from the beginning of the universe, but it can look a little closer to home as well.Although JWST cannot look at Earth or the inner Solar System planets \u2013 as it must always face away from the Sun \u2013 it can look outward at the more distant parts of our Solar System. This near-infrared image of Jupiter is a beautiful example, as we gaze deep into the structure of the gas giant\u2019s clouds and storms. The glow of auroras at both the northern and southern poles is haunting.This image was extremely difficult to achieve due to the fast motion of Jupiter across the sky relative to the stars and because of its fast rotation. The success proved the Webb telescope\u2019s ability to track difficult astronomical targets extremely well.8. The Phantom GalaxyHubble visible light (left), JWST infrared (right), and combined (middle) images of the \u2018Phantom Galaxy\u2019 M74. The ability to combine visible light information about stars with infrared images of gas and dust allow us to probe such galaxies in exquisite detail. Credit: ESA/Webb, NASA & CSA, J. Lee and the PHANGS-JWST Team; ESA/Hubble & NASA, R. Chandar Acknowledgement: J. SchmidtThese images of the so-called Phantom Galaxy or M74 reveal the power of JWST not only as the latest and greatest of astronomical instruments, but as a valuable complement to other great tools. The middle panel here combines visible light from Hubble with infrared from Webb, allowing us to see how starlight (via Hubble) and gas and dust (via JWST) together shape this remarkable galaxy.Much JWST science is designed to be combined with Hubble\u2019s optical views and other imaging to leverage this principle.9. A super-distant galaxyA \u2018zoom in\u2019 on a galaxy from one of the universe\u2019s earliest epochs, when the universe was only about 300 million years old (the small red source visible in the centre of the right panel). Galaxies at this distance are impossible to detect in visible light as their emitted radiation has been \u2018redshifted\u2019 far into the infrared. Credit: NASA/STScI/C. JacobsAlthough this galaxy \u2013 the small, red blob in the right image \u2013 is not among the most spectacularly picturesque our universe has to offer, it is just as interesting scientifically.This snapshot is from when the universe was a mere 350 million years old, making this among the very first galaxies ever to have formed. Understanding the details of how such galaxies grow and merge to create galaxies like our own Milky Way 13 billion years later is a key question, and one with many remaining mysteries, making discoveries like this highly sought after.It is also a view only the JWST can achieve. Astronomers did not know quite what to expect; an image of this galaxy taken with Hubble would appear blank, as the light of the galaxy is stretched far into the infrared by the expansion of the universe.10.

Credit: Lukas Furtak (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) from images from the GLASS/UNCOVER teamsThis image is a mosaic (many individual images stitched together) centered on the giant Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, colloquially known as \u201cPandora\u2019s Cluster.\u201d The sheer number and variety of sources that the JWST can detect is mind-boggling; with the exception of a handful of foreground stars, every spot of light represents an entire galaxy.In a patch of dark sky no larger than a fraction of the full Moon there are umpteen thousands of galaxies, really bringing home the sheer scale of the universe we inhabit. Professional and amateur astronomers alike can spend hours scouring this image for oddities and mysteries.Over the coming years, JWST\u2019s ability to look so deep and far back into the universe will allow us to answer many questions about how we came to be. Just as exciting are the discoveries and questions we can not yet foresee. When you peel back the veil of time as only this new telescope can, these unknown unknowns are certain to be fascinating.Written by:Colin Jacobs \u2013 Postdoctoral Researcher in Astrophysics, Swinburne University of TechnologyKarl Glazebrook \u2013 ARC Laureate Fellow & Distinguished Professor, Centre for Astrophysics & Supercomputing, Swinburne University of TechnologyThis article was first published in The Conversation. Let\u2019s have a look at ten images that have demonstrated the staggering power of this new window to the universe.1. Mirror alignment completeLeft: The first publicly released alignment image from the JWST. Astronomers jumped on this image to compare it to previous images of the same part of sky like that on the right from the Dark Energy Camera on Earth. Credit: NASA/STScI/LegacySurvey/C. JacobsDespite years of testing on the ground, an observatory as complex as the JWST required extensive configuration and testing once deployed in the cold and dark of space.One of the biggest tasks was getting the 18 hexagonal mirror segments unfolded and aligned to within a fraction of a wavelength of light. In March, NASA released the first image (centered on a star) from the fully aligned mirror. Although it was just a calibration image, astronomers immediately compared it to existing images of that patch of sky \u2013 with considerable excitement.2. Spitzer vs MIRIThis image shows a portion of the \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019 in the infrared (see below); on the left taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and JWST on the right. The contrast in depth and resolution is dramatic. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech (left), NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI (right)This early image, taken while all the cameras were being focused, clearly demonstrates the step change in data quality that JWST brings over its predecessors.On the left is an image from the Spitzer telescope, a space-based infrared observatory with an 85 cm mirror; the right, the same field from JWST\u2019s mid-infrared MIRI camera and 6.5 m mirror. The resolution and ability to detect much fainter sources are on show here, with hundreds of galaxies visible that were lost in the noise of the Spitzer image. This is what a bigger mirror situated out in the deepest, coldest dark can do.3. The first galaxy cluster imageSMACS 0723 galaxy cluster \u2013 from Hubble on the left, and JWST on the right. Hundreds more galaxies are visible in JWST\u2019s infrared image. Credit: NASA/STSciThe galaxy cluster with the prosaic name of SMACS J0723.3\u20137327 was a good choice for the first color images released to the public from the JWST.The field is crowded with galaxies of all shapes and colors. The combined mass of this enormous galaxy cluster, over 4 billion light years away, bends space in such a way that light from distant sources in the background is stretched and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.These distorted background galaxies can be clearly seen as lines and arcs throughout this image. The field is already spectacular in Hubble images (left), but the JWST near-infrared image (right) reveals a wealth of extra detail, including hundreds of distant galaxies too faint or too red to be detected by its predecessor.4. Stephan\u2019s QuintetHubble (left) and JWST (right) images of the group of galaxies known as \u2018Stephan\u2019s Quintet\u2019. The inset shows a zoom-in on a distant background galaxy. Credit: NASA/STScIThese images depict a spectacular group of galaxies known as Stephan\u2019s Quintet, a group that has long been of interest to astronomers studying the way colliding galaxies interact with one another gravitationally.On the left we see the Hubble view, and the right the JWST mid-infrared view. The inset shows the power of the new telescope, with a zoom in on a small background galaxy. In the Hubble image we see some bright star-forming regions, but only with the JWST does the full structure of this and surrounding galaxies reveal itself.5. The Pillars of CreationThe \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019, a star-forming region of our galaxy, as captured by Hubble (left) and JWST (right). Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Anton M. Koekemoer (STScI), Alyssa Pagan (STScI).The so-called Pillars of Creation is one of the most famous images in all of astronomy, taken by Hubble in 1995. It demonstrated the extraordinary reach of a space-based telescope.It depicts a star-forming region in the Eagle Nebula, where interstellar gas and dust provide the backdrop to a stellar nursery teeming with new stars. The image on the right, taken with the JWST\u2019s near-infrared camera (NIRCam), demonstrates a further advantage of infrared astronomy: the ability to peer through the shroud of dust and see what lies within and behind.6. The \u2018Hourglass\u2019 ProtostarThe \u2018hourglass protostar\u2019, a star still in the process of accreting enough gas to begin fusing hydrogen. Inset: A much lower resolution view from Spitzer. Credit: NASA/STScI/JPL-Caltech/A. TobinThis image depicts another act of galactic creation within the Milky Way. This hourglass-shaped structure is a cloud of dust and gas surrounding a star in the act of formation \u2013 a protostar called L1527.Only visible in the infrared, an \u201caccretion disk\u201d of material falling in (the black band in the center) will eventually enable the protostar to gather enough mass to start fusing hydrogen, and a new star will be born.In the meantime, light from the still-forming star illuminates the gas above and below the disk, making the hourglass shape. Our previous view of this came from Spitzer; the amount of detail is once again an enormous leap ahead.7. Jupiter in infraredAn infrared view of Jupiter from the JWST. Note the auroral glow at the poles; this is caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun with Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.The Webb telescope\u2019s mission includes imaging the most distant galaxies from the beginning of the universe, but it can look a little closer to home as well.Although JWST cannot look at Earth or the inner Solar System planets \u2013 as it must always face away from the Sun \u2013 it can look outward at the more distant parts of our Solar System. This near-infrared image of Jupiter is a beautiful example, as we gaze deep into the structure of the gas giant\u2019s clouds and storms. The glow of auroras at both the northern and southern poles is haunting.This image was extremely difficult to achieve due to the fast motion of Jupiter across the sky relative to the stars and because of its fast rotation. The success proved the Webb telescope\u2019s ability to track difficult astronomical targets extremely well.8. The Phantom GalaxyHubble visible light (left), JWST infrared (right), and combined (middle) images of the \u2018Phantom Galaxy\u2019 M74. The ability to combine visible light information about stars with infrared images of gas and dust allow us to probe such galaxies in exquisite detail. Credit: ESA/Webb, NASA & CSA, J. Lee and the PHANGS-JWST Team; ESA/Hubble & NASA, R. Chandar Acknowledgement: J. SchmidtThese images of the so-called Phantom Galaxy or M74 reveal the power of JWST not only as the latest and greatest of astronomical instruments, but as a valuable complement to other great tools. The middle panel here combines visible light from Hubble with infrared from Webb, allowing us to see how starlight (via Hubble) and gas and dust (via JWST) together shape this remarkable galaxy.Much JWST science is designed to be combined with Hubble\u2019s optical views and other imaging to leverage this principle.9. A super-distant galaxyA \u2018zoom in\u2019 on a galaxy from one of the universe\u2019s earliest epochs, when the universe was only about 300 million years old (the small red source visible in the centre of the right panel). Galaxies at this distance are impossible to detect in visible light as their emitted radiation has been \u2018redshifted\u2019 far into the infrared. Credit: NASA/STScI/C. JacobsAlthough this galaxy \u2013 the small, red blob in the right image \u2013 is not among the most spectacularly picturesque our universe has to offer, it is just as interesting scientifically.This snapshot is from when the universe was a mere 350 million years old, making this among the very first galaxies ever to have formed. Understanding the details of how such galaxies grow and merge to create galaxies like our own Milky Way 13 billion years later is a key question, and one with many remaining mysteries, making discoveries like this highly sought after.It is also a view only the JWST can achieve. Astronomers did not know quite what to expect; an image of this galaxy taken with Hubble would appear blank, as the light of the galaxy is stretched far into the infrared by the expansion of the universe.10.

Koekemoer (STScI), Alyssa Pagan (STScI).The so-called Pillars of Creation is one of the most famous images in all of astronomy, taken by Hubble in 1995. It demonstrated the extraordinary reach of a space-based telescope.It depicts a star-forming region in the Eagle Nebula, where interstellar gas and dust provide the backdrop to a stellar nursery teeming with new stars. The image on the right, taken with the JWST\u2019s near-infrared camera (NIRCam), demonstrates a further advantage of infrared astronomy: the ability to peer through the shroud of dust and see what lies within and behind.6.

Credit: NASA/STScI/JPL-Caltech/A. TobinThis image depicts another act of galactic creation within the Milky Way. This hourglass-shaped structure is a cloud of dust and gas surrounding a star in the act of formation \u2013 a protostar called L1527.Only visible in the infrared, an \u201caccretion disk\u201d of material falling in (the black band in the center) will eventually enable the protostar to gather enough mass to start fusing hydrogen, and a new star will be born.In the meantime, light from the still-forming star illuminates the gas above and below the disk, making the hourglass shape. Our previous view of this came from Spitzer; the amount of detail is once again an enormous leap ahead.7. Jupiter in infraredAn infrared view of Jupiter from the JWST.

Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.The Webb telescope\u2019s mission includes imaging the most distant galaxies from the beginning of the universe, but it can look a little closer to home as well.Although JWST cannot look at Earth or the inner Solar System planets \u2013 as it must always face away from the Sun \u2013 it can look outward at the more distant parts of our Solar System. This near-infrared image of Jupiter is a beautiful example, as we gaze deep into the structure of the gas giant\u2019s clouds and storms. The glow of auroras at both the northern and southern poles is haunting.This image was extremely difficult to achieve due to the fast motion of Jupiter across the sky relative to the stars and because of its fast rotation.

Understanding the details of how such galaxies grow and merge to create galaxies like our own Milky Way 13 billion years later is a key question, and one with many remaining mysteries, making discoveries like this highly sought after.It is also a view only the JWST can achieve. Astronomers did not know quite what to expect; an image of this galaxy taken with Hubble would appear blank, as the light of the galaxy is stretched far into the infrared by the expansion of the universe.10.

Professional and amateur astronomers alike can spend hours scouring this image for oddities and mysteries.Over the coming years, JWST\u2019s ability to look so deep and far back into the universe will allow us to answer many questions about how we came to be.

The field is crowded with galaxies of all shapes and colors. The combined mass of this enormous galaxy cluster, over 4 billion light years away, bends space in such a way that light from distant sources in the background is stretched and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.These distorted background galaxies can be clearly seen as lines and arcs throughout this image. The field is already spectacular in Hubble images (left), but the JWST near-infrared image (right) reveals a wealth of extra detail, including hundreds of distant galaxies too faint or too red to be detected by its predecessor.4.

JacobsAlthough this galaxy \u2013 the small, red blob in the right image \u2013 is not among the most spectacularly picturesque our universe has to offer, it is just as interesting scientifically.This snapshot is from when the universe was a mere 350 million years old, making this among the very first galaxies ever to have formed. Understanding the details of how such galaxies grow and merge to create galaxies like our own Milky Way 13 billion years later is a key question, and one with many remaining mysteries, making discoveries like this highly sought after.It is also a view only the JWST can achieve.

This giant mosaic of Abell 2744An image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 created by combining many different JWST exposures. In this tiny part of the sky (a fraction of a full Moon) almost every one of the thousands of objects shown is a distant galaxy. Credit: Lukas Furtak (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) from images from the GLASS/UNCOVER teamsThis image is a mosaic (many individual images stitched together) centered on the giant Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, colloquially known as \u201cPandora\u2019s Cluster.\u201d The sheer number and variety of sources that the JWST can detect is mind-boggling; with the exception of a handful of foreground stars, every spot of light represents an entire galaxy.In a patch of dark sky no larger than a fraction of the full Moon there are umpteen thousands of galaxies, really bringing home the sheer scale of the universe we inhabit. Professional and amateur astronomers alike can spend hours scouring this image for oddities and mysteries.Over the coming years, JWST\u2019s ability to look so deep and far back into the universe will allow us to answer many questions about how we came to be.

It depicts a star-forming region in the Eagle Nebula, where interstellar gas and dust provide the backdrop to a stellar nursery teeming with new stars. The image on the right, taken with the JWST\u2019s near-infrared camera (NIRCam), demonstrates a further advantage of infrared astronomy: the ability to peer through the shroud of dust and see what lies within and behind.6. The \u2018Hourglass\u2019 ProtostarThe \u2018hourglass protostar\u2019, a star still in the process of accreting enough gas to begin fusing hydrogen. Inset: A much lower resolution view from Spitzer. Credit: NASA/STScI/JPL-Caltech/A. TobinThis image depicts another act of galactic creation within the Milky Way. This hourglass-shaped structure is a cloud of dust and gas surrounding a star in the act of formation \u2013 a protostar called L1527.Only visible in the infrared, an \u201caccretion disk\u201d of material falling in (the black band in the center) will eventually enable the protostar to gather enough mass to start fusing hydrogen, and a new star will be born.In the meantime, light from the still-forming star illuminates the gas above and below the disk, making the hourglass shape. Our previous view of this came from Spitzer; the amount of detail is once again an enormous leap ahead.7. Jupiter in infraredAn infrared view of Jupiter from the JWST. Note the auroral glow at the poles; this is caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun with Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.The Webb telescope\u2019s mission includes imaging the most distant galaxies from the beginning of the universe, but it can look a little closer to home as well.Although JWST cannot look at Earth or the inner Solar System planets \u2013 as it must always face away from the Sun \u2013 it can look outward at the more distant parts of our Solar System. This near-infrared image of Jupiter is a beautiful example, as we gaze deep into the structure of the gas giant\u2019s clouds and storms. The glow of auroras at both the northern and southern poles is haunting.This image was extremely difficult to achieve due to the fast motion of Jupiter across the sky relative to the stars and because of its fast rotation. The success proved the Webb telescope\u2019s ability to track difficult astronomical targets extremely well.8.

          "10 Times This Year the Webb Telescope Blew Astronomers Away With Stunning New Images of Our UniverseTOPICS:AstronomyAstrophysicsJames Webb Space TelescopeSwinburne University of TechnologyThe ConversationBy Colin Jacobs and Karl Glazebrook, Swinburne University of Technology\nDecember 29, 2022What looks much like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening is actually the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. Captured in infrared light by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, this image reveals previously obscured areas of star birth. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScIIt is no exaggeration to say the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) represents a new era for modern astronomy.Launched on December 25 last year and fully operational since July, the telescope offers glimpses of the universe that were inaccessible to us before. Like the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST is in space, so it can take pictures with stunning detail free from the distortions of Earth\u2019s atmosphere.However, while Hubble is in orbit around Earth at an altitude of 335 miles (540 km), the JWST is 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) distant, far beyond the Moon. From this position, away from the interference of our planet\u2019s reflected heat, it can collect light from across the universe far into the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.This ability, when combined with the JWST\u2019s larger mirror, state-of-the-art detectors, and many other technological advances, allows astronomers to look back to the universe\u2019s earliest epochs.As the universe expands, it stretches the wavelength of light traveling toward us, making more distant objects appear redder. At great enough distances, the light from a galaxy is shifted entirely out of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum to the infrared. The JWST is able to probe such sources of light right back to the earliest times, nearly 14 billion years ago.The Hubble telescope continues to be a great scientific instrument and can see at optical wavelengths where the JWST cannot. But the Webb telescope can see much further into the infrared with greater sensitivity and sharpness.Let\u2019s have a look at ten images that have demonstrated the staggering power of this new window to the universe.1. Mirror alignment completeLeft: The first publicly released alignment image from the JWST. Astronomers jumped on this image to compare it to previous images of the same part of sky like that on the right from the Dark Energy Camera on Earth. Credit: NASA/STScI/LegacySurvey/C. JacobsDespite years of testing on the ground, an observatory as complex as the JWST required extensive configuration and testing once deployed in the cold and dark of space.One of the biggest tasks was getting the 18 hexagonal mirror segments unfolded and aligned to within a fraction of a wavelength of light. In March, NASA released the first image (centered on a star) from the fully aligned mirror. Although it was just a calibration image, astronomers immediately compared it to existing images of that patch of sky \u2013 with considerable excitement.2. Spitzer vs MIRIThis image shows a portion of the \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019 in the infrared (see below); on the left taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and JWST on the right. The contrast in depth and resolution is dramatic. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech (left), NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI (right)This early image, taken while all the cameras were being focused, clearly demonstrates the step change in data quality that JWST brings over its predecessors.On the left is an image from the Spitzer telescope, a space-based infrared observatory with an 85 cm mirror; the right, the same field from JWST\u2019s mid-infrared MIRI camera and 6.5 m mirror. The resolution and ability to detect much fainter sources are on show here, with hundreds of galaxies visible that were lost in the noise of the Spitzer image. This is what a bigger mirror situated out in the deepest, coldest dark can do.3. The first galaxy cluster imageSMACS 0723 galaxy cluster \u2013 from Hubble on the left, and JWST on the right. Hundreds more galaxies are visible in JWST\u2019s infrared image. Credit: NASA/STSciThe galaxy cluster with the prosaic name of SMACS J0723.3\u20137327 was a good choice for the first color images released to the public from the JWST.The field is crowded with galaxies of all shapes and colors. The combined mass of this enormous galaxy cluster, over 4 billion light years away, bends space in such a way that light from distant sources in the background is stretched and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.These distorted background galaxies can be clearly seen as lines and arcs throughout this image. The field is already spectacular in Hubble images (left), but the JWST near-infrared image (right) reveals a wealth of extra detail, including hundreds of distant galaxies too faint or too red to be detected by its predecessor.4. Stephan\u2019s QuintetHubble (left) and JWST (right) images of the group of galaxies known as \u2018Stephan\u2019s Quintet\u2019. The inset shows a zoom-in on a distant background galaxy. Credit: NASA/STScIThese images depict a spectacular group of galaxies known as Stephan\u2019s Quintet, a group that has long been of interest to astronomers studying the way colliding galaxies interact with one another gravitationally.On the left we see the Hubble view, and the right the JWST mid-infrared view. The inset shows the power of the new telescope, with a zoom in on a small background galaxy. In the Hubble image we see some bright star-forming regions, but only with the JWST does the full structure of this and surrounding galaxies reveal itself.5. The Pillars of CreationThe \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019, a star-forming region of our galaxy, as captured by Hubble (left) and JWST (right). Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Anton M. Koekemoer (STScI), Alyssa Pagan (STScI).The so-called Pillars of Creation is one of the most famous images in all of astronomy, taken by Hubble in 1995. It demonstrated the extraordinary reach of a space-based telescope.It depicts a star-forming region in the Eagle Nebula, where interstellar gas and dust provide the backdrop to a stellar nursery teeming with new stars. The image on the right, taken with the JWST\u2019s near-infrared camera (NIRCam), demonstrates a further advantage of infrared astronomy: the ability to peer through the shroud of dust and see what lies within and behind.6. The \u2018Hourglass\u2019 ProtostarThe \u2018hourglass protostar\u2019, a star still in the process of accreting enough gas to begin fusing hydrogen. Inset: A much lower resolution view from Spitzer. Credit: NASA/STScI/JPL-Caltech/A. TobinThis image depicts another act of galactic creation within the Milky Way. This hourglass-shaped structure is a cloud of dust and gas surrounding a star in the act of formation \u2013 a protostar called L1527.Only visible in the infrared, an \u201caccretion disk\u201d of material falling in (the black band in the center) will eventually enable the protostar to gather enough mass to start fusing hydrogen, and a new star will be born.In the meantime, light from the still-forming star illuminates the gas above and below the disk, making the hourglass shape. Our previous view of this came from Spitzer; the amount of detail is once again an enormous leap ahead.7. Jupiter in infraredAn infrared view of Jupiter from the JWST. Note the auroral glow at the poles; this is caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun with Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.The Webb telescope\u2019s mission includes imaging the most distant galaxies from the beginning of the universe, but it can look a little closer to home as well.Although JWST cannot look at Earth or the inner Solar System planets \u2013 as it must always face away from the Sun \u2013 it can look outward at the more distant parts of our Solar System. This near-infrared image of Jupiter is a beautiful example, as we gaze deep into the structure of the gas giant\u2019s clouds and storms. The glow of auroras at both the northern and southern poles is haunting.This image was extremely difficult to achieve due to the fast motion of Jupiter across the sky relative to the stars and because of its fast rotation. The success proved the Webb telescope\u2019s ability to track difficult astronomical targets extremely well.8. The Phantom GalaxyHubble visible light (left), JWST infrared (right), and combined (middle) images of the \u2018Phantom Galaxy\u2019 M74. The ability to combine visible light information about stars with infrared images of gas and dust allow us to probe such galaxies in exquisite detail. Credit: ESA/Webb, NASA & CSA, J. Lee and the PHANGS-JWST Team; ESA/Hubble & NASA, R. Chandar Acknowledgement: J. SchmidtThese images of the so-called Phantom Galaxy or M74 reveal the power of JWST not only as the latest and greatest of astronomical instruments, but as a valuable complement to other great tools. The middle panel here combines visible light from Hubble with infrared from Webb, allowing us to see how starlight (via Hubble) and gas and dust (via JWST) together shape this remarkable galaxy.Much JWST science is designed to be combined with Hubble\u2019s optical views and other imaging to leverage this principle.9. A super-distant galaxyA \u2018zoom in\u2019 on a galaxy from one of the universe\u2019s earliest epochs, when the universe was only about 300 million years old (the small red source visible in the centre of the right panel). Galaxies at this distance are impossible to detect in visible light as their emitted radiation has been \u2018redshifted\u2019 far into the infrared. Credit: NASA/STScI/C. JacobsAlthough this galaxy \u2013 the small, red blob in the right image \u2013 is not among the most spectacularly picturesque our universe has to offer, it is just as interesting scientifically.This snapshot is from when the universe was a mere 350 million years old, making this among the very first galaxies ever to have formed. Understanding the details of how such galaxies grow and merge to create galaxies like our own Milky Way 13 billion years later is a key question, and one with many remaining mysteries, making discoveries like this highly sought after.It is also a view only the JWST can achieve. Astronomers did not know quite what to expect; an image of this galaxy taken with Hubble would appear blank, as the light of the galaxy is stretched far into the infrared by the expansion of the universe.10. This giant mosaic of Abell 2744An image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 created by combining many different JWST exposures. In this tiny part of the sky (a fraction of a full Moon) almost every one of the thousands of objects shown is a distant galaxy. Credit: Lukas Furtak (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) from images from the GLASS/UNCOVER teamsThis image is a mosaic (many individual images stitched together) centered on the giant Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, colloquially known as \u201cPandora\u2019s Cluster.\u201d The sheer number and variety of sources that the JWST can detect is mind-boggling; with the exception of a handful of foreground stars, every spot of light represents an entire galaxy.In a patch of dark sky no larger than a fraction of the full Moon there are umpteen thousands of galaxies, really bringing home the sheer scale of the universe we inhabit. Professional and amateur astronomers alike can spend hours scouring this image for oddities and mysteries.Over the coming years, JWST\u2019s ability to look so deep and far back into the universe will allow us to answer many questions about how we came to be. Just as exciting are the discoveries and questions we can not yet foresee. When you peel back the veil of time as only this new telescope can, these unknown unknowns are certain to be fascinating.Written by:Colin Jacobs \u2013 Postdoctoral Researcher in Astrophysics, Swinburne University of TechnologyKarl Glazebrook \u2013 ARC Laureate Fellow & Distinguished Professor, Centre for Astrophysics & Supercomputing, Swinburne University of TechnologyThis article was first published in The Conversation.
