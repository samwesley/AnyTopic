          " \n\n\nBusinessday Ng - \n\n The Nigerian tech space achieved a great milestone in 2022 and also faced some challenges. Most of these achievements remain a crucial factor necessary to boost the country\u2019s GDP, and financial inclusion, and grow a fully digital economy. The milestones experienced in the space include the 5G rollout, the startup Act, the launch of Equiano cable, the Launch of payment service banks (PSBs), and Increased Broadband Penetration. Similarly, the sector passed through many challenges in the course of the year including the massive loss of tech talents (Japa) and Global layoffs. Here is the breakdown of the milestones and challenges in the sector. Launch of Payment Service Banks (PSBs) The launch of payment service banks by MTN, Globacom, and Airtel, remains one of the major milestones the sector attains in 2022. MTN launch the MoMo PSB, Airtel Launched the SmartCash PSB and Globacom launched the MoneyMaster PSB. Following the final approval for a Payment Service Bank (PSB) licence granted by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), MTN Nigeria\u2019s fintech subsidiary, MoMo Payment Service Bank (MoMo PSB) Limited, formally commenced operations in May. Similarly, Airtel Africa secured a full Payment Service Bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through its subsidiary in April, and received an in-principle approval in 2021. Usoro Usoro, MTN momo PSB said, \u201cProviding easy-to-use, accessible, and affordable financial services to all Nigerians is essential to executing the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion strategy and the digital inclusion agenda of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.\u201d However, Globacom in October also launched its payment service bank business called the MoneyMaster PSB. The PSB had since commenced commercial operations on May 30, 2022. In a statement after the launch in Lagos, the telecom company stated that, \u201cOur over-arching business objective remains to empower Nigerians by providing them with unlimited opportunities.\u201d 5G Roll-out After 11 rounds of bidding that lasted eight hours, Mafab Communications Ltd and MTN Nigeria Plc emerged as the two successful winners of the 3.5 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum auction for the deployment of Fifth Generation (5G) technology to support the delivery of ubiquitous broadband services in Nigeria. The two winners emerged in a keenly contested 3.5GHz Spectrum auction conducted by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. MTN Nigeria kicked off an open 5G pilot ahead of commercial launch in seven cities, while Mafab is expected also to kick off soon Read also: Tech firm introduces financing options for car owners Meanwhile, the second phase of the 5G bid is ongoing with Airtel emerging as the sole bidder and winner. The emergence of Airtel as the sole bidder led NCC to cancel the entire auction process, announcing the telco as the winner of the 3.5GHz spectrum for the 5G licence. According to a statement released by the NCC, which was signed by Reuben Muoka, director, of Public Affairs, NCC, only two operators expressed interest in the auction of the 3.5Hz spectrum band. They were Airtel Networks Limited and Standard Network and only Airtel was able to make payment for the Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as of December 5, while Standard Network couldn\u2019t meet up after requesting an extended time. The 5G rollout will help in providing employment opportunities, achieve a fully digital economy, and boost financial inclusion in Nigeria. Equiano Cable On 21 April 2022, Google and cable landing partner WIOCC announced the landing of the Equiano subsea cable in Lagos, Nigeria. The cable named after Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist, Olaudah Equiano, is state-of-the-art infrastructure based on space-division multiplexing (SDM) technology, with 12 fiber pairs and a design capacity of 144Tbps, approximately 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve this region. The Equiano cable will help boost digital transformation in Nigeria. Nigeria remains the runner destination in Africa after Togo. The subsea cable offers a fifth-generation (5G) mobile service which runs from Portugal along the West Coast of Africa connecting Europe to Togo, Nigeria, Namibia, South Africa, and Saint Helena. The arrival of the subsea cable in Nigeria promises to change the internet experience of the Nigerian population and businesses in the country in many different ways, while offering millions of employment opportunities. Broadband penetration Broadband penetration in Nigeria saw a slight increase in 2022, moving up from 39.9 percent in October 2021 to 45.6 percent in October 2022 when it was last updated by the Nigerian communications commission (NCC). Industry statistics show that this growth represents a 13 percent increase in 2022. The general analysis signifies a slow growth in the 2022 broadband penetration rate which also showed that it outperformed the previous year. Industry experts maintained that the sector needs massive investment and guidelines to reach the peak. While speaking on the year\u2019s broadband performance, Umar Danbatta, executive vice chairman, NCC says the commission is active to meet its target of 70 percent broadband penetration by 2025. To meet up with the target, NCC noted that emerging technologies and advancements in the sector would enable it to match these developments with appropriate regulations and guidelines. \u201cWith the technological advancements anticipated in the coming years, it is expected that there will be a proliferation of devices in the industry. It is, therefore, essential for the Commission to ensure that the right regulatory frameworks can accommodate such eventualities, \u201dDanbatta said. Nigeria Startup Act On 19 October 2022, the Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. The NSB now known as the Nigeria Startup Act started in June 2021 and was passed by the country\u2019s National Assembly in July. This achievement was a joint initiative by Nigeria\u2019s tech startup ecosystem and the presidency with the aim to harness the potential of the country\u2019s digital economy through co-created regulations. Isa Ali Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy stated that the bill will go a long way to create and develop an enabling environment. Also, the startup act makes provision for the development and growth of technology-related talent. Pantami added that there are provisions in the act that will change the narrative of the industry. He noted that one of the provisions includes the Council for Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which will be led by the president. The task of the council is to ensure the monitoring and evaluation of the regulatory framework and to also formulate and provide general policy guidelines for the realisation of the Startup Act\u2019s objectives and give overall directions for the harmonisation of laws and regulations that affect a startup. Challenges faced by the Nigerian and Global tech space The Great Resignation (Japa wave) While the tech ecosystem has seen an increase in the number of startups and tech hubs, attracting millions of dollars in investment, not a few Nigerian tech talents are leaving the country or angling to leave the country. Many have resigned from their work for a better offer abroad leaving firms in Nigeria short of tech talents. Tech Layoffs The global tech industry has seen 119,155 employees laid off by 887 companies this year, representing the largest layoff activity in the industry, data from Layoffs.fyi have shown. The spate of tech job cuts was in reaction to the macroeconomic downturn in many major markets driven by accelerating inflation, foreign exchange volatility, and new caps on venture capital funding. Layoff activities in 2022 have so far surpassed the peak reached in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of companies to shut down and work remotely. Most firms affected by these mass layoffs include Facebook, Twitter, Stripe, Snapshot, Coinbase, and Meta among others.  \n\n\t\t\t\tTelecom industry records 218.9m active mobile subscriptions in November\t\t\t\n\n  \n\n\t\t\t\tCrypto payment firm takes Christmas to Lagos suburb\t\t\t\n\n  \n\n\t\t\t\tMobile money adoption to increase by 39% in 2025\t\t\t\n\n  \n\n\t\t\t\tHow Oluwatobi Adekunle built a digital marketing ecosystem from WhatsApp\t\t\t\n\n Get the best of world News delivered to your inbox daily \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t latest news\t\t\t\t\t\n  \n\t\t\tNigeria\u2019s oil production hits 1.35m bpd, highest in 8 months\t\t\n  \n\t\t\tBuhari, lawmakers disagree over N22.7trn CBN loans\t\t\n  \n\t\t\tObi of Onitsha denies altercation with OBJ over 2nd Niger Bridge\t\t\n  \n\t\t\tElection: NGO seeks braille ballot paper for visually impaired\t\t\n  \n\t\t\tOver 1,631 entrepreneurs benefit from Edo, BOI N2bn MSME fund\t\t\n Business Day, established in 2001, is a daily business newspaper based in Lagos.

          "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. Liftoff is set for 9:56 a.m. EST (1456 GMT).  SpaceX is ready to launch some belated New Year's fireworks of its own on Tuesday with a mission to fly 114 different satellites into orbit to kick off 2023. A Falcon 9 rocket from SpaceX will launch the company's epic Transporter-6 rideshare mission at 9:56 a.m. EST (1456 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. You can watch the launch live here at Space.com in a livestream brought to you by EOS Data Analytics (EOSDA). The Transporter-6 mission will launch EOS SAT-1 for EOSDA on this mission; that's the first of seven agriculture-focused satellites for the company's new constellation. EOS SAT-1 will be the last of the 114 satellites to deploy during the Transporter-6 mission, according to a SpaceX mission timeline. \"This launch brings new game-changing possibilities of satellite technologies to the agricultural industry. EOSDA will now work with proprietary datasets to provide even deeper and more accurate insights for its customers and partners,\" EOSDA CEO Artiom Anisimov said in a statement.  Related: 8 ways SpaceX has transformed spaceflight forever EOS SAT-1 is designed to scrutinize 386,000 miles (1 million square kilometers) daily using 11 bands of light. Examining the crop's health in this way is expected to allow farmers to better customize their care for the crops, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption and water usage, among other benefits. The full EOS SAT fleet, when ready around 2025, will aim to look at 4.6 million square miles (12 million sq. km.) every day, which is about a third more than the equivalent area of the United States. The seven satellites, built by Dragonfly Aerospace, aim to reach 100 percent of countries \"with the largest areas of farmlands and forestlands,\" EOSDA's statement added.   There are other satellite crops that will fly to space aboard Transporter-6 as well. For example, Spire Global plans to launch six satellites (opens in new tab) to expand its constellation monitoring maritime and aviation traffic using ADS-B technology.  Spaceflight Inc. plans to heft four Kleos spacecraft (opens in new tab) to a sun-synchronous orbit that keeps consistent lighting conditions below the fleet. Kleos examines radio frequency transmissions from space to search for \"hidden and illegal activity\", its website states (opens in new tab). The Transporter series of missions are \"dedicated rideshares,\" meaning that they feature what may be dozens of small satellites flying to space on a single Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX has not confirmed the full manifest of Transporter-6 on its website. The first mission of the series, Transporter-1, launched a record 143 satellites on Jan. 24, 2021. The Falcon 9 rocket for Transporter-6 has a first stage that is making its 15th flight. The booster previously launched SpaceX's Transporter-2 rideshare mission, three commercial satellite flights and 10 Starlink satellite missions, SpaceX has said. If all goes well, the booster should return to a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station for a touchdown.

          "The United States and China are locked in an age-old rivalry again, competing for stakes as high as the Moon itself. The winner could claim most of the lunar rock resources for itself. What: NASA top brass have expressed their concerns over Chinese ambitions to take over the moon one month after three Chinese astronauts returned from a six-month trip in which they helped build and open a new space station.  NASA administrator Bill Nelson seems perturbed by potential \u201cmischief China can do on the moon\u201d and believes China could attempt to corner the market on resource-rich locations on the moon's surface and try to block out the US and other countries looking to make it to the lunar object. Nelson demonstrated China\u2019s lunar ambitions citing their establishment of military bases on the hotly contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, using the bases to house weaponry and install ballistic missiles. The background: Nelson\u2019s warnings come amid NASA\u2019s failure to secure their required funding following the US Congress\u2019s passing of the budget. However, NASA\u2019s 26-day Artemis-I uncrewed mission to orbit the moon comes as a silver lining and the first big step toward NASA\u2019s plan to put people on the moon and begin building a more permanent human presence as early as 2025.  With the approval of $24.5 billion for 2023, a five percent increase over 2022, Nelson believes NASA will have enough to cover the 'essentials\u2019 - which primarily includes the Artemis-II and Artemis-III missions. China's upper hand: China has launched several robotic rovers and landers over the last few years, including an orbiter, lander, and rover that reached Mars and for the first time ever, even the far side of the moon. The US military has been on red-alert over the potential security ramifications of China\u2019s advances into deep space, and has also expressed rising concerns about the development of rival space technologies that could harm American satellites. China speaks: Though US representatives grow skeptical about the aggressive Chinese expansion spaceward, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington claims otherwise. What now: The race to the moon between the US and China is getting tighter and the next two years could determine who gains the upper hand. Copyright \u00a9 2023 India Today Group.

          "\n\n\n\n\n\n(Photo : SpaceX from Pexels ) \n  Russia blatantly violated all international laws when it invaded its border state Ukraine on February 24. As a result, the European community introduced economic scansions that ended Russia's participation in many joint programs, including space ones. Numerous projects between the Russian space agency Roscosmos and European Space Agency (ESA) have been canceled. However, there is no need to sound the alarm because ESA can find substitutes for Russian rockets and technologies. The Ukrainian space sector, particularly the private ones led by entrepreneurs like Max Polyakov, offers plenty of opportunities and technical solutions that can replace and even surpass Russian tech.  ESA ended its ExoMars mission cooperation with Roscosmos on July 13, 2022. But, even though the Russian Proton rocket will no longer carry the European-built rover to Mars, this mission is still ongoing. Replacements for the Russian launcher, navigation tech, and landing equipment are already underway.  According to Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director General, ending cooperation with Russia on this particular mission was a tough decision, but it had to be taken to ensure the ESA stays true to its principles of respecting international laws and national borders.  Besides, Proton is not the only Russian rocket that will not be launching anything for the ESA any time soon. The Soyuz launcher series used to carry lots of payloads for European customers. In particular, Soyuz ST-B was supposed to deploy two French satellites for ESA's navigation system Galileo, but this launch was canceled, too. The potential replacements ESA is considering now are Ariane 6 and Vega-C rockets. The first launcher is already in testing, and soon enough, the agency should decide whether it will be used for carrying ESA payloads.  The second option, Vega-C, can become an even greater alternative to Proton and Soyuz. The biggest advantage of Vega-C is that all European countries, including Ukraine, are manufacturing its components, which ensures a fully independent production and maintenance cycle. Plus, Ukraine has a developed scientific and manufacturing base to assist Europe in building new launchers. More importantly, the country has entrepreneurs with experience developing international-scale space projects, like Max Polyakov.  Several companies built by Maxym Polyakov already offer a wide range of quality space-related services to international clients. For example, EOS Data Analytics, founded by the Ukrainian-born entrepreneur in 2015, provides customers with high-resolution SAR and optical imagery from space. EOS Data Analytics is already planning to deploy a constellation of satellites in LEO to further enhance its services for agriculture, mining, construction, and other industry segments. Another company, founded and developed by Max Polyakov, US-based Firefly Aerospace, is building a launcher and has already been picked by NASA to develop lunar lander technology for the upcoming Artemis mission. All of this has been made possible by the entrepreneur's close collaboration with Ukrainian aerospace engineers.  ESA, too, is getting ready for Moon exploration missions of its own. The agency is planning a total of four missions: Lunar Resurs, ISRU, Orion spacecraft, and Heracles.  ESA was supposed to collaborate with Roscosmos on Lunar Resurs - a science initiative for studying soil under the Moon's surface. Roscosmos's part was to provide a lunar lander technology. To this end, the Russian space agency was planning to upgrade its old Soviet tech, Luna. To revitalize the lining equipment developed in the 1970s, Roscosmos planned to equip its upcoming Luna-25 with a new navigation system (PILOT), a lunar drill (Prospect), and a chemistry lab (ProSPA).  Ironically, the original Luna technology was developed by Ukrainian engineers, led by a Ukrainian-born Sergei Korolev. In the past fifty years, Russian engineers did not come up with any new space tech, limiting themselves to adding minor updates to 50-year-old Ukrainian developments. For Ukraine, however, the time did not stand still, and today, the Ukrainian space industry can actually offer new engineering solutions.  Today, the Ukrainian space industry is actively engaged in the development of modern spacecraft under the updated Space Program from the State Space Agency of Ukraine (SSAU).  The Ukrainian private space industry is moving forward in the same direction. New spacecraft calls for innovative component parts, and one Ukrainian startup is already developing ion engines for satellites and orbiters. These engines are as powerful as conventional models, but their low maintenance power results in smaller size and weight, thus saving satellite owners impressive amounts of money.  Innovative projects are not the only reason for ESA Ukraine cooperation. The main benefit of working with Ukraine is its talent pool. The country boasts a strong technical base, solid scientific community, and exceptionally skilled workforce. Besides, engaging experienced space entrepreneurs like Max Polyakov will give ESA further opportunities to develop cost-effective programs under the New Space Concept. Finally, the cat is already out of the bag - since ESA said its farewells to Russian providers, the search for new partners is now a necessity.  Fortunately, the first steps in ESA Ukraine cooperation have already been taken. In fact, this cooperation has been growing steadily since 2014, involving both private and government sectors. For Ukraine, ESA is not the only space partner, though. The country became the ninth to sign the Artemis Accords and is already developing tech for NASA's next moon mission.

          "Sook, Walmart, Ribble Cycles, Obsess, Jisp, B&Q, Cart.com, Compass Group, AiFi, Pets at Home, and TPP Retail were among the companies who emerged victorious at RTIH\u2019s 2022 retail technology awards. Now into their fourth year, the awards celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world. We received a record number of submissions this year across 14 categories (you can find a full rundown of the 2022 shortlists here). Our winners and highly commended companies were announced during a sold out event that took place in central London during December and was attended by retailers, tech suppliers, members of our judging panel, and sponsors. So, without further ado, here is the 2022 RTIH Innovation Awards hall of fame. Congratulations to our latest entrants! 2022 RTIH Innovation Awards winners announced. Take a bow @SookSpaces @fashinza_ @AiFiInc @BandQ @Marxent @Walmart @Secretsales @RibbleCycles @Volumental @Rotageek @obsessVR @hyperfinity @OcularTech @cartdotcom @PetsatHome @jispapp @Red_Ant @Retail247_ https://t.co/L58js3Wx0C Chatermill research, based on customer reviews, revealed delivery to be one of the biggest issues for retail customers, with speed and timeliness being key contributors to the negative sentiment received by some of the most popular fashion retail brands. Chattermill analysed feedback from over 152,000 public Trustpilot reviews, registered from 1st January to 4th September, from customers buying at Asos, H&M, New Look, Next and Zara.  Based on ratings given by customers, New Look and Asos had the best customer experience, while Zara had the worst. Delivery complaints frequently centre on the fact that despite stating on their websites a limited number of days for delivering purchases \u2014 usually around two to four days \u2014 packages tend to be delayed, with items frequently arriving out of the suggested timeframe. An explanation for this could be linked to the courier service used by the fashion brands analysed.  Based on the feedback collected from customers, Evri (formerly Hermes) is the most problematic courier brand, followed by DHL and Yodel in number of negative reviews.  Registrations for Retail Technology Show 2023 are now open. The show will take place at London\u2019s Olympia on 26th-27th April. New for 2023, a newly expanded show floor will see the Retail Technology Show showcase even more cutting-edge tech.  It will add an additional 2,000m2 of exhibition space by expanding into Olympia\u2019s National Hall in addition to the Grand Hall that hosted last year\u2019s show. 300+ innovators \u2013 from tech\u2019s biggest players, fast growth disruptors and startups - will showcase their solutions.

The latest Trigo powered REWE store went live in central Munich.  The REWE Pick&Go location is in the Maxvorstadt neighbourhood, which is also known as the cultural heart of Munich.  This high traffic area is only a few minutes\u2019 walk from the city\u2019s central train station, museums, and galleries, and some of Germany\u2019s top universities, making it a good location for both REWE and Germany\u2019s first ever 100% autonomous store. In an online post, Michael Gabay, CEO at Trigo, said: \u201cThis store is a product of the close and long standing partnership between REWE and Trigo, who, together, created effective and efficient processes over time that serve as a model for additional store expansion.\u201d He added: \u201cOpening the first fully autonomous store in Germany makes a bold statement in the retail industry.

          "OnePlus Nord 2 review Return of the flagship-killer September sky events  Meteor showers, a comet, asteroids and more Mehul Reuben DasJan 02, 2023 18:36:26 IST The Peking University in China has unveiled its plan to build the largest optical telescope in Asia and close the gap in astronomy capabilities with the rest of the world. This move comes amidst China\u2019s expanding space programme after being shut out of global space collaborations at the behest of NASA and being left in isolation for years. Representational Image. Image Credit: Space.com The project aims to create the first stage of the telescope, which will have an aperture of 6 metres wide, by 2024. Later on, in another 6 years, a different module will be attached to it, which will have an aperture of 8 metres. The project is called the Expanding Aperture Segmented Telescope or EAST in English. According to a statement released by Peking University, the telescope \u201cwill greatly improve China\u2019s observation capabilities in optical astronomy.\u201d The EAST abbreviation is fitting since the facility would become the first world-class optical telescope in the eastern hemisphere. The world\u2019s largest facilities as of today are in the Western Hemisphere at sites around Mauna Kea in Hawaii, Atacama in Chile, and the Canary Islands off the coast of northwest Africa, and is controlled by a coalition of nations led by the US. The EAST telescope\u2019s first phase envisions building a mirror made up of 18 hexagonal mirror segments, resembling the mirror for NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope. The mirror would have a diameter of around 6 metres feet, again similar to that of JWST. A digital render of the completed Expanding Aperture Segmented Telescope or EAST. Image credit: Peking University However, unlike the JWST which orbits about 1.5 million kilometres away from the Earth, the  EAST telescope would be built on Saishiteng Mountain near Lenghu Town in Qinghai Province on the Tibetan plateau at an altitude of around 4200-4500 metres. The second phase would add a ring of 18 more hexagonal segments around the mirror, expanding it to a diameter greater than 8 metres. Peking University estimates the project will cost between 500-600 million yuan or $69-84 million. The university also notes that astronomy plays an important part in technology and social development, and that the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to scientists who discovered the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way using powerful optical telescopes including the twin Keck telescopes atop Mauna Kea and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. EAST would also be a rather important addition to China\u2019s broader growing astronomy capabilities. The country has built the world\u2019s largest single-aperture radio telescope called FAST, and plans to launch a large space observatory known as Xuntian as soon as late 2023. China also launched its own space station called the Tiangong space station last month, after completing the building and docking of its final module in late 2022.

Sarah has worked for NASA for more than 18 years and has experience applying advanced materials to space structures. Jeff talks to Sarah about her education, how she came to NASA and how she helped guide composites use there.  Sarah Cox, NASA Photo Credit: Sarah Cox Jeff Sloan (JS): Hi, Sarah, and welcome to CW talks.\n  Sarah Cox (SC): Hi, Jeff. Thanks, I'm happy to be here. JS: It's great to have you here. We're going to talk about your current job and your current work in a second. But before I just want to start with your education, tell us a little bit about where and how you were first exposed to composite materials. SC: So I actually didn't really get involved in composites until about eight or nine years into my career. So I kind of have a kind of look at it as like, you know, the second part of my career. Initially I got my bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech and I was fortunate enough to get hired right out of college to work on the shuttle program at Kennedy Space Center. I actually worked in the thermal protection system, which is all of the like tiles and blankets that cover the Orbiter. And it kind of turned out to be a good introduction for me into nonmetallic materials and processing and bonding and that kind of thing. I worked on the space shuttle orbiter from 2004, until the program ended in 2011. We knew the shuttle would be retiring and everyone went through a bit of a transition period. So for me, it was kind of, you know, okay, I've been doing this for seven years or so kind of, what do I want to do now. So, you know, I had a few different options and opportunities to look into. But I ended up getting pulled into some composites project, able to do some hands on work. And I realized that pretty quickly that I really loved doing that. So at that time, there were a couple of NASA projects going on, that Kennedy was a part of, those were agency level projects. So we were working with other composites engineers from Langley, and Goddard, and Marshall and Glenn. So one of those was composites for exploration, which was looking at the advancement of large out of autoclave structures. And the other one was the composite cryo Tank Project, which we actually worked with, with Boeing to develop and fabricate a full scale composite cryo tank. And these projects were really great, because of the work that we were able to do at Kennedy, I got some good hands on experience making test panels, learning how to lay up composite panels, doing vacuum bagging, and all the fun challenges that come with that and getting a good vacuum. We also did some composite repair work. With all the NASA centers, each one kind of has their areas of specialty. So some are more into the research side, some are more into design, some are more into manufacturing. Kennedy has always really been seen as the place where, you know, for launch and landing, so, all of the flight hardware that's going to launch comes here gets gets integrated, gets processed for all the final processing in order to launch and, and even with the work I did during the shuttle program, a lot of it was making sure that the hardware was good for launch. And so, focusing some of our composite work on damaged composites and repair processes. That was a really good fit for us to focus on that Kennedy. So around this time that I was I was really getting this experience in composites. I had also decided that I wanted to get my master's degree. And with the previous work I had done I really found that I liked materials engineering. So it was a really good combination of being able to do my master's focusing on composite materials and the work that I was doing at Kennedy. And then kind of following that, I was actually able to work on a payload called advanced plant habitat, which is actually up at the space station, it has been there for about five years or so. And they're using it to grow different types of plants. This project was actually led out of Kennedy amd it was decided that we were going to build part of this out of composite. So I was part of that kind of design and development team. We actually did the fabrication work at Kennedy. So it was really exciting to be able to build something that is actually in space.  JS: That\u2019s really great. So before we leave the space shuttle, how did you feel about the space shuttle program being canceled? Do you have a soft spot in your heart for it? Or was it you know, just a job that you did, and you're ready to move on? What was it like for you? SC: Oh, it's very much a soft spot, I loved working shuttle and getting to work around the orbiters every day, getting them ready for launch, getting to watch them launch, getting to watch them land, and then work on them again, that was a really fun program to work on. So it was sad to see it end. For us it was both, you know, having to retire the hardware but then also, a lot of the people that we worked with, everyone had to transition to different things. So, it was a pretty emotional time. But, when you look at the big picture of human spaceflight, and the space program, and budgets and how you're spending your money, I think that's it. At some point, things had to transition to move on to the next thing. So, you know, maybe a little bit bittersweet that I'm so fortunate that I got to work on that program. But it's also been a lot of fun kind of seeing the changes and kind of what's coming next. JS: So, what drew you to NASA in the first place? Or were you drawn, when you came out of Georgia Tech, what attracted you to NASA? SC: You know, I had decided in high school that I really liked rockets, I thought rockets were cool. That was kind of my decision of, like, if I want to do this, I want to go work for NASA. So getting my undergrad in aerospace engineering just kind of seemed the natural thing to do for me. And, you know, I had always thought Kennedy Space Center is really the place to be, this is where they're launching rockets from, and at the time the shuttle program was landing the orbiters here, so it kind of felt felt like the right thing. And again, I was so fortunate to be able to get hired down here and work on that program. JS: I want to talk a little bit about your current role. Can you just describe for us the job that you're doing right now and how you evolved into that role? SC: Yeah, so at Kennedy, I am basically the composite subject matter expert here, I mostly support the Commercial Crew Program, but I also support the Launch Services Program, which handles all the uncrewed launches, you know, launching satellites, and rovers and that kind of thing. But, you know, I have a really great group of composites engineers that I work with here at Kennedy, and really just across the agency. All of the centers all the programs, all those programs have some composites on them. So we really have a good community across the agency, sharing knowledge. In addition to, the work that I do here, it's also about kind of having those connections across the agency and being able to have access to the right folks to help you with your job. I think that up to this point, this community has been relatively small but it's growing pretty quickly, both here at Kennedy and across the agency. JS: Can you tell us a little bit about the programs that you're working on that you're most involved with right now? SC: Yeah, so I mainly support the Commercial Crew Program and we are working with SpaceX and Boeing on certifying their spacecraft and launch vehicles in order for them to take astronauts to the space station. So, you know, again, with shuttle, that was one of shuttles main jobs once once Space Station got built, was taking astronauts up there. So when that ended this was, commercial crew was the follow on to that to, to transfer that function to these companies to be able to continue to take astronauts. So, my role is to review and assess all of their composite structures, making sure that that they're meeting their requirements and that their, their vehicles are, you know, are certified to fly. And so it's kind of come a little full circle for me, you know, having started in the shuttle program. I do love working human spaceflight. But then having that time to get the the hands on experience and get some expertise in composites. This is a really good fit. JF: So before we leave this idea of, well, before we leave the space shuttle again, I wanted to point out, I don't know how many people know this, but, you know, once the Space Shuttle Program was discontinued, the US lost the ability to send and retrieve astronauts to the space station. So we relied for many years on the Russians, correct? To help us transport to and from the space station. So just tell us a little bit about that. SC: Yeah, you know, the Russians were basically, they're the only way that we could get people to and from the station. Once shuttle ended in 2011, until late 2020, when we really launched the first crew rotation back from US soil. All that time, we were really relying on them in order to take astronauts back and forth. JS: How did that feel to you having worked on the space shuttle and feeling like being a part of a team that was, you know, helping keep that vehicle operating, and then having it go away? And then not having that capability for so long? I mean, that's, that's almost 10 years. SC: Yeah, it's a long time to, to not have that capability. But development of these new vehicles to be able to do that, that takes time. And I think that, on the one hand, it, it is a long time. But on the other hand, all of the work that has been going into the commercial crew program to be able to do this again. It's been a lot of work. So yes, 10 years is a long time. But you know, on the other hand, it's kind of a blink of an eye, just with all the work that we've had to do to get here. JS: Right, so nobody's been sitting around not doing nothing.  SC: Oh, definitely not. JS: Yeah. So let's talk about the certification process. Can you just walk me through what that looks like? You know, what is your role? And what is the role of the manufacturer? You mentioned Boeing and SpaceX? Obviously, you must work with them and communicate with them. Tell us a little bit about what that looks like. SC: Yeah, so, like you said, SpaceX and Boeing are the two partners in the Commercial Crew Program. We have to certify their spacecraft on their launch vehicles. And, you know, for SpaceX, that means we're looking at the Crew Dragon and the Falcon nine launch vehicle. On the Boeing side, they're building the CST 100. And then they've actually contracted out to ULA, to use the Atlas five launch vehicle. So there's really kind of three different companies we have to work with on this. My role is really to do the review and the assessment of all of those composite structures. And so kind of where this starts is that we have our NASA standards, and these provide the requirements that have to be met for the program, part of the original contract. So there's three main ones that I have to deal with that have requirements relevant to composite structures. One of those is the materials and processes standard, which has requirements for every kind of material that that you could use and addresses everything from allowables to materials compatibility to requirements for special processes like composites fabrication and bonding and welding. The second one that I have to look at is the structural requirements. Specifically, I'm kind of looking more at what is being done for the qualification of the structural components, what safety factors they're being used, that kind of thing. Then the third one is the fracture control requirements, which fracture control deals with how you are assessing defects and damage, how you're handling damage tolerance, looking at flaws and flaw growth. Again, you know, the these documents, cover materials across the board metallics and metallics. Because of the nature of composites, to kind of pull those pieces of the requirements from each of those documents in order to, you know, kind of have that integrated approach for what we need to do for composite structures. So, when you're looking at design values, and allowables, that you're going to use in your analysis but with composites, you can't just take an allowables value from some published handbook, that doesn't really exist for composites. I mean, there has been a lot of development and in trying to kind of standardize that process and having that information, but you really have to understand your ply layup, your fabrication process bagging, you know, what your cure cycle is, you have to understand the design features and how that's affecting the loading going through the part. Then, back to that fracture aspect, you have to understand and account for defects that you could have in your part, you know, potential impact damages, and we don't really have established analysis methods to look at flaws and flaw growth in composites. So a lot of that has to be done through empirical testing to understand how that's affecting your strength. Also, you know, unlike with metals, you can have an internal defect or delamination that happens from an impact, with nothing visible on the surface. So, kind of understanding that damage characterization and trying to protect against it, and also understanding how that affects your structure. So, really what this comes down to is, it requires a lot of testing, you know, you kind of start at that coupon level to get your kind of your basic design values, but then you're also going up to kind of that next level with kind of making sure you're accounting for the different features, and for any defects that you kind of need to account for within your part. So that's basically how we have to use those requirements and kind of how we're really having to implement them, for now, is through a lot of testing.  JS: Are you doing the testing yourself? Or are you depending on your partners, Boeing, and SpaceX and ULA to provide that data for you? SC: Yeah, so, the way Commercial Crew was set up, this is a different approach from how NASA kind of typically sets up their contracts, especially comparing back to something like shuttle. So these partners, they are the ones that own the hardware. And so all of all the documentation and all of their designs belong to them. So, they're the ones that are having to do all of that work, and we're just working with them on on ensuring requirements are met. So with Commercial Crew, the first phase was to work with them to ensure that their documentation and their requirements, were meeting our NASA standards. And then when we got to kind of more of the demonstration phase where they're actually designing and building flight hardware. It's their responsibility to provide all the evidence for how they're meeting these requirements. So for me as the customer, it's my responsibility to understand what they're doing, how they're doing this testing, to review all that data, you know, make sure that they're, they're accounting for all of these things, all the configurations, all the conditions that that these parts are going to go through, and be sure that that's all a part of their test program. Then also, looking at those results, making sure we understand those results and working with the structures team, to make sure that those are being implemented into the analysis, that we understand how that's being done. But then, even in addition to just all the testing required, we're making sure we understand that the fabrication processes that they're using and that documentation, how they're inspecting their hardware, you know, what protections and mitigations they have in place to try to prevent any sort of damage that could happen during assembly operations or transportation. So we are working very closely with all the partners to, to make sure that all of these requirements are being met and, and that we understand how this is working. There's always going to be special circumstances, where things may not line up the way I originally planned. And so work with them on that too, just to make sure that we have an approach that everyone agrees to. JS: Quick question, are the requirements for Commercial Crew the same as the requirements, say, on the launch vehicle? Or are you working with because they're performing different functions, are you working with different requirements, or they just sustain across the board? SC: The requirements are the same, how you're meeting, those requirements may be different, just because of the different environments that you're in, whether it's the temperatures that you're seeing the types of loads that you're seeing. So it is really making sure that the implementation of those requirements is being met for all the hardware. So that's kind of all the initial stuff that has been happening and getting through kind of what we call the demonstration phase, where each partner had to do one uncrewed, and one crewed test mission in order to be considered, you know, certified and start that regular rotation of taking crew to the station. But even at that point, we continue to have insight into the flight hardware, what's going on with the flight builds any issues that come up any changes that need to happen? So, we're continuing to work with him on that. And, you know, the the current status of the program, Boeing, Boeing did have an uncrewed launch, they had an anomaly and so the decision was made to do another uncrewed test flight. So they're still kind of working towards that. SpaceX actually did make it through certification. They had both their uncrewed and their crewed test flights. And they've taken to two rotations of crew to station so far. Right now, what they call the crew to mission is up on space station. And then kind of the late October, early November timeframe crew three astronauts are going to launch and the crew two astronauts will come home, you know, so the two partners are in kind of different places at the moment. But it is a really busy time, you know, following multiple vehicles for each of these partners. But but we have a really great team, both here at Kennedy and also working with engineers at Johnson on this. JS: What is the schedule for Boeing's next uncrewed launch? Do you know? SC: I do not know at this time, I know that they're working towards something. JS: Either for the uncrewed and crewed launches, do you require SpaceX and Boeing to provide information about the performance of the craft during those flights? What what kind of information do you do you need or want from them to make sure that craft are performing the way they're supposed to? SC: Yeah, the team's work very closely together, through the entire cycle of launch and on orbit and landing to make sure that the that the vehicle is performing as expected. So there's continuous activity going on during that time for for composite structures, that it's typically pretty pretty quiet. When the vehicles on orbit there's not really a lot going on with that. But uh, but definitely during landing and splashdown and all the inspections that happen when the vehicle comes back, we're working with them to get that information and understand and make sure that there was any off nominal things that were found that that we're making sure that the next vehicle is is going to be safe to fly. JS: I can imagine given the variability of composites materials and processes combined with the variability of the structures that you're working with it each project you work on must be unique and wondering if that's true and and what are the challenges associated with this? SC: Yeah, I think one of the main challenges is just all the options in the composite material systems for all the possible combinations of different resin systems, different carbon fiber systems types of weave, so even just at the basic raw material level, each of these variables can change the properties of your material and of your final component. So it's even beyond, you have having different layups in different fabrication processes but if there's any changes within the material system itself, that that can cause you to go do more more testing to ensure that you understand how that change has affected your material and your material properties. And working with these different companies, means having to know about different material systems. So, you know, as we've been going through this initial development and certification phase, we have to kind of do a little bit of our own research into these material systems, you know, understanding what information is out there, and getting additional information from the partners for that. And then each of these partners has to do their own testing. And so then have to review all of that data. Being on the application side of things with aerospace, and something that is so critical, it is really important to understand your material and to have all those controls in place so that you're getting a consistent product every time. And of course, we want to see development of new technologies and composites of resins that can handle higher temperatures or material systems that are more damage tolerant, we need to be making progress in those areas. But as someone who is certifying or working towards the certification of things that are actually watching you, you want something that's kind of established at that time, just to make sure that you understand your your materials and your final product. JS: Does that mean that your partners are only using qualified materials? Or is it possible for them to introduce an unqualified material into a program like this? SC: Any material that they are going to use, we have to, there has to be qualification of that data out there. So they can bring something that maybe we haven't, that, you know, whether I personally may have not been familiar with in the past, but it's doing that research and understanding what that material is, and understanding the vendor process and how, and how the partner is using that material and looking at getting help from other experts across the agency to see if somebody else has some experience with that material. So holding on all the resources, you know, we want to work with a partner who's you know, the goal here is to succeed and if they think they have something that needs to be changed, or they want to try, they're trying something different, we of course, want to work with them to make sure that everyone understands, what that is and that we're all on the same page. And that it's, there's not any additional risk by using that material. JS: Yeah. I'm sure you work with engineers at SpaceX and Boeing who were very familiar and comfortable with composites. But I wonder if there are any common problems or challenges associated with composite launch vehicle and spacecraft development? What have you learned in working with these various companies and people at different levels? SC: Yes. In addition to the things we've already discussed, as far as different material systems and different configurations that they're being used for, the different companies do have different approaches to how they want to meet the requirements. There's not a set proscribed way to exactly what you have to do to meet the requirements. And so, so being on the NASA side, it's kind of an interesting position, because I get to see these different approaches that these different companies use. Sometimes it can bring some challenges if it's something that we aren't familiar with, but it also brings a lot of interesting conversation and to looking at different ways that requirements can be met different approaches that can be done, you know, that are still going to provide a good result in the end. So it always makes for interesting conversation, and it's really, it's good to be able to see those different approaches and different ways things can be done. In addition to the NASA composites community that we have, I'm also involved with composite materials handbook, which, you know, we call CMH, 17. This handbook, it really started as providing guidance more on the, you know, for for FAA, and on the aircraft side, there are differences in kind of the life, the life of a spacecraft versus an airplane and the environments that they see, but there's a lot of similarity to as far as the the development of, of allowables and damage tolerance testing that needs to be done. Actually, through this community, we do have a have a group, from the aerospace industry side of things that, that is working to put together some guidance kind of geared towards the space applications. This group includes those of us from the government side, as well as private companies. So, it's a really good mix of, of people and ideas, as far as looking at different ways to, to approach how to have safe human spaceflight. JS: You said guidance, what kind of guidance do you mean? SC: Guidance, as far as types of testing that should be performed? How much testing should be performed, considerations, as far as having different lots of material and understanding your your fabrication process, looking at, what do you have to consider as far as defects and damage and what testing should be done for that and what they call the building block approach where the coupon level, you're doing a lot of coupons to get your basic allowables values, but then as you kind of go up that building block, when you're looking at kind of sub element level, and you're using that to kind of correlate more to your analysis, and then, up to a full scale, where you're only going to do maybe one full scale article, testing at that level. So, a lot of that kind of information as far as just what the testing needed and kind of how do you incorporate those results into the design? Because designing for composite structures, I think is very different than designing for metals, we really have to consider, you really have to consider, your your manufacturing processes. You know, upfront as far as how you're going to design that part. I think there's been a big push for also designing for damage tolerance, making sure that your your hardware has damage tolerance, or that you have good ways of inspecting it. So it's really that that handbook has been been around for decades, and it's continued to get updated with more of the latest information and trying to to provide, you know, the best information that we have, based on new data, new technologies. JS: Are you talking about enhancing the protocols and standards already in the handbook? Or are you talking about developing more space craft specific standards separate from the handbook. SC: So, the handbook itself is really more of a guidance for how to meet requirements, because even just looking at the space side, NASA has different requirements than the DOD for their launch vehicles and their space hardware. And this is part of what is good with with this group is kind of the exchange of ideas on why we have certain requirements and why they may have other requirements and in the end, it's all really meeting the same intent. So the idea of putting guidance into the handbook is to allow someone who maybe isn't as familiar with building composite structures for aerospace capabilities to kind of help them navigate maybe what some of those standards and requirements are trying to say. The requirements have to be fairly general, because there's a lot of different types of structures and types of environments. And so they have to stay general. But then when you really start to look into specific applications and providing some examples of here's how this structure could be designed to meet these requirements. JS: Okay. Where do you see the most activity in composites, materials and processing right now? You mentioned that your partners come to you with maybe creative and slightly different ideas about how to meet certain requirements and certifications. But I can imagine, also, they must come to you with some ideas about how to apply some new technologies as well. So can you talk a little bit about what you see on the horizon? And what's being explored for spacecraft? SC: Yeah, from what I see from these launch vehicles and spacecraft, there is a push for large out of autoclave structures, and aerospace companies have typically been using autoclave materials, because you're typically going to get a higher quality, more controlled, lower porosity, from having that autoclave process. But as they look at building larger single structures, we're kind of outgrowing autoclaves and having an autoclave and building a bigger autoclave is a huge expense. So we are seeing a push towards that development of out of autoclave materials, that will still produce that high quality part that we need. Another reason to build these larger structures, as you know, a single piece is to eliminate the need for joints and having to put a bunch of fasteners through your composite part, that kind of defeats a little bit of the purpose of having a lightweight composite part if you're then having to go putting metal through it for all these joints. I think there is a lot of benefit to having these bigger structures and eliminating that complexity of having joints. Speaking of joints, there's that area of bonding, bonded joints, bonded structures, there's still work to be done there. Bonding is a tricky thing. Making sure that you don't have any contaminants, that you have good surface prep, that you have a robust bonding process and that you're getting consistent results every time. That is still I think, doing that and having a way to verify that with every build that you do. I think there's still some challenges there that that the industry is working through. JS: You mentioned earlier, the challenge of damage from impact and the fact that it's not often visible. I wonder if there's any concern about sending a craft up a crewed vehicle say the possibility that it sustains damage that goes unnoticed or unrecognized, and then introduces a potential flaw into the structure that could be life threatening to the crew when the crew returns? I'm sure this is a kind of thing you think about every day, but I'm wondering what you think about that, and how that factors into some of the work you do? SC: Yeah, designing for damage tolerance is a huge part of what we do. I will say, launching rockets and human spaceflight is a very challenging thing and you're never going to eliminate all the risks. But we work really hard to to reduce that risk as much as we can. So in the initial design phase, that's really where this kind of stuff needs to be included and thinking through where are we most sensitive or most critical to impacts and how are we ensuring that we have a good design for that and trying to think about all those scenarios of what could happen and how are we protecting the structure or are mitigating some process to try to prevent that from happening. So that is definitely a big part of the entire process of making sure that we're not going to have a damage that could result in some, reduced capability beyond what we're able to handle.  JS: Is that challenge often met via redundancy or via just a robust design? I mean, I'm sure the designs are robust anyhow. But is there a strategy there for meeting that? That damage challenge? SC: Yeah, and I think, unfortunately, at that moment, that's why there's so much testing that needs to be done up front. So you're not only doing your testing to understand your compression and tension, strength of your material and your layups, but you're also having to do testing where you are embedding defects to understand how does that affect the capability, it's often we do you what you call compression after impact testing, where you're taking tests, coupons, doing different levels of impacts, and then doing mechanical testing to understand how that reduces your capability. That is actually a big driver for the design values that we use, because we're basically designing in that damage tolerance to say, you could have an impact that didn't get detected and at a certain level, but the structure is going to be able to handle that, because we've designed the part to be able to handle that. JS: Okay. Right. So final question about damage. And then I want to talk about the future. I can also imagine a crewed spacecraft goes up to the space station and the damage is detected and perhaps that damage is significant enough that it affects the ability of the craft to return to Earth. You mentioned repair earlier, are there procedures or processes and materials in place that would allow say, an astronaut to perform a repair on a on a crewed spacecraft at the space station? I can imagine that would be very difficult. SC: So currently, no, not that I'm aware of. It has to do more with the contingency planning from keeping the crew there and being able to get a spacecraft there that is safe. So yeah, station is a great place. Not only are people living there and doing a lot of research there, but then yeah, it's allowing for that opportunity to if something does happen, having that time to be able to react to that and, and have contingency plans in place for that. JS: Yeah. Alright, so let's talk about the future. I know that NASA's partners, Boeing and SpaceX have big plans to send spacecraft and people back to the moon eventually, Mars, I know, you know, Elon Musk has talked a lot about going to Mars. This must have introduced a host of mechanical and thermal and ballistic and other challenges that must be met by composite materials. I'm wondering if your job requires do you think about these things and what kind of evolution in composites M&P is going to be required to meet these challenges, do you think? SC: Yeah, I'm very much involved in what's happening right now with these launches but Commercial Crew Program is really a small part of the bigger picture of NASA, even just looking at the human exploration side of things, you know, there's a lot of work going on with with getting back to the moon and getting to Mars. The Artemis program is in development, and they're trying to get those launches happening here in the next few years. Even just beyond that, and you can even see with Artemis, much more of that vehicle uses composites than Apollo or even shuttle. We even see from the commercial companies, the ones that I work with and even Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada, they're starting to use more composites in a more strategic way. So, even what we're seeing, from I'll say, more of a short term with these, this kind of new generation of launch vehicles and spacecraft, there is a lot of room for for development there and making those lighter, more efficient launch vehicles. But, you know, it's not only about, how do we get to space, but also, how do we live there, and I think composites are a very important part of that. We're going to have to, there's a lot of work and learning how to use resources from these other planetary bodies to actually build things to build structures. We are going to have to develop ways to do repairs in space, you're not always going to have the option of coming home. Not as a quick option. We need to be able to have these ways that people are really able to live in, in space and, and have the resources that they need. And so I see composites technology playing a big role in that for the future. I know a lot of work is going on, both around and within NASA and with all the partners that they're working with, to do that. You mentioned things like thermal and ballistic and that kind of thing. I'm not really involved in this, but I know that there's a lot of work going on to get higher temperature capabilities, development of hot structures. So, right now, with a lot of our spacecraft and any of the launch vehicles, you have to attach a separate thermal protection system to your structure to keep the structure below a certain temperature, but with the development of those higher temperature capabilities, you can reduce weight even more by not having the separate system for that. So there's a lot of different areas where I think composites are are going to be a big benefit. JS: Well, I'm wondering, we were talking earlier about launching and landing and the you know, the material performance in different stages of a spacecraft\u2019s performance. I think my observation has always been that launching a spacecraft is really, really difficult because of gravity. Which sounds kind of elementary, but overcoming gravity and getting a mass off the earth and into even into orbit, takes a lot of energy and effort. I'm wondering, when you think about sort of the life of a spacecraft when it travels up and comes back? Where's the greatest opportunity for, for damage? Or where does that spacecraft see the most mechanical stress when it's going up, say to the space station and coming back down. SC: So, as far as the performance of the structure, the mechanical stress, launch, launch and landing, obviously launch vehicles their big thing is the launch, but even now, we're seeing with what SpaceX is doing with the reuse of their Falcon nine, first stage, they're also having to design for that reentry and landing. So, those are definitely for spacecraft launch and landing. And now we're seeing even for some parts of the launch vehicle, they have to design for launch and landing. The on orbit portion, from a structures perspective is usually pretty low concern. It doesn't really see a lot of loading. When you talk about damage, you know, again, my perspective is coming from working here at Kennedy and doing a lot of ground processing. And I think the aircraft side of things will tell you this too, that really being on the ground and having people work on the vehicle is where you\u2019re most sensitive to getting damage. We put protections in place, we have mitigations, everybody understands the sensitivity of composites hardware, but human nature and having people work around these vehicles, things are gonna happen. So it's about having the rates the right processes in place to try to prevent what you can and having a good reporting mechanism in place so when things do happen, that everything is getting assessed correctly. JS: So if if somebody drops a wrench on to composite structure, you don't want them to not report it, you want them to feel comfortable coming forward and saying this is what happened, this is what I did. And, gosh, I'm really sorry, but you need to know that this happened. And there that has to there have to be processes in place to make that OK and to facilitate that. Because I think human nature, like you said, human nature tends to want to, to not fess up when we make a mistake. SC: Right. And so it's about developing that culture of we, our number one job is to protect the astronauts. So making sure that the launch vehicle and the spacecraft are going to perform their job safely. And making sure that everybody working on those parts understands that. Especially with composites, people who haven't worked around composites may, you know, drop something and think, oh, I don't see anything. So it's about making sure that everyone has that training, they understand the sensitivity of composites. And so that they know that they need to report that to be sure that that gets assessed. JS: Okay, final question. This is an easy one. If you were given the chance of spaceflight, how far would you go? So, you could go either, so let's say low earth orbit, so the space station. Would you go to the moon? Or would you go to Mars, or maybe further than Mars? SC: So, you know, I have a degree in aerospace engineering. So people do ask me, do you want to be an astronaut? My immediate answer is always no. I love being around rockets, I love watching launches and I am really excited that other people want to go to space. But I don't, I guess have that same sense of adventure as far as as going to space. But, you know, these are really interesting times right now. Up until this point, it's really been government agencies sending astronauts and cosmonauts to space. And now we're seeing this shift to what's been going on with Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic and SpaceX with, you know, taking private citizens to the edge of space and to orbit the Earth. I think this is an exciting time to see all that happening and you know, opening the door for, we'll say, us normal people to be able to do that type of thing. So I hope that that opportunity continues to grow. JS: Well, I think you're right, I think this is an exciting time and I think it's gonna be really interesting what the next, I don't know, couple decades, 50 years bring. But I obviously the work that you're doing is critical to protecting our astronauts and protecting the the folks we're sending up to the space station and probably beyond. So I thank you for that work. It sounds very interesting and I appreciate you coming on and talking to me about the work that you're doing. SC: Thank you so much for this opportunity.

          "Hit enter to search or ESC to close  \n Golden Period For Space Technology: Many good things are about to start in the new year.  This year is considered important in many ways.  This year is also considered very important for space technology.  This year, 5 space missions of the world on which everyone\u2019s eyes will be fixed.  In these 4 missions, India\u2019s private space company Sky Route is going to be launched with the first 3D printed rocket.  Important space missions to be launched this year also include Japan\u2019s mission Dearmoon and NASA\u2019s asteroid mission.  Let us tell you which missions will be launched this year. 1. SpaceX\u2019s Super Heavy Starship In this year, the weight of the cargo of SpaceX\u2019s super heavy starship is about 1 lakh kg.  This cargo will be included in the lower orbit of the earth.  It will have two components.  The first component will be the spacecraft and the second component will be the super heavy rocket.  This cargo is made of 39 powerful engines, which will lift it to a height of 65 kilometers.2. Japan\u2019s \u2018Dearmoon\u2019 mission In this mission of Japan, a team of 8 people will go round the moon and land on its surface.  The success of this mission will also reveal the future of deep space tourism.  3. Jupiter Icy Moons ExplorerScientists believe that many types of precious metals including gold and platinum are present in Utah.  Scientists also believe that water is also present at this place.  This mission will come to America on 24 September.  In this mission, NASA\u2019s Osiris also has to return from near the Earth with a sample of Bennu Asteroid.  4. Sky Route\u2019s 3D Printed Rocket\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b  India\u2019s first private space company Sky Route will launch another satellite this year.  Its goal is to speed up the production of 3D-printed rockets.  This will reduce the cost of private launch.  Two private companies will also launch rockets this year.

          "\n          By JULIAN SHEA in London | \n          China Daily Global |\n          Updated: 2023-01-03 09:40\n         Europe is becoming increasingly less attractive for the physical headquarters of big tech companies after years of expansion and growth, with major offices in London and Dublin being mothballed for a variety of economic and business reasons. The Financial Times reports that organizations including Google and Facebook's parent companies Alphabet and Meta are leading the way in abandoning their leased premises in the two cities. Rising interest rates and an increased desire for home working having made office space less of a requirement and more of a financial burden, and in many cases companies are now seeking to cut their losses by subletting floor space. Google was already planning to move the majority of its staff to a new London base but is now reportedly shutting down its former HQ altogether, as well as looking for tenants for its premises. \"Walk round any of those (big tech) offices and there is a huge amount of space given over to non-fee-generating functions which look very generous,\" Chris Lewis, of property company DeVono Cresa, told the FT. \"The amount of space taken was taken by a really ambitious view of headcount.\" The Times newspaper also reports that over a year ago, Facebook's owner Meta agreed a 20-year lease on a high-profile London office, which was interpreted as a sign of business confidence post-pandemic, but as of December 2022, it remains unoccupied, and it has been confirmed that the company will try to sublet it, a situation that is being repeated at its European headquarters in Dublin, for which the company signed a 25-year lease in 2018. The Techradar website said this follows on from the company subletting a building in Austin, Texas, and terminating the leases on two of its three offices in Manhattan. In recent years the growth of the tech sector has been a safe bet for British property investors, so the drying up of demand will hit landlords particularly hard, when combined with rising interest rates. Aaron Guy, a property analyst at Citi, told the Times that over the next couple of years, London office space value could fall by up to one-third, \"driven primarily by recessionary impacts on higher unemployment and continued work-from-home office shrinkage\". The position of another of the big tech companies, Twitter, remains unclear amid the on-going upheaval caused by its recent takeover by Elon Musk, and significant job cuts and calls for remaining staff to return to offices, but the FT noted that the company's real estate vice-president had recently left the organization. More optimistic news comes from TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. Since September 2022, it has insisted that staff be present in the office two to three days a week. And it is reportedly close to agreeing deals to occupy Verdant, a major new office development in the city of London, and expand its presence in Dublin, which has long been a popular destination for tech companies.",

          "By BGSU Marketing & Communications BGSU alumnae Morgan Johnson \u201822 is a graphic designer and illustrator for NASA\u2019s Space Communications and Navigation program. A Bowling Green State University senior and pair of graduates are taking complex and often difficult to understand data at NASA and turning it into straightforward visualizations that communicate the important work of the national space agency. BGSU alumnae Morgan Johnson \u201822 and Heather Monaghan \u201817 are graphic designers and illustrators for NASA\u2019s Space Communications and Navigation program. Olivia Francese, a senior, is a 3D modeling intern in the virtual reality Graphics and Visualization Lab at NASA\u2019s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. Collectively, their digital creations have played an essential part in communicating more broadly to the general public the work at NASA and its wide-ranging impact on society while representing BGSU on a global stage. Heather Monaghan Monaghan, who has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in digital arts from BGSU, is based at the organization\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., though she often works remotely. Monaghan and her team at SCaN enable the success of more than 100 NASA and non-NASA missions, including providing communications and navigation support for major missions like the recent Artemis 1 and James Webb Space Telescope. \u201cMy job is to communicate about communications,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have all these different spacecraft, but nobody really thinks about how we send commands to the spacecraft and how we receive data and images from them. I teach people what we do and how all that works.\u201d As a graphic designer and communications specialist, Monaghan creates graphics, illustrations, posters, social media content and infographics to help make the complexity of NASA\u2019s work intelligible \u2013 and fun \u2013 to those outside the science community. Monaghan said educating the public about the essential work at NASA helps inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and astronauts. Some of Monaghan\u2019s outreach efforts have included comic book illustrations and digital spaced-themed Valentine\u2019s Day cards to appeal to younger generations. She said it\u2019s also important to make people aware of the numerous innovations and technological and scientific advancements developed by NASA. \u201cSpace exploration is a lot more than just space exploration, and most people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cSpace exploration enables technology on Earth.\u201d Monaghan said examples of \u201cspinoffs\u201d \u2013 products or innovations developed from space travel \u2013 include camera phones, scratch-resistant lenses, wireless headphones, memory foam, ear thermometers and more. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have things like that without space exploration,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cThere\u2019s amazing, complex science that\u2019s happening at NASA, but it\u2019s pointless if the public doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. We have to excite them.\u201d Morgan Johnson Johnson, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in digital arts and a minor in biology, was recently hired as a graphics lead for the Glenn Research Center SCaN program office after completing four internships at NASA\u2019s Glenn Research Center. In her new full-time role, Johnson said she\u2019ll continue working with project teams at NASA to portray complex processes and technologies through digital art. \u201cThere are so many highly technical people who are so knowledgeable about what they do, but sometimes we need somebody to translate those messages and meet people where they\u2019re at,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe incredible projects at NASA and in Space Communications and Navigation need to be shared in a way that appeals to people and excites them about the work that\u2019s happening here.\u201d A recent project the Kansas, Ohio, native worked on included an animated video and illustration showing how NASA uses artificial intelligence to reroute communication signals between satellites when there\u2019s interference in the atmosphere. \u201cIn a typical communications relay, when a satellite communicates to a ground station to get data back to Earth, we rely on the communication signals having no interference,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen something interferes with those signals, like clouds or bad weather, cognitive communications technology can use artificial intelligence to reroute those communication signals from one satellite to another as another way of getting that information to the ground and back to us.\u201d Olivia Francese Francese, a BGSU senior from Detroit majoring in digital arts, has a slightly different role than Johnson and Monaghan. She works in the Graphics and Visualization Lab at the Glenn Research Center, creating 3D models used in virtual and augmented reality. Francese said the models of testing facilities she receives \u2013 including the equipment, walls, floors and cursory items inside \u2013 lack real-world color information. It\u2019s her job to add textures, light, shadows and reflections to objects to mimic real life. Recently, she\u2019s been working on an aero-testing facility. Francese said she uses reference photos and notes taken during facility tours to guide her visualization. Once complete, the 3D models are imported into software to create a virtual reality experience, allowing the public a view into facilities they may never see otherwise. \u201cNASA has a very technical vocabulary,\u201d Francese said. \u201cI\u2019m able to take that and visually communicate to the public about what NASA is doing.\u201d Francese works full time as an intern for NASA and is a part-time student at the University. She works remotely for NASA other than Fridays when she travels from Bowling Green to the NASA office in Cleveland. From BGSU to NASA Monaghan was the first of the three Falcons to work at NASA. She interned as a designer and illustrator at the Glenn Research Center in 2018 following her graduation in 2017. Monaghan returned to NASA full time in 2020 and soon after received a message from Johnson, who learned of her experiences when a professor in a digital painting class at BGSU used her art as an example. Johnson reached out to Monaghan for advice on getting an internship at NASA. Monaghan connected Johnson with her current mentor, Molly Kearns, a digital media specialist at NASA, who offered her a shadowing internship in the summer of 2021. Three more internships followed throughout 2021 and 2022. Then, in a pay-it-forward type of moment, Johnson gave a presentation on her internship to the BGSU graphic design club, and Francese was there. The two connected after the presentation, and Johnson put Francese in touch with the right people at NASA, similar to how Monaghan helped her. \u201cI was really fortunate to have met Heather, which ultimately led me to my now full-time career at NASA, and it felt great to be able to do the same for Olivia,\u201d Johnson said. For Monaghan, helping fellow Falcons find success at NASA has been among the most rewarding parts of her career. \u201cIt was this really cool moment of \u2018that used to be me.\u2019 I was the person cold emailing people, asking questions and picking people\u2019s brains,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m able to extend that help to other people, and the fact that they are fellow Falcons makes it even more rewarding.\u201d Quality public education The three women each lauded their quality public education at BGSU and the role it played in preparing them to work at the world\u2019s leading space institution. Monaghan, an out-of-state transfer student, said she arrived at the University with little confidence in her work. Through her classes and with help from attentive professors, she said she slowly started to see herself as an artist. \u201cI had the most wonderful professors who constantly encouraged me and pushed me,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cAt BGSU, the experience of having to constantly present your work and talk about it has been incredibly helpful for me. It was the hardest thing at the time, but that\u2019s basically what I have to do every day now.\u201d Johnson\u2019s decision to minor in biology proved to be incredibly beneficial to her work at NASA. Although she acknowledged biology is not directly related to digital art or space, she said the ability to break down complicated scientific topics into easy-to-understand graphics has been crucial to her success. \u201cIn college, I was always thinking about these complex scientific topics and my own ways to translate them into artwork,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was really helpful to have that experience of taking something that was super complex and showing it visually. That definitely translates to what I do here when working with engineers and scientists.\u201d Francese enrolled at BGSU with plans to pursue digital illustration. That changed after taking an introduction to 3D modeling class. \u201cI just fell in love with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized this is what I want to do.\u201d",

          "The new measures by Australia and Canada are effective from 5 January this year. Australia, and Canada are set to impose restrictions on travellers from China in the wake of spike in Covid-19 cases. So far, more than a dozen countries and territories have imposed similar measures on travellers from China due to significant wave of Covid-19 infections in the country. Australia and Canada mandates negative Covid-19 test results for all passengers travelling from mainland China, including the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Effective from 5 January 2022, travellers to Australia will be required to show negative results for Covid-19 tests taken within the 48hrs prior to travel. Australian Health Minister Mark Butler said: \u201cWhile we are no longer in the emergency phase of the pandemic response in Australia, this decision has been made to safeguard Australia from the risk of potential new emerging variants, and in recognition of the rapidly evolving situation in China and uncertainty about emerging viral variants.\u201d Butler said that the new precautionary and temporary arrangements will be under review based on available information and the health advice. Furthermore, Canada requires negative COVID-19 test results for air travellers two years of age and older. This new 30-day measure is effective from 05 January. In a press statement, the government said: \u201cIn response to the surge of COVID-19 in the People\u2019s Republic of China and given the limited epidemiological and viral genomic sequence data available on these cases, the Government of Canada intends to put in place certain temporary health measures for air travellers entering Canada from China.\u201d \n\t\tThe leading site for news and procurement in the airport industry \n\t\t\t\tPowered by\n\t\t\t\t\n \u00a9 Verdict Media Limited 2023",

          "SpaceX is poised to launch 114 payloads to orbit on a Falcon 9 tomorrow morning, the sixth mission of its smallsat rideshare program. But while the rocket company is now an old hand at launches \u2013 SpaceX just completed a record year with 61 launches in 2022 alone \u2013 for a handful of space startups, Transporter-6 marks a milestone. Those startups include Launcher, which is conducting its first space tug mission; an inaugural in-orbit tech demonstration from Magdrive; and Epic Aerospace, which is also launching a space tug for the first time. Launcher CEO Max Haot told TechCrunch that the company realized that there was a big market opportunity to develop a space tug after SpaceX debuted its rideshare program, which dramatically lowered the cost of launch. Launcher\u2019s tug, called Orbiter, will deploy or host payload for 10 separate customers. The company is also developing a small launch vehicle; Orbiter will be its third stage. Space tugs are filling a market segment for customers that need a specific orbit but want to pay less than the cost of a dedicated rocket launch, Haot said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a need eventually for a dedicated rocket if you need a specific orbit at a higher price, and eventually we\u2019ll compete there, but the space tug really helps make these rideshare flights more useful since you can reach more than just one orbit,\u201d he said. Launcher isn\u2019t the only company that has its eye on the emerging space tug market. Epic Aerospace, which bills itself as a space transportation network company, will also be launching a tug on Transporter-6 for the first time. Space services companies Momentus, D-Orbit and Exolaunch will also be deploying or hosting satellites for customers on this mission. It may seem like the space tug market is already crowded with players, but Haot said the ultimate winners are far from decided.

But if you look at the customers, this is very new and no one has yet really demonstrated a big transfer capability that\u2019s useful to satellite companies,\u201d he said. Magdrive, a UK-based startup developing a high-thrust spacecraft propulsion engine, will also be going to space for the first time for an in-orbit technology demonstration. The prototype propulsion system will draw in power from onboard solar panels, store it, and discharge it at varying power levels. \u201cThe mission lasts 12 months, but we\u2019ll be aiming to try as many charge and discharge options as soon as possible so we get as much data as we can,\u201d Magdrive CEO Mark Stokes told TechCrunch. Transporter-6 is set to take-off at 9:56 AM EST from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the fifteenth flight of the Falcon 9 booster dubbed B1060. Transporter-6 will also carry satellites for Planet Labs and Spire Global, as well as other payloads for scientific, research and commercial customers. The launch will be streamed live on SpaceX\u2019s website.",
