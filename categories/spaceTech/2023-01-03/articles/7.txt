Saying farewell to 2022: Here‚Äôs what happened in the retail technology space during December ‚Äî Retail Technology Innovation Hub
Sook, Walmart, Ribble Cycles, Obsess, Jisp, B&Q, Cart.com, Compass Group, AiFi, Pets at Home, and TPP Retail were among the companies who emerged victorious at RTIH‚Äôs 2022 retail technology awards. Now into their fourth year, the awards celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world. We received a record number of submissions this year across 14 categories (you can find a full rundown of the 2022 shortlists here). Our winners and highly commended companies were announced during a sold out event that took place in central London during December and was attended by retailers, tech suppliers, members of our judging panel, and sponsors. So, without further ado, here is the 2022 RTIH Innovation Awards hall of fame. Congratulations to our latest entrants! 2022 RTIH Innovation Awards winners announced. Take a bow @SookSpaces @fashinza_ @AiFiInc @BandQ @Marxent @Walmart @Secretsales @RibbleCycles @Volumental @Rotageek @obsessVR @hyperfinity @OcularTech @cartdotcom @PetsatHome @jispapp @Red_Ant @Retail247_ https://t.co/L58js3Wx0C Chatermill research, based on customer reviews, revealed delivery to be one of the biggest issues for retail customers, with speed and timeliness being key contributors to the negative sentiment received by some of the most popular fashion retail brands. Chattermill analysed feedback from over 152,000 public Trustpilot reviews, registered from 1st January to 4th September, from customers buying at Asos, H&M, New Look, Next and Zara.  Based on ratings given by customers, New Look and Asos had the best customer experience, while Zara had the worst. Delivery complaints frequently centre on the fact that despite stating on their websites a limited number of days for delivering purchases ‚Äî usually around two to four days ‚Äî packages tend to be delayed, with items frequently arriving out of the suggested timeframe. An explanation for this could be linked to the courier service used by the fashion brands analysed.  Based on the feedback collected from customers, Evri (formerly Hermes) is the most problematic courier brand, followed by DHL and Yodel in number of negative reviews.  Registrations for Retail Technology Show 2023 are now open. The show will take place at London‚Äôs Olympia on 26th-27th April. New for 2023, a newly expanded show floor will see the Retail Technology Show showcase even more cutting-edge tech.  It will add an additional 2,000m2 of exhibition space by expanding into Olympia‚Äôs National Hall in addition to the Grand Hall that hosted last year‚Äôs show. 300+ innovators ‚Äì from tech‚Äôs biggest players, fast growth disruptors and startups - will showcase their solutions.

The super fast grocery delivery industry will steadily grow for many years to come and Getir will lead this category it created seven years ago,‚Äù says Nazim Salur, Getir founder. The amount of VC money burnt investing in the quick commerce space is staggering.  With this latest move, can we assume that one startup will survive and thrive, alongside traditional retailers like Tesco who saw what was going on and came up with their own offerings? The latest Trigo powered REWE store went live in central Munich.  The REWE Pick&Go location is in the Maxvorstadt neighbourhood, which is also known as the cultural heart of Munich.  This high traffic area is only a few minutes‚Äô walk from the city‚Äôs central train station, museums, and galleries, and some of Germany‚Äôs top universities, making it a good location for both REWE and Germany‚Äôs first ever 100% autonomous store. In an online post, Michael Gabay, CEO at Trigo, said: ‚ÄúThis store is a product of the close and long standing partnership between REWE and Trigo, who, together, created effective and efficient processes over time that serve as a model for additional store expansion.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúOpening the first fully autonomous store in Germany makes a bold statement in the retail industry.

In a LInkedIn post, he said: ‚ÄúOne of the things that excited me most about joining Amazon is the company‚Äôs customer obsessed mindset.
