• The Alar Fascia is an often-overlooked anatomical area that functions to anchor the neck muscles.
• This structure can be prone to developing trigger points and dysfunction, which can lead to postural problems, tension headaches and a variety of other conditions.
• To ensure proper treatment for this condition, it is important for physicians to have a thorough understanding of the anatomy and functioning of the alar fascia.
• The danger space in relation to the alar fascia refers specifically to an area located between two layers of deep cervical muscles - superior oblique (SO) and middle scalene (MS). 
• The danger space serves as a pathway for vessels and nerves passing from posterior cervicomediastinal regions into anterior cervical areas. 
• Recognizing potential pathologies associated with the danger space can help prevent serious neurological complications such as Horner’s Syndrome or brachial plexus injury due to improper injection techniques.

-In Space, 2022 was marked by steady progress in commercialization and militarization while the Pentagon grappled with how best to address both. 
-The Biden administration took a few “baby steps” towards forming its space policy: recognizing arms control as an important step to minimizing risk of conflict, creating a Space Force that is more agile than traditional military services, and launching an independent review into US national security space activities. 
-These developments reflect the growing consensus that space needs greater oversight due to the increasing reliance on satellites for communication and information gathering. 
-Meanwhile, private companies such as SpaceX continue to make strides in providing access to low earth orbit for countries who previously lacked it. This has made it easier for nations with limited resources or capabilities to enter the market without having their own infrastructure. 
Daily Briefing: 
• 2022 saw continued progress made in commercializing and militarizing space activities; meanwhile Pentagon attempted to identify proper response strategies related thereto.  
• Biden Administration began taking small steps towards defining its official stance on matters of space policy including promotion of arms control measures, creation of new agility focused "Space Force", launch of independent review process concerning US security activity within said domain etc.   
• Growing recognition indicating necessity increased oversight over use/manipulation involving satellites being used for communication/data gathering purposes witnessed among global community members; private sector organizations such as SpaceX continuing successful development aiding those lacking required technological infrastructure gain access thereto).
