After text-to-image tools from Stability AI and OpenAI became the talk of the town, ChatGPT’s ability to hold intelligent conversations is the new obsession in sectors across the board.</p>
<p>In China, where the tech community has always watched progress in the West closely, entrepreneurs, researchers, and investors are looking for ways to make their dent in the generative AI space. Tech firms are devising tools built on open source models to attract consumer and enterprise customers. Individuals are cashing in on AI-generated content. Regulators have responded quickly to define how text, image, and video synthesis should be used. Meanwhile, U.S. tech sanctions are raising concerns about China’s ability to keep up with AI advancement.</p>
<p>As generative AI takes the world by storm towards the end of 2022, let’s take a look at how this explosive technology is shaking out in China.</p>
<h2>Chinese flavors</h2>
<p>Thanks to viral art creation platforms like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2, generative AI is suddenly on everyone’s lips. Halfway across the world, Chinese tech giants have also captivated the public with their equivalent products, adding a twist to suit the country’s tastes and political climate.</p>
<p>Baidu, which made its name in search engines and has in recent years been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/26/baidu-night-time-driverless-robotaxis-china/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stepping up its game in autonomous driving</a>, operates<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE-ViLG" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> ERNIE-ViLG</a>, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15283" rel="noopener" target="_blank">10-billion parameter model</a> trained on a data set of 145 million Chinese image-text pairs. How does it fair against its American counterpart? Below are the results from the prompt “kids eating shumai in New York Chinatown” given to Stable Diffusion, versus the same prompt in Chinese (纽约唐人街小孩吃烧卖) for ERNIE-ViLG.</p>

<p>As someone who grew up eating dim sum in China and Chinatowns, I’d say the results are a tie. Neither got the right shumai, which, in the dim sum context, is a type of <a href="https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/restaurants/the-best-siu-mai-in-hong-kong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">succulent, shrimp and pork dumpling in a half-open yellow wrapping</a>. While Stable Diffusion nails the atmosphere of a Chinatown dim sum eatery, its shumai is off (but I see where the machine is going). And while ERNIE-ViLG does generate<em> a</em> type of shumai, it’s a variety more commonly seen in eastern China rather than the Cantonese version.</p>
<p>The quick test reflects the difficulty in capturing cultural nuances when the data sets used are inherently biased — assuming Stable Diffusion would have more data on the Chinese diaspora and ERNIE-ViLG probably is trained on a greater variety of shumai images that are rarer outside China.</p>
<p>Another Chinese tool that has made noise is Tencent’s <a href="https://pandaily.com/tencents-anime-ai-picture-generator-hits-global-social-platforms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Different Dimension Me</a>, which can turn photos of people into anime characters. The AI generator exhibits its own bias. Intended for Chinese users, it took off unexpectedly in other anime-loving regions like South America. But users soon realized the platform failed to identify black and plus-size individuals, groups that are noticeably missing in Japanese anime, leading to offensive AI-generated results.</p>

<p>Aside from ERNIE-ViLG, another large-scale Chinese text-to-image model is <a href="https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Taiyi-Stable-Diffusion-1B-Chinese-v0.1?text=%E5%AD%A4%E8%88%9F%E8%93%91%E7%AC%A0%E7%BF%81%EF%BC%8C%E7%8B%AC%E9%92%93%E5%AF%92%E6%B1%9F%E9%9B%AA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taiyi</a>, a brainchild of IDEA, a research lab<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/harry-shum-microsoft-digital-finance-china/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> led by renowned computer scientist Harry Shum</a>, who co-founded Microsoft’s largest research branch outside the U.S., Microsoft Research Asia. The open source AI model is trained on 20 million filtered Chinese image-text pairs and has one billion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTE2KlfoO3Q&amp;ab_channel=DeepLearningAI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">parameters</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Baidu and other profit-driven tech firms, IDEA is one of a handful of institutions backed by local governments in recent years to work on cutting-edge technologies. That means the center probably enjoys more research freedom without the pressure to drive commercial success. Based in the tech hub of Shenzhen and supported by one of China’s wealthiest cities, it’s an up-and-coming outfit worth watching.</p>
<h2>Rules of AI</h2>
<p>China’s generative AI tools aren’t just characterized by the domestic data they learn from; they are also shaped by local laws. As MIT Technology Review <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/14/1059481/baidu-chinese-image-ai-tiananmen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, Baidu’s text-to-image model filters out politically sensitive keywords. That’s expected, given censorship has long been a universal practice on the Chinese internet.</p>
<p>What’s more significant to the future of the fledgling field is the new set of regulatory measures targeting what the government dubs “deep synthesis tech”, which denotes “technology that uses deep learning, virtual reality, and other synthesis algorithms to generate text, images, audio, video, and virtual scenes.”As with other types of internet services in China, from games to social media, users are asked to verify their names before using generative AI apps. The fact that prompts can be traced to one’s real identity inevitably has a restrictive impact on user behavior.</p>
<p>But on the bright side, these rules could lead to more responsible use of generative AI, which is already being abused elsewhere to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/26/what-to-expect-from-ai-in-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> churn out NSFW and sexist content</a>. The Chinese regulation, for example, explicitly bans people from generating and spreading AI-created fake news. How that will be implemented, though, lies with the service providers.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting that China is at the forefront of trying to regulate [generative AI] as a country,” said Yoav Shoham, founder of AI21 Labs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/openai-rival-ai21-labs-raises-64m-to-ramp-up-its-ai-powered-language-services/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an Israel-based OpenAI rival</a>, in an interview. “There are various companies that are putting limits to AI… Every country I know of has efforts to regulate AI or to somehow make sure that the legal system, or the social system, is keeping up with the technology, specifically about regulating the automatic generation of content.”</p>
<p>But there’s no consensus as to how the fast-changing field should be governed, yet. “I think it’s an area we’re all learning together,” Shoham admitted. “It has to be a collaborative effort. It has to involve technologists who actually understand the technology and what it does and what it doesn’t do, the public sector, social scientists, and people who are impacted by the technology as well as the government, including the sort of commercial and legal aspect of the regulation.”</p>
<h2>Monetizing AI</h2>
<p>As artists fret over being replaced by powerful AI, many in China are leveraging machine learning algorithms to make money in a plethora of ways. They aren’t from the most tech-savvy crowd. Rather, they are opportunists or stay-home mums looking for an extra source of income. They realize that by improving their prompts, <a href="https://www.163.com/dy/article/HGOB9LPI05539POX.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they can trick AI into making creative emojis or stunning wallpapers</a>, which they can post on social media to drive ad revenues or directly charge for downloads. The really skilled ones are also selling their prompts to others who want to join the money-making game — or even train them for a fee.</p>
<p>Others in China are using AI in their formal jobs like<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/technology/ai-generated-art-jobs-dall-e-2.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> the rest of the world</a>. Light fiction writers, for instance, can cheaply churn out illustrations for their works, a genre that is shorter than novels and often features illustrations. An intriguing use case that can potentially disrupt realms of manufacturing is using AI to design T-shirts, press-on nails, and prints for other consumer goods. By generating large batches of prototypes quickly, manufacturers save on design costs and shorten their production cycle.</p>
<p>It’s too early to know how differently generative AI is developing in China and the West. But entrepreneurs have made decisions based on their early observation. A few founders told me that businesses and professionals are generally happy to pay for AI because they see a direct return on investment, so startups are eager to carve out industry use cases. One clever application came from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/surreal-profile/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sequoia China-backed Surreal</a> (later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/movio-marketing-videos-generative-ai/">renamed to Movio</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/zmo-ai-generate-human-8-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hillhouse-backed ZMO.ai</a>, which discovered during the pandemic that e-commerce sellers were struggling to find foreign models as China kept its borders shut. The solution? The two companies worked on algorithms that generated fashion models of all shapes, colors, and races.</p>
<p>But some entrepreneurs don’t believe their AI-powered SaaS will see the type of skyrocketing valuation and meteoric growth their Western counterparts, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/ai-content-platform-jasper-raises-125m-at-a-1-7b-valuation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jasper</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/stability-ai-the-startup-behind-stable-diffusion-raises-101m/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stability AI</a>, are enjoying. Over the years, numerous Chinese startups have told me they have the same concern: China’s enterprise customers are generally less willing to pay for SaaS than those in developed economies, which is why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/pacdora-packaging-design-platform-canva-figma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many of them start expanding overseas</a>.</p>
<p>Competition in China’s SaaS space is also dog-eat-dog. “In the U.S., you can do fairly well by building product-led software, which doesn’t rely on human services to acquire or retain users. But in China, even if you have a great product, your rival could steal your source code overnight and hire dozens of customer support staff, which don’t cost that much, to outrace you,” said a founder of a Chinese generative AI startup, requesting anonymity.</p>
<p>Shi Yi, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.myflashcloud.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sales intelligence startup FlashCloud</a>, agreed that Chinese companies often prioritize short-term returns over long-term innovation. “In regard to talent development, Chinese tech firms tend to be more focused on getting skilled at applications and generating quick money,” he said. One Shanghai-based investor, who declined to be named, said he was “a bit disappointed that major breakthroughs in generative AI this year are all happening outside China.”</p>

<h2>Roadblocks ahead</h2>
<p>Even when Chinese tech firms want to invest in training large neural networks, they might lack the best tools. In September, the U.S. government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/02/china-us-nvidia-export-ban/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">slapped China with export controls on high-end AI chips</a>. While many Chinese AI startups are focused on the application front and don’t need high-performance semiconductors that handle seas of data, for those doing basic research, using less powerful chips means computing will take longer and cost more, said an enterprise software investor at a top Chinese VC firm, requesting anonymity. The good news is, he argued, such sanctions are pushing China to invest in advanced technologies over the long run.</p>
<p>As a company that bills itself as a leader in China’s AI field, Baidu believes the impact of U.S. chip sanction on its AI business is “limited” both in the short and longer term, said the firm’s executive vice president and head of AI Cloud Group, Dou Shen, on its <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/22/baidu-bidu-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Q3 earnings call</a>. That’s because “a large portion” of Baidu’s AI cloud business “does not rely too much on the highly advanced chips.” And in cases where it does need high-end chips, it has “already stocked enough in hand, actually, to support our business in the near term.”</p>
<p>What about the future? “When we look at it at a mid- to a longer-term, we actually have our own developed AI chip, so named <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-18/baidu-s-chip-affiliate-eyes-fundraise-at-2-5-billion-valuation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kunlun</a>,” the executive said confidently. “By using our Kunlun chips [Inaudible] in large language models, the efficiency to perform text and image recognition tasks on our AI platform has been improved by 40% and the total cost has been reduced by 20% to 30%.”</p>
<p>Time will tell if Kunlun and other indigenous AI chips will give China an edge in the generative AI race.</p>

These are just some of the ways police and prosecutors around the world took down the biggest cybercrime operations of the year, even if it meant resorting to new and unconventional eyebrow-raising methods. From stashing billions of bitcoin under the floorboards to teenage hackers gatecrashing Fortune 500 networks, this year saw some of the most jaw-dropping breaches \u2014 and the highest-profile apprehensions.<\/p>\n<p>As we close out 2022, we look back at the cybercriminals we lost this year \u2026 to the law.<\/p>\n<h2>Sanctions and seizures hit the crypto scene<\/h2>\n<p>U.S. officials scored some major wins against crypto-laundering in 2022. At the beginning of the year, the Justice Department said it had seized more than $3.6 billion worth of bitcoins allegedly stolen in the 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex and that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/08\/married-tech-entrepreneurs-arrested-charged-with-laundering-funds-from-bitfinex-crypto-hack\/\">it had arrested a married couple suspected of laundering the money<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The couple \u2014 Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and Heather Morgan, 31 \u2014 face up to 25 years in prison if convicted on charges of conspiring to launder money and defrauding the U.S. government.<\/p>\n<p>Later in the year, the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), a watchdog within the U.S. Treasury tasked with enforcing sanctions violations, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/08\/treasury-tornado-cash-laundering-stolen-crypto\/\">announced<\/a> that it had sanctioned decentralized cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash for its role in enabling billions of dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency to be laundered through its platform.<\/p>\n<p>Tornado Cash, along with other mixers such as AlphaBay, allows customers to conceal the source of their crypto funds when participating in a transaction in exchange for a fee. It blends <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/30\/north-korea-lazarus-harmony-theft\/\">potentially identifiable or tainted cryptocurrency funds<\/a> with others to obfuscate the source and destination of crypto assets. More than $1.5 billion in proceeds of crime, like ransomware and fraud, has been laundered through Tornado Cash to date, experts estimate.<\/p>\n<h2>U.S. doxes alleged Conti ransomware member<\/h2>\n<p>In August, the U.S government <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/12\/state-conti-ransomware-intelligence\/\">shared an image<\/a> of a suspected Conti ransomware operator known as \u201cTarget,\u201d the first time it has outed a major ransomware actor. The program also offered up to $10 million for information leading to the identification and location of Target, along with four other alleged Conti members known as \u201cTramp,\u201d \u201cDandis,\u201d \u201cProfessor\u201d and \u201cReshaev.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The State Department said Conti has carried out more than 1,000 ransomware operations targeting U.S. and international critical infrastructure.

Between August 2019 and January 2021, ransomware attacks involving NetWalker pulled $46 million in ransom payments, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chainalysis.com\/reports\/netwalker-ransomware-disruption-arrest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cryptocurrency analysis firm Chainalysis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In October, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, a 34-year-old from Quebec, was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/05\/netwalker-affiliate-sentenced\/\">sentenced in a Florida court in October<\/a> after pleading guilty to charges related to his involvement with NetWalker. Vachon-Desjardins, who worked as an IT consultant for Public Works and Government Services in Canada, was previously arrested by Canadian police in January 2021 and sentenced to seven years in prison. During a search of his home, law enforcement officials discovered and seized 719 bitcoin and $790,000 in Canadian currency.<\/p>\n<h2>James Zhong, the hacker who stole billions of Silk Road&#8217;s bitcoin<\/h2>\n<p>In a surprising yet anticlimactic conclusion to one of the government&#8217;s longest-running cyber cases, the mystery of the notorious dark web drugs marketplace Silk Road&#8217;s missing billions was solved. In November, U.S. federal agents said it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/07\/us-doj-announces-seizure-of-3-36b-in-cryptocurrency\/\">found $3.36 billion worth of bitcoin<\/a> that had been stashed in a popcorn can under the bathroom closet floorboards in the home of the hacker nearly a decade earlier. Prosecutors brought charges against the hacker, a Georgia resident named James Zhong, whose plea agreement with the feds saw him forfeit the huge cache of cryptocurrency, along with $600,000 in cash and other precious metals.<\/p>\n<p>Somewhat confusingly, Zhong is the second hacker to have ultimately turned over Silk Road&#8217;s stolen billions \u2014 albeit at a lower exchange rate than today. In 2020, a hacker who went by the alias <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/justice-department-silk-road-billion-bitcoin\/\">Individual X forfeited another huge cache of Silk Road&#8217;s bitcoin<\/a> that they had stolen years earlier during a hacking spree over 2012 and 2013. The Justice Department&#8217;s latest forfeiture closed the door on another billion-dollar mystery, even if the feds kept secret how the funds were stolen or how they came to find the hacker, long after Silk Road&#8217;s founder Ross Ulbricht was jailed.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2463362\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2463362\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2463362 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1119\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg?resize=300,224 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg?resize=768,573 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg?resize=680,507 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg?resize=1200,895 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/zhong-bitcoin-doj-2.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2463362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The partial contents of the popcorn can, containing memory cards with billions of cryptocurrency and other precious metals. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Justice Dept.

Mark Sokolovsky, who goes by the online handle \u201craccoonstealer,\u201d is accused of having a major role as a key administrator of the malware, which prosecutors say was used to steal more than 50 million unique credentials and forms of identification from victims around the world since February 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Sokolovsky is charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft and faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Sokolovsky is in Amsterdam awaiting extradition to the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Sokolvsky\u2019s arrest led to an uptick in new Mars Stealer campaigns, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/cert.gov.ua\/article\/38606\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mass-targeting of Ukraine<\/a> in the weeks following Russia\u2019s invasion and a large-scale effort to infect victims by malicious ads. However, in November, a security research and hacking startup told TechCrunch that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/22\/mars-stealers-flaw-lock-out\/\">it had found a coding flaw<\/a> that allows it to lock out operators of the Mars Stealer malware from their own servers and release their victims.<\/p>\n<h2>\u200b\u200bSeller of WhatsApp-hacking tech pleads guilty<\/h2>\n<p>Signal jammers, Wi-Fi interception tools and WhatsApp hacking tools. These are some of the things that one Mexican businessman <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/16\/spyware-dealer-whatsapp-hack-guilty\/\">admitted in federal court<\/a> to selling for both commercial and personal reasons. The Justice Department accused Carlos Guerrero of, among other things, arranging the sale of hacking tools to Mexican politicians and using other equipment he sold to intercept the phone calls of a U.S. rival. It goes to show that it&#8217;s not <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/05\/nso-pegasus-jordan-apple\/\">just nation states and governments<\/a> with powerful phone spying technology at their disposal.<\/p>\n<h2>Lapsus$ rounded up once, twice<\/h2>\n<p>The Lapsus$ gang rose to notoriety in 2022. The data extortion group, which first emerged a year earlier, quickly claimed a number of high-profile victims, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/28\/lapsus-passwords-okta-breach\/\">Okta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/23\/microsoft-lapsus-hack-source-code\/\">Microsoft<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/04\/nvidia-ransomware-hackers-demands\/\">Nvidia<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/07\/samsung-breach-source-code\/\">Samsung<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While the gang once seemed invincible, a number of its members <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/london-police-lapsus-arrests\/\">were arrested<\/a> in March this year. In a statement given to TechCrunch at the time, City of London Police confirmed that seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 had been arrested in connection with Lapsus$.<\/p>\n<p>News of the arrests came just hours <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-03-23\/teen-suspected-by-cyber-researchers-of-being-lapsus-mastermind?sref=gni836kR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">after a Bloomberg report<\/a> revealed a teenager based in Oxfordshire, U.K. is suspected of being the mastermind of the Lapsus$ group. Researchers investigating the gang\u2019s recent hacks said they believed the 16-year-old, who uses the online moniker \u201cWhite\u201d or \u201cBreachbase,\u201d was a leading figure in Lapsus$. Bloomberg was able to track down the suspected hacker after his personal information was published online by rival hackers. Weeks later, U.K. police said they had charged two of the teenagers with multiple cyber offenses.<\/p>\n<h2>SSNDOB, a marketplace for stolen Social Security numbers, is no more<\/h2>\n<p>U.S. officials in June <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/08\/fbi-ssndob-millions-social-security-marketplace\/\">announced<\/a> the takedown of SSNDOB, a notorious marketplace used for trading the personal information \u2014 including Social Security numbers, or SSNs \u2014 of millions of Americans.<\/p>\n<p>The landmark operation was carried out by the FBI, IRS and the DOJ, with help from the Cyprus Police, and saw authorities seize four domains hosting the SSNDOB marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>SSNDOB listed the personal information for approximately 24 million individuals in the United States, including names, dates of birth, SSNs and credit card numbers and generated more than $19 million in revenue, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-mdfl\/pr\/ssndob-marketplace-series-websites-listed-more-20-million-social-security-numbers-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to prosecutors<\/a>.

videos.\u00a0A new website, <a href=\"http:\/\/quickvid.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QuickVid<\/a>, combines several generative AI systems into a single tool for automatically creating short-form YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat videos.<\/p>\n<p>Given as little as a single word, QuickVid chooses a background video from a library, writes a script and keywords, overlays images generated by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/dall-e\/\">DALL-E 2<\/a>\u00a0and adds a synthetic voiceover and background music from YouTube&#8217;s royalty-free music library. QuickVid&#8217;s creator, Daniel Habib, says that he&#8217;s building the service to help creators meet the &#8220;ever-growing&#8221; demand from their fans.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By providing creators with tools to quickly and easily produce quality content, QuickVid helps creators increase their content output, reducing the risk of burnout,&#8221; Habib told TechCrunch in an email interview. &#8220;Our goal is to empower your favorite creator to keep up with the demands of their audience by leveraging advancements in AI.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But depending on how they&#8217;re used, tools like QuickVid threaten to flood already-crowded channels with spammy and duplicative content. They also face potential backlash from creators who opt not to use the tools, whether because of cost ($10 per month) or on principle, yet might have to compete with a raft of new AI-generated videos.<\/p>\n<h2>Going after video<\/h2>\n<p>QuickVid, which Habib, a self-taught developer who previously worked at Meta on Facebook Live and video infrastructure, built in a matter of weeks, launched on December 27. It&#8217;s relatively bare bones at present &#8212; Habib says that more personalization options will arrive in January &#8212; but QuickVid can cobble together the components that make up a typical informational YouTube Short or TikTok video, including captions and even avatars.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to use. First, a user enters a prompt describing the subject matter of the video they want to create. QuickVid uses the prompt to generate a script, leveraging the generative text powers of GPT-3. From keywords either extracted from the script automatically or entered manually, QuickVid selects a background video from the royalty-free stock media library Pexels and generates overlay images using DALL-E 2. It then outputs a voiceover via Google Cloud&#8217;s text-to-speech API &#8212; Habib says that users will soon be able to clone their voice &#8212; before combining all these elements into a video.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2463572\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2463572\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2463572\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/screencapture-quickvid-ai-templates-shorts-maker-2022-12-30-15_09_25-e1672436044977.png\" alt=\"QuickVid\" width=\"1024\" height=\"517\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2463572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> QuickVid<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>See this video made with the prompt &#8220;Cats&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 360px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2463471-1\" width=\"360\" height=\"640\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_5pg7k95x9ig2tofh7mkrr_cfr.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_5pg7k95x9ig2tofh7mkrr_cfr.mp4\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_5pg7k95x9ig2tofh7mkrr_cfr.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Or this one:<\/p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 360px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2463471-2\" width=\"360\" height=\"640\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_61ighv4x55slq9582dbx_cfr.mp4?_=2\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_61ighv4x55slq9582dbx_cfr.mp4\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_61ighv4x55slq9582dbx_cfr.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/p>\n<p>QuickVid certainly isn&#8217;t pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible with generative AI. Both Meta and Google have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/05\/google-answers-metas-video-generating-ai-with-its-own-dubbed-imagen-video\/\">showcased<\/a> AI systems that can generate completely original clips given a text prompt. But QuickVid amalgamates existing AI to exploit the repetitive, templated format of B-roll-heavy short-form videos, getting around the problem of having to generate the footage itself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Successful creators have an extremely high-quality bar and aren&#8217;t interested in putting out content that they don&#8217;t feel is in their own voice,&#8221; Habib said. &#8220;This is the use case we&#8217;re focused on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That supposedly being the case, in terms of quality, QuickVid&#8217;s videos are generally a mixed bag. The background videos tend to be a bit random or only tangentially related to the topic, which isn&#8217;t surprising given QuickVids being currently limited to the Pexels catalog. The DALL-E 2-generated images, meanwhile, exhibit the limitations of today&#8217;s text-to-image tech, like garbled text and off proportions.<\/p>\n<p>In response to my feedback, Habib said that QuickVid is &#8220;being tested and tinkered with daily.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Copyright issues<\/h2>\n<p>According to Habib, QuickVid users retain the right to use the content they create commercially and have permission to monetize it on platforms like YouTube. But the copyright status around AI-generated content is \u2026 nebulous, at least presently. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbr.com\/ai-comic-deemed-ineligible-copyright-protection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moved<\/a> to revoke copyright protection for an AI-generated comic, for example, saying copyrightable works require human authorship.<\/p>\n<p>When asked about how the USPTO decision might affect QuickVid, Habib said he believes that it only pertain to the &#8220;patentability&#8221; of AI-generated products and not the rights of creators to use and monetize their content. Creators, he pointed out, aren&#8217;t often submitting patents for videos and usually lean into the creator economy, letting other creators repurpose their clips to increase their own reach.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Creators care about putting out high-quality content in their voice that will help grow their channel,&#8221; Habib said.<\/p>\n<p>Another legal challenge on the horizon might affect QuickVid&#8217;s DALL-E 2 integration &#8212; and, by extension, the site&#8217;s ability to generate image overlays. Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI are being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/11\/8\/23446821\/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sued<\/a> in a class action lawsuit that accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Copilot, a code-generating system, to regurgitate sections of licensed code without providing credit. (Copilot was co-developed by OpenAI and GitHub, which Microsoft owns.) The case has implications for generative art AI like DALL-E 2, which similarly has been found to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/13\/image-generating-ai-can-copy-and-paste-from-training-data-raising-ip-concerns\/\">copy and paste<\/a> from the datasets on which they were trained (i.e., images).<\/p>\n<p>Habib isn&#8217;t concerned, arguing that the generative AI genie&#8217;s out of the bottle. &#8220;If another lawsuit showed up and OpenAI disappeared tomorrow, there are several alternatives that could power QuickVid,&#8221; he said, referring to the open source DALL-E 2-like system <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/stable-diffusion\/\">Stable Diffusion<\/a>. QuickVid is already testing Stable Diffusion for generating avatar pics.<\/p>\n<h2>Moderation and spam<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from the legal dilemmas, QuickVid might soon have a moderation problem on its hands. While OpenAI has implemented filters and techniques to prevent them, generative AI has well-known toxicity and factual accuracy problems. GPT-3 spouts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/12\/10\/technology\/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">misinformation<\/a>, particularly about recent events, which are beyond the boundaries of its knowledge base. And ChatGPT, a fine-tuned offspring of GPT-3, has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bleepingcomputer.com\/news\/technology\/openais-new-chatgpt-bot-10-dangerous-things-its-capable-of\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shown<\/a> to use sexist and racist language.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s worrisome, particularly for people who&#8217;d use QuickVid to create informational videos. In a quick test, I had my partner &#8212; who&#8217;s far more creative than me, particularly in this area &#8212;\u00a0 enter a few offensive prompts to see what QuickVid would generate. To QuickVid&#8217;s credit, obviously problematic prompts like &#8220;Jewish new world order&#8221; and &#8220;9\/11 conspiracy theory&#8221; didn&#8217;t yield toxic scripts. But for &#8220;Critical race theory indoctrinating students,&#8221; QuickVid generated a video implying that critical race theory could be used to brainwash schoolchildren.<\/p>\n<p>See:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2463573\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/screencapture-quickvid-ai-templates-shorts-maker-2022-12-30-15_27_08-e1672435958696.png\" alt=\"QuickVid\" width=\"1024\" height=\"529\" \/><\/p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 240px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2463471-3\" width=\"240\" height=\"426\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_e4wba39us0vqtc8051491_cfr.mp4?_=3\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_e4wba39us0vqtc8051491_cfr.mp4\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/img_e4wba39us0vqtc8051491_cfr.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Habib says that he&#8217;s relying on OpenAI&#8217;s filters to do most of the moderation work and asserts that it&#8217;s incumbent on users to manually review every video created by QuickVid to ensure &#8220;everything is within the boundaries of the law.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As a general rule, I believe people should be able to express themselves and create whatever content they want,&#8221; Habib said.<\/p>\n<p>That apparently includes spammy content. Habib makes the case that the video platforms&#8217; algorithms, not QuickVid, are best positioned to determine the quality of a video, and that people who produce low-quality content &#8220;are only damaging their own reputations.&#8221; The reputational damage will naturally disincentivize people from creating mass spam campaigns with QuickVid, he says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If people don&#8217;t want to watch your video, then you won&#8217;t receive distribution on platforms like YouTube,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Producing low-quality content will also make people look at your channel in a negative light.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s instructive to look at ad agencies like Fractl, which in 2019 used an AI system called Grover to generate an entire site of marketing materials &#8212; reputation be damned. In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/7\/2\/19063562\/ai-text-generation-spam-marketing-seo-fractl-grover-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview<\/a> with The Verge, Fractl partner Kristin Tynski said that she foresaw generative AI enabling &#8220;a massive tsunami of computer-generated content across every niche imaginable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In any case, video-sharing platforms like TikTok and YouTube haven&#8217;t had to contend with moderating AI-generated content on a massive scale. Deepfakes &#8212; synthetic videos that replace an existing person with someone else&#8217;s likeness &#8212; began to populate platforms like YouTube several years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/04\/an-optimistic-view-of-deepfakes\/\">driven by tools<\/a> that made deepfaked footage easier to produce. But unlike even the most convincing deepfakes today, the types of videos QuickVid creates aren&#8217;t obviously AI-generated in any way.<\/p>\n<p>Google Search&#8217;s policy on AI-generated text might be a preview of what&#8217;s to come in the video domain. Google doesn&#8217;t treat synthetic text differently from human-written text where it concerns search rankings but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-automatically-generated-content-against-guidelines-when-intended-to-manipulate-search-rankings-33243.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">takes actions<\/a> on content that&#8217;s &#8220;intended to manipulate search rankings and not help users.&#8221; That includes content stitched together or combined from different web pages that &#8220;[doesn&#8217;t] add sufficient value&#8221; as well as content generated through purely automated processes, both of which might apply to QuickVid.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, AI-generated videos might not be banned from platforms outright should they take off in a major way but rather simply become the cost of doing business. That isn&#8217;t likely to allay the fears of experts who believe that platforms like TikTok are becoming a new home for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2022\/02\/25\/1083255054\/tiktok-sees-a-surge-of-misleading-videos-that-claim-to-show-the-invasion-of-ukra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">misleading<\/a> videos, but &#8212; as Habib said during the interview &#8212; &#8220;there is no stopping the generative AI revolution.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Generative AI is coming for videos.\u00a0A new website, QuickVid, combines several generative AI systems into a single tool for automatically creating short-form YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat videos.

but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. We recently sat down with three VCs to figure out the best way to go about spinning up an investing network from scratch and negotiating the first term sheet.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week, we featured the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/28\/how-to-spin-up-vc\/\">first part<\/a> of that conversation with James Norman of Black Operator Ventures, Mandela Schumacher-Hodge Dixon of AllRaise and Kevin Liu of both Techstars and Uncharted Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>In part two, the investors cover more specifics about what to ask for in a term sheet and red flags you should look out for.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.)<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Why should you know what\u2019s going to be in a term sheet before you see it?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Mandela Schumacher-Hodge Dixon:<\/strong> Do not wait until you get a term sheet to start going back and forth. The term sheet should be a reflection of what was already verbally agreed upon, including the valuation. Don&#8217;t wait until you get that legal agreement in your inbox to begin pushing back, because it&#8217;s really annoying, and it starts to affect how they feel about you.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve even seen investors pull the term sheet. No one is bulletproof, but you really want to be as bulletproof as possible in every stage of this. That requires preparation and clear communication.<\/p>\n<p><strong>James Norman:<\/strong> As you plan out your whole fundraising process, lean into it and start to see what the market is thinking, you want to have a bottom line in terms of what you\u2019re willing to accept. At some point, you may need to capitulate, but be convinced about [that bottom line] and have a reasoning for it.<\/p>\n<p>VCs are trying to invest in leaders, so they know there&#8217;s going to be a power dynamic here. How you manage that and move things forward [impacts] how they think you&#8217;re going to do other things like hire employees and land customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Which mechanism is best to use at the outset?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Norman:<\/strong> Once you get the term sheet, the game has really begun.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding terms, you want to make sure that you&#8217;re getting an agreement that is at parity with the level you&#8217;re at with your company. You don&#8217;t want to end up with an angel investor trying to give you some Series A Preferred docs or anything of that nature.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a pre-seed or seed-stage startup, 99% of time, you should be using a SAFE (a Simple Agreement for Future Equity agreement that Y Combinator devised in 2013). It\u2019s got all the standard language that you need; no one can argue with it. [If they do], be like, &#8220;Go talk to Y Combinator about that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We recently sat down

Europe and Asia led the charge on interoperability, and by the start of the millennium the big North American telcos also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itbusiness.ca\/news\/canadian-carriers-promise-interoperable-sms\/5153\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">realized they could unlock a veritable goldmine<\/a> if they allowed consumers to message their friends on rival networks. It was a win-win for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Fast-forward to the modern smartphone age, and while email hasn&#8217;t exactly gone the way of the dodo and SMS is still stuttering along, the preeminent communication tools of today aren&#8217;t nearly as friendly with each other. Those looking to embrace independent privacy-focused messaging apps <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/29\/signal-sealed-sender-feature-messaging-security\/\">such as Signal<\/a> will hit a brick wall when they realize that <em>literally<\/em> all their pals are using WhatsApp. Or iMessage. Or Telegram. Or Viber \u2026 you get the picture.<\/p>\n<p>This trend permeates the enterprise realm, too. If your work uses Slack, good luck sending a message to your buddy across town forced to use Microsoft Teams, while those in human resources shoehorned onto Meta&#8217;s Workplace can think again about DM-ing their sales&#8217; colleagues along the corridor using Salesforce Chatter.<\/p>\n<p>This is nothing new, of course, but the issue of interoperability in the online messaging sphere has come sharply into focus in 2022. Europe is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">pushing ahead with rules<\/a> to force interoperability and portability between online platforms via the Digital Markets Act (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_Markets_Act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DMA<\/a>), while the U.S. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2021\/06\/new-access-act-good-start-heres-how-make-sure-it-delivers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has similar plans<\/a>\u00a0via the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2021\/06\/new-access-act-good-start-heres-how-make-sure-it-delivers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACCESS Act<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/27\/elon-musk-bought-twitter\/\">Elon Musk&#8217;s arrival at Twitter<\/a>\u00a0has driven awareness of alternatives such as Mastodon, the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/08\/what-is-mastodon\/\">open source Twitter alternative<\/a>\u201d that shot past <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joinmastodon\/status\/1594121627083493378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2 million users<\/a> off the back of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/11\/numerous-social-apps-see-gains-in-wake-of-twitter-chaos-new-data-shows\/\">chaos at Twitter<\/a>.

Back in July, the U.K.&#8217;s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) <a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/about-the-ico\/media-centre\/news-and-blogs\/2022\/07\/behind-the-screens-ico-calls-for-review-into-use-of-private-email-and-messaging-apps-within-government\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called for a government review<\/a> into the risks around &#8220;private correspondence channels&#8221; such as personal email accounts and WhatsApp, noting that such usage lacked &#8220;clear controls&#8221; and could lead to the loss of key information being &#8220;lost or insecurely handled.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand the value of instant communication that something like WhatsApp can bring, particularly during the pandemic where officials were forced to make quick decisions and work to meet varying demands,&#8221; U.K. information commissioner John Edwards said in a statement at the time. &#8220;However, the price of using these methods, although not against the law, must not result in a lack of transparency and inadequate data security. Public officials should be able to show their workings, for both record keeping purposes and to maintain public confidence. That is how trust in those decisions is secured and lessons are learnt for the future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the business realm, meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2022-174\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">settled with 16 Wall Street firms for $1.1 billion<\/a> over &#8220;widespread recordkeeping failures&#8221; related to their use of private messaging apps such as WhatsApp.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Finance, ultimately, depends on trust,&#8221; SEC Chair Gary Gensler said at the time. &#8220;Since the 1930s, such record keeping has been vital to preserve market integrity. As technology changes, it\u2019s even more important that registrants appropriately conduct their communications about business matters within only official channels, and they must maintain and preserve those communications.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Maintaining an accurate paper trail, and ensuring that politicians and businesses are accountable for their actions, is the name of the game &#8212; a level of control that something like the Matrix protocol promises. However, mandating that every company over a certain size &#8212; as the DMA regulation does &#8212; has to make their software interoperable with others raises a bunch of questions around privacy, security and the broader user experience.<\/p>\n<h2>The encryption elephant in the room<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2462056\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2462056\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2462056\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/GettyImages-1286351437-e1671800935781.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2462056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Concept illustration of &#8220;elephant in the room.&#8221; <strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Klyaksun\/Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As Casey Newton has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.platformer.news\/p\/three-ways-the-european-union-might?s=r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted<\/a> over at The Platformer on more than one occasion, Europe&#8217;s new interoperability regulations come with several pitfalls. Chief among them, perhaps, being the hurdles they will create for end-to-end encryption &#8212; that is, ensuring that data remains encrypted and impossible to decode while in transit.<\/p>\n<p>End-to-end encryption is a huge selling point for the big technology companies of today, one that WhatsApp hollers from the rooftops. But making this work between different platforms built by different companies is not exactly easy, and many &#8212; if not most &#8212; experts on the subject <a href=\"https:\/\/alecmuffett.com\/article\/16037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">say that it&#8217;s not possible<\/a> to enforce a truly secure, interoperable messaging infrastructure that doesn&#8217;t compromise encryption in some way.<\/p>\n<p>WhatsApp can control &#8212; and therefore promise &#8212; end-to-end encryption on its own platform. But if billions of messages are flying between WhatsApp and countless other applications run by other companies, WhatsApp can&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s happening to these messages once they leave WhatsApp.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, no two services deploy their encryption identically, a challenge that Hodgson acknowledges. &#8220;End-to-end encrypted platforms have to speak the same language from end to end,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/matrix.org\/blog\/2022\/03\/25\/interoperability-without-sacrificing-privacy-matrix-and-the-dma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post<\/a> published earlier this year to address encryption concerns, the Matrix Foundation suggested some workarounds, including having all the big gatekeepers switch to the same &#8220;decentralized end-to-end protocol&#8221; (i.e., Matrix, unsurprisingly) which, by the Foundation&#8217;s own admission, would be a large undertaking &#8212; but one &#8220;we shouldn&#8217;t rule out,&#8221; it said.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate this point, Hodgson pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/30\/element-acquires-gitter-to-get-more-developers-on-board-with-the-open-matrix-messaging-protocol\/\">Element&#8217;s 2020 acquisition of Gitter<\/a>, a developer-focused community and chat platform purchased from GitLab and used by big-name companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Within two months of closing the deal, Element <a href=\"https:\/\/element.io\/blog\/gitter-goes-native\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had introduced<\/a> native Matrix connectivity to Gitter.<\/p>\n<p>Coordinating such a transition on a Facebook, Google or Apple scale would be an entirely different proposition, of course; one that could cause all manner of knock-on chaos. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/alecmuffett.com\/article\/16037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post<\/a> earlier this year, cryptography and security expert <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlecMuffett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alec Muffett<\/a> suggested that messaging apps and social networks adhering to the same standard protocol would lead to &#8220;no practical differentiation&#8221; between different services.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine a world where Signal and Snapchat would have to interoperate &#8212; what would that look like?&#8221; Muffett asked TechCrunch rhetorically in a Q&amp;A for this story. &#8220;Specifically, which features from one needs to be presented on the other, and what are the differentiators surrounding those features? And how would conflict in functionality be reconciled?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is why the Matrix Foundation proposed other potential solutions, such as adopting a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transport_Layer_Security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TLS certificate<\/a>-style warning, where the user is alerted to the fact that their cross-service conversation is not fully protected. This is perhaps comparable to how Apple&#8217;s Messages app supports both encrypted iMessage texts and (unencrypted) SMS. But according to Muffett, it would bring unnecessary complexity to the mix.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Apart from any other reason that I could cite, there is any amount of user interface research which explains that security-pop-up-warnings are generally not understood and not heeded,&#8221; Muffett said. &#8220;There is tons of research to back this up &#8212; popup warnings are an &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anti-pattern%23Definition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">anti-pattern<\/span><\/a>.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Matrix Foundation also proposed converting communication traffic between encryption languages in a &#8220;bridge,&#8221; though this would effectively mean having to break the encryption and re-encrypt the traffic safely somewhere.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These bridges could be run client-side &#8212; for example, the Matrix iMessage bridge runs client-side on iPhone or Mac &#8212; or by using client-side open APIs to bridge between the apps locally within the phone itself,&#8221; Hodgson said. &#8220;Alternatively, they could be run server-side on hardware controlled by the user in a decentralized fashion, ensuring that the re-encryption happens in as secure an environment as possible, rather than on a vulnerable centralized server.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no escaping the fact that breaking encryption is far from ideal, irrespective of how a solution proposes to reconcile this. But perhaps more importantly, a robust solution for addressing the real encryption issues introduced by enforced interoperability doesn&#8217;t truly exist yet.<\/p>\n<p>Despite that, Hodgson has said in the past that the upsides of the new EU regulations are greater than the downsides.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;On balance, we think that the benefits of mandating open APIs outweigh the risks that someone is going to run a vulnerable large-scale bridge and undermine everyone\u2019s E2EE,&#8221; he <a href=\"https:\/\/matrix.org\/blog\/2022\/03\/25\/interoperability-without-sacrificing-privacy-matrix-and-the-dma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote<\/a> in May. &#8220;It\u2019s better to have the option to be able to get at your data in the first place than be held hostage in a walled garden.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Tip of the iceberg<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the Matrix protocol, while chiefly known for its presence in the messaging realm today, has other potential applications too. The Matrix Foundation recently announced <a href=\"https:\/\/thirdroom.io\/preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Third Room<\/a>, a decentralized and interoperable metaverse platform built on Matrix. This runs contrary to a potential future metaverse controlled by a handful of gatekeepers such as Facebook&#8217;s parent company Meta.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe title=\"ThirdRoomTechPreviewWebsite\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/skC5TYRAgKE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>For now, Element remains the flagship poster child of what a Matrix-powered world could look like. The company has secured some big-name customers already, such as Mozilla, which is using Element as a fully managed service, while Element said that it signed an $18 million four-year deal with another (unnamed) company this year. Meanwhile, it also has strategic backers, among them WordPress.com parent Automattic, which first <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/21\/automattic-pumps-4-6m-into-new-vector-to-help-grow-matrix-an-open-decentralized-comms-ecosystem\/\">invested $4.6 million<\/a> in Element back in 2020 before returning for its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/27\/element-a-messaging-app-built-on-the-decentralized-matrix-protocol-raises-30m\/\">$30 million Series B<\/a> last year.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, the ground has never been so fertile for Matrix to flourish: it&#8217;s in the right place at the right time, as the world seeks an exit route from Big Tech&#8217;s clutches backed by at least a little regulation. Twitter, too, has played more than a bit part in highlighting the downsides of centralized control, playing into the hands of all the companies banging the interoperability drum.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The situation at Twitter has been absolutely amazing in terms of building awareness of the perils of centralization, providing a pivotal moment in helping users discover that we are entering a golden age of decentralization,&#8221; Hodgson said. &#8220;Just as many users have discovered that Mastodon is an increasingly viable decentralized alternative to Twitter, we\u2019ve seen a massive halo effect of users discovering Matrix as a way to reclaim their independence over real-time communications such as messaging and VoIP &#8212; our long-term user base in particular is growing at its fastest-ever rate.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Interoperability and decentralization have been major themes in tech this year, driven in large part by mounting regulation, societal and industrial pressure and the hype trains that are crypto and web3.

It felt good to finally get that off my chest.<\/p>\n<p>The last time our team flew to Las Vegas for the event was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/ces-2020\/\">January 2020<\/a>. An auspicious date. It wouldn&#8217;t be long before the entire world went pear-shaped. It was a big show, with 117,000 in attendance, per the CTA\u2019s (Consumer Technology Association) figures. The event, which its governing body would rather you not call <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ces.tech\/media\/ces-media-kit.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Consumer Electronics Show<\/a>, has become a sprawling affair in recent decades.<\/p>\n<p>Attempting to see the entire show is a fool\u2019s errand. Back in my younger, more hopeful days, I made a point of seeing as much of it as I could, making a pretty good run at walking every official hall. That\u2019s become increasingly impossible over the years, as the show has spilled out well beyond the confines of the Las Vegas Convention Center. There\u2019s the Venetian Convention and Expo Center (RIP the Sands), countless hotel suites and various official and unofficial event spaces orbiting around the strip.<\/p>\n<p>As with countless other live event producers, the last three years have presented a kind of existential crisis for the CTA. After much foot dragging, the organization had to finally admit that an in-person <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/ces-2021\/\">CES 2021<\/a> was a terrible idea for all parties, and the pivot to a virtual event was understandably rocky. Last year, the show dovetailed with the omicron spike, and TechCrunch \u2014 among others \u2014 made the decision to sit that one out. Highly contagious new strains, coupled with holiday travel was a bridge too far.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2463063\" style=\"width: 5482px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2463063\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2463063 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/GettyImages-1237557466.jpeg\" alt=\"LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JANUARY 5: CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show opens its door to visitors on January 5, 2022 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.

The CTA pegged the event at \u201cwell over 40,000\u201d people (44,000 is the commonly accepted figure), marking a 75% drop from 2020. It\u2019s a remarkable drop, but I suppose that, given everything happening at the time, cracking 40,000 was a victory of sorts. The CTA says it\u2019s on track for 100,000 this year \u2014 seeing as how there isn\u2019t another prominent COVID-19 variant, it seems likely that, at the very least, there will be a sizable jump from 2022.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019m likely not alone in my suspicions that the CTA didn\u2019t want people getting too comfortable with 2021\u2019s virtual event. Well before COVID, there had been a longstanding question around the efficacy of in-person tech events. CES and other hardware shows have had an edge in that debate, with a focus on products that do benefit from being seen in person. That said, the last two years have demonstrated that it is, indeed, possible to cover the show reasonably well from your living room.<\/p>\n<p>We have, however, moved beyond conversation about \u201cthe new normal\u201d (honestly, when was the last time you heard that phrase uttered in earnestness?). The new normal happened when we weren\u2019t looking. The new normal is that the virus doesn\u2019t exist because we say it doesn\u2019t. Have I gotten it three times, including once from attending a trade show in Vegas? Well, yeah. Do I recognize that the act of attending a show that\u2019s billing itself as drawing in 100,000 attendees means there\u2019s a reasonable expectation that I could be staring down time number four in mid-January? Absolutely. The CES COVID <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ces.tech\/logistics\/in-person\/health-protocols.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protocols are here<\/a>. The TL;DR is that vaccination, testing and masking aren\u2019t required, but you can if you want. That\u2019s pretty much the standard everywhere at this point.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2463061\" style=\"width: 5422px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2463061\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2463061 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/GettyImages-1362969036.jpeg\" alt=\"LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JANUARY 05: Attendees pass through a hallway at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Day 1 of CES 2022, January 5, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

I mean, I\u2019m going. Other TC staff are also going. We\u2019ve pared down our presence from past years, and I imagine this is going to be the case moving forward. Given the amount of CES news that\u2019s released via press release and the fact that pretty much every press conference is streamed, the right approach to covering an event like this is be smaller and more strategic.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t simply a product of this new, endemic virus. It\u2019s a product of a shifting landscape for media in general. For all of my personal issues with the event, I do genuinely have nostalgia for those days of pure, uncut blogging, back when there was still money being dumped into format, before everything became paywalled. There\u2019s value to be had at shows like this, but for TechCrunch, at least, it\u2019s about taking the right meetings and finding the people who are working on cool things. It\u2019s harder than it sounds, having come back to 1,600 unread emails after a couple of weeks off. We made this list, and I plan to check it twice more before I hop on a plane next week.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2244147\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2244147\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2244147\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg\" alt=\"Stellantis automaker software\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg?resize=768,509 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg?resize=680,451 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg?resize=1536,1018 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg?resize=1200,795 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/stellantis-GettyImages-1233767570.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2244147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> DENIS CHARLET\/AFP \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Even before these particular sets of circumstances, CES has been through a few crises of confidence. Figures have ebbed and flowed over the years, as is the nature of these things. The smartest thing the CTA has done in the past several years is lean into the automotive side. What started as an embrace of high-tech in-car systems has expanded significantly. It\u2019s almost as if <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/07\/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech\/\">CES became a car show<\/a> when none of us were looking.<\/p>\n<p>One of the show\u2019s key plays is timing. Much to the chagrin of every person who has attempted to enjoy some time off during the holidays, it\u2019s positioned as the first show of the year in an attempt to set the cadence for the remaining 11.5 months. CES technically starts on January 5, but the press days are two days prior. This year, I\u2019m flying out on the 2nd, just to make sure we\u2019ve got our bases covered. There have been years when I\u2019ve flown in on the 1st. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m glad I stopped drinking a couple of years back.<\/p>\n<p>By positioning the show right at the beginning of the year, it\u2019s got a few months\u2019 jump on major auto shows like the ones held in Chicago, Atlanta and New York. The technology angle means we get a good look at a lot of EVs and autonomous driving systems, as well as eVTOLs and micromobility. Expect some big news, including keynotes from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/bmw\/\">BMW<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/stellantis\/\">Stellantis<\/a>. Chip makers like Qualcomm and AMD also always have a lot on the automotive front at the show.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2253447\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2253447\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2253447\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/PnD_Personal.2022-01-04-17_42_48.gif\" alt=\"Hyundai CES 2022 plug n drive\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2253447\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Hyundai<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Hyundai will have a sizable presence at the show as well, walking the line between automotive, mobility and robotics. In fact, judging by my overstuffed inbox, it\u2019s going to be a huge year for robotics, from consumer to the presence of key industrial startups in a broad range of different categories. Robotics is always a tricky one at CES. Big companies love to show off flashy robots that never go anywhere (believe it or not, the most recent Sony Aibo is a relative success story there), and there are going to be a ton of junky robotics toys. But the show is still a great place to see some legitimate breakthroughs up close. Stay tuned for next week\u2019s issue of Actuator to get a full breakdown.<\/p>\n<p>My inbox is also flooded with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/category\/cryptocurrency\/\">web3 and crypto<\/a> pitches, despite the fact that I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve written about the subject over my 6+ years at TechCrunch. To say the industry hit a rough patch in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/elon-buys-twitter\/\">2022 is like saying Elon is \u201cstill figuring it out\u201d as Twitter CEO<\/a>. The believer still believes theirs is the fix-all solution to every problem plaguing humankind. Expect that to trickle into every aspect of the show, including, somewhat ironically, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/category\/climate\/\">climate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I would love to see sustainability become a major topic at CES. Apparently there\u2019s a section in the Convention Center\u2019s North Hall. There\u2019s mostly been a smattering of climate companies at the show, but I\u2019ve certainly never been overwhelmed by them. Hopefully this is the year that starts to turn around. Ditto for accessibility. I\u2019ve heard tell of a few companies with this focus at the show, but this is something else that really needs to be at the forefront.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2372099\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2372099\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2372099 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg 2094w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/GettyImages-1010565672-e1660568744225.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2372099\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Remote control \/ smart home <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Erhui1979 \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Much has been written about Amazon\u2019s Alexa struggle of late. It\u2019s safe to say that the smart home market hasn\u2019t worked out like everyone planned.

The standard, supported by Amazon, Apple and Google, among others, really started gaining steam over the last few months. If things go according to plan, this CES will be an important moment, as the various categories of connected home <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/07\/lets-talk-ces-gadgets\/\">gadgets<\/a> are on full display.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2422781\" style=\"width: 793px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2422781\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2422781\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-10.png\" alt=\"Meta Quest Pro\" width=\"783\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-10.png 783w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-10.png?resize=150,72 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-10.png?resize=300,144 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-10.png?resize=768,369 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-10.png?resize=680,327 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-10.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2422781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Meta<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>AR\/VR \u2014 yes, I say this every year. Yes, even more than with smart homes, this one has yet to shake out the way many hoped. The recent debut of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/11\/meta-announces-the-1499-quest-pro\/\">Meta&#8217;s Quest Pro<\/a> and HTC\u2019s Vive tease will anchor the big VR news. AR will likely be even more ubiquitous. Even more than virtual reality, augmented reality feels like the Wild West right now. There are a ton of hardware makers currently vying for a spot on your face. Traditionally, CES hasn\u2019t been very gaming focused, but Sony does tend to make it a centerpiece of its own press conference and we\u2019ll likely be getting some face time with PlayStation VR.<\/p>\n<p>Wearables should get some love at the show. Oura\u2019s success has catapulted the ring form factor. We already wrote up <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/28\/movanos-new-smart-ring-is-focused-on-womens-health\/\">Movano\u2019s pre-show announcement<\/a>. Bigger names like Google, Samsung and Apple do most of their gadget announcing at their own events these days, but CES is an opportunity for some of the smaller firms to grab a bit of attention. I\u2019d anticipate an even bigger focus on health metric monitoring from names like Withings. Connected home fitness remains a key trend to watch, fueled by that initial pandemic push.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1753634\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1753634\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1753634\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg 6585w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Oura-ring-black.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1753634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Oura<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As ever, phones are mostly a nonstarter here. Mobile World Congress is where that magic happens. Otherwise, anticipate a smattering of announcements from hardware firms like Lenovo and Sony, which don\u2019t have much of a presence in the North American market. This has, however, traditionally been a big show for PCs. Dell, Asus and Lenovo all have big presences, while AMD and Nvidia could serve up some big news about the chips that power those systems.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t cover them that much, but CES is also big for TVs, in every sense of the word.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/09\/is-chatgpt-a-virus-that-has-been-released-into-the-wild\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nervous<\/a> about its uncomfortable consequences. After text-to-image tools from Stability AI and OpenAI became the talk of the town, ChatGPT&#8217;s ability to hold intelligent conversations is the new obsession in sectors across the board.<\/p>\n<p>In China, where the tech community has always watched progress in the West closely, entrepreneurs, researchers, and investors are looking for ways to make their dent in the generative AI space. Tech firms are devising tools built on open source models to attract consumer and enterprise customers. Individuals are cashing in on AI-generated content. Regulators have responded quickly to define how text, image, and video synthesis should be used. Meanwhile, U.S. tech sanctions are raising concerns about China&#8217;s ability to keep up with AI advancement.<\/p>\n<p>As generative AI takes the world by storm towards the end of 2022, let&#8217;s take a look at how this explosive technology is shaking out in China.<\/p>\n<h2>Chinese flavors<\/h2>\n<p>Thanks to viral art creation platforms like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2, generative AI is suddenly on everyone&#8217;s lips. Halfway across the world, Chinese tech giants have also captivated the public with their equivalent products, adding a twist to suit the country&#8217;s tastes and political climate.<\/p>\n<p>Baidu, which made its name in search engines and has in recent years been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/26\/baidu-night-time-driverless-robotaxis-china\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stepping up its game in autonomous driving<\/a>, operates<a href=\"https:\/\/huggingface.co\/spaces\/PaddlePaddle\/ERNIE-ViLG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ERNIE-ViLG<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2112.15283\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10-billion parameter model<\/a> trained on a data set of 145 million Chinese image-text pairs.

Below are the results from the prompt &#8220;kids eating shumai in New York Chinatown&#8221; given to Stable Diffusion, versus the same prompt in Chinese (\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5510\u4eba\u8857\u5c0f\u5b69\u5403\u70e7\u5356) for ERNIE-ViLG.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2462640\" style=\"width: 361px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2462640\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2462640 \" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png?w=614\" alt=\"\" width=\"351\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png 1094w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png?resize=135,150 135w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png?resize=271,300 271w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png?resize=768,851 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png?resize=614,680 614w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png?resize=1083,1200 1083w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.56.18-PM.png?resize=45,50 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2462640\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stable Diffusion<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2462641\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2462641\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2462641\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Screenshot-2022-12-28-at-1.55.18-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"555\" height=\"268\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2462641\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">ERNIE-ViLG<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As someone who grew up eating dim sum in China and Chinatowns, I&#8217;d say the results are a tie. Neither got the right shumai, which, in the dim sum context, is a type of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timeout.com\/hong-kong\/restaurants\/the-best-siu-mai-in-hong-kong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">succulent, shrimp and pork dumpling in a half-open yellow wrapping<\/a>. While Stable Diffusion nails the atmosphere of a Chinatown dim sum eatery, its shumai is off (but I see where the machine is going). And while ERNIE-ViLG does generate<em> a<\/em> type of shumai, it&#8217;s a variety more commonly seen in eastern China rather than the Cantonese version.<\/p>\n<p>The quick test reflects the difficulty in capturing cultural nuances when the data sets used are inherently biased &#8212; assuming Stable Diffusion would have more data on the Chinese diaspora and ERNIE-ViLG probably is trained on a greater variety of shumai images that are rarer outside China.<\/p>\n<p>Another Chinese tool that has made noise is Tencent&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/pandaily.com\/tencents-anime-ai-picture-generator-hits-global-social-platforms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Different Dimension Me<\/a>, which can turn photos of people into anime characters. The AI generator exhibits its own bias. Intended for Chinese users, it took off unexpectedly in other anime-loving regions like South America. But users soon realized the platform failed to identify black and plus-size individuals, groups that are noticeably missing in Japanese anime, leading to offensive AI-generated results.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course also clearly not having the model adjusted properly for darker-skinned folks, sigh<\/p>\n<p>Anyway Different Dimension Me is the name, but sorry they already blocked \/ limit overseas users as couldn\u2019t handle the traffic <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/cYi6rJwTaC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pic.twitter.com\/cYi6rJwTaC<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Rui Ma \u9a6c\u777f (@ruima) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ruima\/status\/1600378304745205761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December 7, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Aside from ERNIE-ViLG, another large-scale Chinese text-to-image model is <a href=\"https:\/\/huggingface.co\/IDEA-CCNL\/Taiyi-Stable-Diffusion-1B-Chinese-v0.1?text=%E5%AD%A4%E8%88%9F%E8%93%91%E7%AC%A0%E7%BF%81%EF%BC%8C%E7%8B%AC%E9%92%93%E5%AF%92%E6%B1%9F%E9%9B%AA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Taiyi<\/a>, a brainchild of IDEA, a research lab<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/23\/harry-shum-microsoft-digital-finance-china\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> led by renowned computer scientist Harry Shum<\/a>, who co-founded Microsoft\u2019s largest research branch outside the U.S., Microsoft Research Asia.

That means the center probably enjoys more research freedom without the pressure to drive commercial success. Based in the tech hub of Shenzhen and supported by one of China&#8217;s wealthiest cities, it&#8217;s an up-and-coming outfit worth watching.<\/p>\n<h2>Rules of AI<\/h2>\n<p>China&#8217;s generative AI tools aren&#8217;t just characterized by the domestic data they learn from; they are also shaped by local laws. As MIT Technology Review <a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2022\/09\/14\/1059481\/baidu-chinese-image-ai-tiananmen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out<\/a>, Baidu&#8217;s text-to-image model filters out politically sensitive keywords. That&#8217;s expected, given censorship has long been a universal practice on the Chinese internet.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more significant to the future of the fledgling field is the new set of regulatory measures targeting what the government dubs &#8220;deep synthesis tech&#8221;, which denotes &#8220;technology that uses deep learning, virtual reality, and other synthesis algorithms to generate text, images, audio, video, and virtual scenes.&#8221;As with other types of internet services in China, from games to social media, users are asked to verify their names before using generative AI apps. The fact that prompts can be traced to one&#8217;s real identity inevitably has a restrictive impact on user behavior.<\/p>\n<p>But on the bright side, these rules could lead to more responsible use of generative AI, which is already being abused elsewhere to<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/26\/what-to-expect-from-ai-in-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> churn out NSFW and sexist content<\/a>. The Chinese regulation, for example, explicitly bans people from generating and spreading AI-created fake news. How that will be implemented, though, lies with the service providers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"isPKgVkHwo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/13\/chinas-generative-ai-rules-set-boundaries-and-punishments-for-misuse\/\">China&#8217;s generative AI rules set boundaries and punishments for misuse<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;China&#8217;s generative AI rules set boundaries and punishments for misuse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/13\/chinas-generative-ai-rules-set-boundaries-and-punishments-for-misuse\/embed\/#?secret=EUBMqtSoqI#?secret=isPKgVkHwo\" data-secret=\"isPKgVkHwo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that China is at the forefront of trying to regulate [generative AI] as a country,&#8221; said Yoav Shoham, founder of AI21 Labs, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/12\/openai-rival-ai21-labs-raises-64m-to-ramp-up-its-ai-powered-language-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an Israel-based OpenAI rival<\/a>, in an interview. &#8220;There are various companies that are putting limits to AI&#8230; Every country I know of has efforts to regulate AI or to somehow make sure that the legal system, or the social system, is keeping up with the technology, specifically about regulating the automatic generation of content.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s no consensus as to how the fast-changing field should be governed, yet. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s an area we&#8217;re all learning together,&#8221; Shoham admitted. &#8220;It has to be a collaborative effort. It has to involve technologists who actually understand the technology and what it does and what it doesn&#8217;t do, the public sector, social scientists, and people who are impacted by the technology as well as the government, including the sort of commercial and legal aspect of the regulation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Monetizing AI<\/h2>\n<p>As artists fret over being replaced by powerful AI, many in China are leveraging machine learning algorithms to make money in a plethora of ways. They aren&#8217;t from the most tech-savvy crowd. Rather, they are opportunists or stay-home mums looking for an extra source of income. They realize that by improving their prompts, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.163.com\/dy\/article\/HGOB9LPI05539POX.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they can trick AI into making creative emojis or stunning wallpapers<\/a>, which they can post on social media to drive ad revenues or directly charge for downloads. The really skilled ones are also selling their prompts to others who want to join the money-making game &#8212; or even train them for a fee.<\/p>\n<p>Others in China are using AI in their formal jobs like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/10\/21\/technology\/ai-generated-art-jobs-dall-e-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the rest of the world<\/a>. Light fiction writers, for instance, can cheaply churn out illustrations for their works, a genre that is shorter than novels and often features illustrations. An intriguing use case that can potentially disrupt realms of manufacturing is using AI to design T-shirts, press-on nails, and prints for other consumer goods. By generating large batches of prototypes quickly, manufacturers save on design costs and shorten their production cycle.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s too early to know how differently generative AI is developing in China and the West. But entrepreneurs have made decisions based on their early observation. A few founders told me that businesses and professionals are generally happy to pay for AI because they see a direct return on investment, so startups are eager to carve out industry use cases. One clever application came from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/01\/surreal-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sequoia China-backed Surreal<\/a> (later <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/08\/movio-marketing-videos-generative-ai\/\">renamed to Movio<\/a>) and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/17\/zmo-ai-generate-human-8-million\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hillhouse-backed ZMO.ai<\/a>, which discovered during the pandemic that e-commerce sellers were struggling to find foreign models as China kept its borders shut. The solution? The two companies worked on algorithms that generated fashion models of all shapes, colors, and races.<\/p>\n<p>But some entrepreneurs don&#8217;t believe their AI-powered SaaS will see the type of skyrocketing valuation and meteoric growth their Western counterparts, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/ai-content-platform-jasper-raises-125m-at-a-1-7b-valuation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jasper<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/17\/stability-ai-the-startup-behind-stable-diffusion-raises-101m\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stability AI<\/a>, are enjoying. Over the years, numerous Chinese startups have told me they have the same concern: China&#8217;s enterprise customers are generally less willing to pay for SaaS than those in developed economies, which is why <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/03\/pacdora-packaging-design-platform-canva-figma\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many of them start expanding overseas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Competition in China&#8217;s SaaS space is also dog-eat-dog. &#8220;In the U.S., you can do fairly well by building product-led software, which doesn&#8217;t rely on human services to acquire or retain users. But in China, even if you have a great product, your rival could steal your source code overnight and hire dozens of customer support staff, which don&#8217;t cost that much, to outrace you,&#8221; said a founder of a Chinese generative AI startup, requesting anonymity.<\/p>\n<p>Shi Yi, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myflashcloud.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sales intelligence startup FlashCloud<\/a>, agreed that Chinese companies often prioritize short-term returns over long-term innovation. &#8220;In regard to talent development, Chinese tech firms tend to be more focused on getting skilled at applications and generating quick money,&#8221; he said. One Shanghai-based investor, who declined to be named, said he was &#8220;a bit disappointed that major breakthroughs in generative AI this year are all happening outside China.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"w61tzbqA6G\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/14\/chinas-startups-give-up-mainland-dreams\/\">Wrapped in red tape, China\u2019s startups give up their mainland dreams<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Wrapped in red tape, China\u2019s startups give up their mainland dreams&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/14\/chinas-startups-give-up-mainland-dreams\/embed\/#?secret=dQASSClr7r#?secret=w61tzbqA6G\" data-secret=\"w61tzbqA6G\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Roadblocks ahead<\/h2>\n<p>Even when Chinese tech firms want to invest in training large neural networks, they might lack the best tools. In September, the U.S. government <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/02\/china-us-nvidia-export-ban\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slapped China with export controls on high-end AI chips<\/a>. While many Chinese AI startups are focused on the application front and don&#8217;t need high-performance semiconductors that handle seas of data, for those doing basic research, using less powerful chips means computing will take longer and cost more, said an enterprise software investor at a top Chinese VC firm, requesting anonymity. The good news is, he argued, such sanctions are pushing China to invest in advanced technologies over the long run.<\/p>\n<p>As a company that bills itself as a leader in China&#8217;s AI field, Baidu believes the impact of U.S. chip sanction on its AI business is &#8220;limited&#8221; both in the short and longer term, said the firm&#8217;s executive vice president and head of AI Cloud Group, Dou Shen, on its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2022\/11\/22\/baidu-bidu-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Q3 earnings call<\/a>. That&#8217;s because &#8220;a large portion&#8221; of Baidu&#8217;s AI cloud business &#8220;does not rely too much on the highly advanced chips.&#8221; And in cases where it does need high-end chips, it has &#8220;already stocked enough in hand, actually, to support our business in the near term.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What about the future? &#8220;When we look at it at a mid- to a longer-term, we actually have our own developed AI chip, so named <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-05-18\/baidu-s-chip-affiliate-eyes-fundraise-at-2-5-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kunlun<\/a>,&#8221; the executive said confidently. &#8220;By using our Kunlun chips [Inaudible] in large language models, the efficiency to perform text and image recognition tasks on our AI platform has been improved by 40% and the total cost has been reduced by 20% to 30%.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Time will tell if Kunlun and other indigenous AI chips will give China an edge in the generative AI race.<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The gigantic technological leap that machine learning models have shown in the last few months is getting everyone excited about the future of AI &#8212; but also nervous about its uncomfortable consequences.
