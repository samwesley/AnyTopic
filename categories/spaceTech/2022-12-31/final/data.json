The Carbon Mapper project will use data from the NASA mission EMIT to survey waste sites for emissions of greenhouse gas. A NASA science instrument in orbit will form the backbone of a new initiative to survey methane emissions from landfills in a new nonprofit project to track the greenhouse gas. The new project, led by the nonprofit group Carbon Mapper,  will use data collected from the International Space Station by NASA's EMIT experiment (its name is short for Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation) and other NASA science instruments to track methane, which according to NASA is the source of around a quarter to a third of human-driven global warming. By establishing a baseline assessment of waste sites across the planet, and determining which sites emit methane at high rates, the initiative could help decision-makers reduce the concentration of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere thus limiting climate change. Related: 10 signs of climate change satellites see from space \"Currently, there is limited actionable information about methane emissions from the global waste sector,\" Carbon Mapper CEO Riley Duren said in a NASA statement. \"A comprehensive understanding of high-emission point sources from waste sites is a critical step to mitigating them.\" In comparison to carbon dioxide, methane is pound for pound 80 times more potent in trapping heat in the atmosphere. Unlike carbon dioxide, however, methane doesn't last as long in Earth's atmosphere and has a lifetime of decades rather than centuries. This means that significantly reducing methane emissions could have an immediate effect in slowing atmospheric warming.  As the waste sector is estimated to contribute around 20% of human-caused methane emissions it is one of the primary focuses of the mission to reduce this greenhouse gas.  \"New technological capabilities that are making these emissions visible \u200a\u2014\u200a and therefore actionable \u200a\u2014 \u200ahave the potential to change the game, elevating our collective understanding of near-term opportunities in this often overlooked sector,\" Duren said. \u2014 10 devastating signs of climate change satellites can see from space \u2014 Climate 'points of no return' may be much closer than we thought \u2014 Satellites discover huge amounts of undeclared methane emissions The Carbon Mapper project will conduct an initial remote-sensing survey of over 1,000 managed landfills across the United States, Canada, and other sites in Latin America, Africa, and Asia in 2023. This data will be collected using aircraft-based sensors such as the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG (opens in new tab)) and Arizona State University's Global Airborne Observatory both developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California.  The project will also use methane data from EMIT which was installed at the International Space Station in July with the purpose of the studying the mineral content of the planet's major dust-producing regions.  In October 2022, EMIT demonstrated its capability in methane detection, spotting methane plumes from over 50 so-called \"super-emitters\" in Central Asia, the Middle East and the Southwestern United States. \"NASA JPL has a decade-long track record of using airborne imaging spectrometers to make high-quality observations of methane point-source emissions,\" Robert Green, the EMIT principal investigator at JPL, said in the NASA statement. \"With EMIT we have employed the same technology in a spaceborne instrument, enabling us to collect information on localized methane sources from orbit.\" Following its first year, the Carbon Mapper team will begin a broader survey of around 10,000 landfill sites across the globe using satellites equipped with imaging spectrometer technology developed at JPL.

In particular, the solar energy industry has seen an extremely rapid development in the past decade. In 2020 alone, over 127 GW of new photovoltaic (PV) power generation capacity was installed, leading to the total global PV power generation capacity of 707.5 GW (702.9 GW on-grid and 4.584 MW of off-grid)1 at the end of 2020. This means more than one-fifth of renewable energy in the world today is generated by PV technology. The development of the PV industry in the 20th Century had mainly been fuelled by technological advances and the needs of a few niche markets, such as space applications, which required an autonomous and lightweight power source. The material and fabrication costs of manufacturing solar cells were very high in the 20th Century; however, this was not an immediate concern at the time because their main applications, space projects, were not considered profitable anyway.  On the other hand, the recent \u2018solar boom\u2019 has been driven by technical advances in PV technology which have allowed for not only the optimisation in gathering and producing energy, but also a reduction of its associated costs. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s (IRENA) recent report2, the global weighted-average total installed cost of utility scale solar PV fell from US$4731/kW to US$883/kW between 2010 and 2020. Over the same period, the levelised cost of electricity from utility scale solar PV also fell by 85% between 2010 and 2020, recording US$0.057/kWh. This figure is comparable to that of coal-fired power generation (which is the cheapest fossil-fuel competitor) available in 2020 (US$0.05/kWh). Given the cost savings over fossil fuels projected in the years to come, alongside international efforts to respond to climate change, the rapid growth of global solar PV capacity is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  However, whilst this should be welcome news in view of the energy transition, the already large and increasing number of solar panel installations inevitably leads to a problem: What happens to solar panels when they reach end-of-life (EOL)? So far, EOL disposal of solar panels has not caused too many concerns: solar panels only started being widely deployed in the early 2000s, and the industry standard lifespan of solar panels is approximately 25 \u2013 30 years (although many believe that the actual lifespan may be as long as 35 \u2013 40 years). Given that most of the solar panels in the world were installed in the past decade (2011 \u2013 2020), there will likely be a sudden increase in the number of dead solar panels starting from mid-2030s. To give a rough idea, PV panels installed in the past decade provide 640 225 MW total capacity, which is equitant to over 2 billion 300 W solar panels.  Some may think the mid-2030s timeline is still too early to worry about EOL management of solar panels. However, there are many good reasons why this issue should start being taken more seriously now. The good news is that many governments have already started introducing frameworks for recycling, reusing and, if neither is possible, disposing of dead solar panels. For example, in the UK and many European countries, collection, recycling, and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods, such as solar panels, are set according to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive). Still, it is questionable whether the capacity of the existing recycling facilities dedicated to electrical and electronic waste would be able to cope with the ever-increasing volume of solar panel waste. Moreover, conventional recycling processes for general electrical and electronic waste may not be able to deliver the best material recovery rate for solar panel waste. With the rise of high-efficiency PV cells made of novel semiconductor or organic materials, it is also questionable whether conventional electronic waste recycling and disposal processes, which are designed mainly with silicon electronics in mind, would be able to safely handle novel PV materials, some of which are known to be toxic to human health. But why is there a need to worry about how to reuse and recycle EOL solar panels and their parts? Although the most obvious answer to this question would be to minimise the environmental impact that such large volumes of solar panel waste can have on the planet, this is not just an environmental issue. Solar panels are made of many components, including PV cells (electricity-producing devices), electrical connections, and support frame, all of which contain materials that can be reused or extracted for further use.

NASA has released a stunning series of images that celebrate 2022 aboard the International Space Station.  In 2022 the International Space Station (ISS) marked its 24th year orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 400 kilometers (250 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface. The images, which can be seen as a montage on NASA Johnson's YouTube channel (opens in new tab), show that after nearly a decade and a half the station\u2019s mission to further science is still going strong.  The pictures record some of the ISS achievements during 2022 which include the deployment of tiny satellites caled cubesats over Earth and the testing of fluid dynamics in space.  Related: Amazing spacewalks outside the International Space Station in photos Yet more images demonstrate what life is like on a space station hundreds of miles above the Earth, the wonder of looking back to our planet from space, and the thrill and danger of taking a walk in space separated from the dangerous environment by little more than a sheet of plastic. The first image in the video shows astronaut Bob Hines working with the GRASP experiment on the station. GRASP consists of a chair and worktable equipped with sensors to measure an astronaut's movement, position, grip force, and finger humidity as they perform tasks.   Hines is wearing virtual reality glasses that map the link between what he can feel and observe through their other senses such as his eyes, muscles, and vestibular (balance) organs.  The aim of GRASP is to improve understanding of the body\u2019s sensory feedback system, so not only could the findings be useful in space but they could also help scientists here on Earth to explore new treatments for neurological diseases.  The second image in the video shows Hines alongside astronaut Jessica Watkins, who made history in April 2022 by becoming the first Black woman to join a months-long ISS mission, examining the XROOTS experiment. This uses the ISS's Veggie facility to test the use of hydroponic and aeroponic techniques rather than soil to grow plants.  In the third image of the video, the crew of the ISS gathers in the U.S.-built Destiny module during a conference with Mission Control on Earth. The image may look like any other team gathering at first glimpse if not for European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti defying gravity by comfortably hanging from the ceiling.   In the next  image, astronauts Thomas Marshburn and Mark Vande Hei gaze out of the ISS cupola windows as Earth passes below them. More than just exemplifying the wonder of space habitation crew observations of our planet help us understand how it is changing over time.   An example of these Earth observations is seen in an ISS image of the Carrizozo Malpa\u00eds, a long strip of basalt located in the desert of New Mexico is seen in stunning detail. The geological feature was created by a decades-long eruption and was captured by the ISS crew using handheld cameras.  In another image featured in the video, Earth is also prominent as the ISS passing over the Atlantic Ocean observes the launch of a trio of cubesats from a small satellite deployer.  The view of the ISS into space in 2022 also allowed the moment astronauts Josh Cassada and Frank Rubio ventured outside the relative safety of the station to install the roll-out solar array, or iROSA, to its starboard truss structure. In total 6 iROSAs will be attached to the ISS granting the station a 30% power increase.   \u2014 The most memorable spacewalks in history \u2014 The International Space Station: Facts, history and tracking \u2014 In photos: The amazing spacewalks of Expedition 61 The last image featured in the NASA video shows the U.S. module Destiny again, but this time unoccupied. With its lights out Destiny is awash with green ambient light. In 2022 Destiny, which is home to a variety of life and physical sciences, technology demonstrations as well as educational events, was bolstered by the Solid Fuel Ignition and Extinction (SOFIE) hardware. This will help Destiny conduct new combustion studies in 2023 as the space station enters in the year of its silver anniversary and 25 years of conducting space science.

Related: Amazing spacewalks outside the International Space Station in photosYet more images demonstrate what life is like on a space station hundreds of miles above the Earth, the wonder of looking back to our planet from space, and the thrill and danger of taking a walk in space separated from the dangerous environment by little more than a sheet of plastic.The first image in the video shows astronaut Bob Hines working with the GRASP experiment on the station. GRASP consists of a chair and worktable equipped with sensors to measure an astronaut's movement, position, grip force, and finger humidity as they perform tasks. NASA astronaut Bob Hines participates in the GRASP investigation to help researchers better understand if and how gravity acts as a reference for the control of reach-to-grasp movement in 2022. (Image credit: NASA)Hines is wearing virtual reality glasses that map the link between what he can feel and observe through their other senses such as his eyes, muscles, and vestibular (balance) organs. The aim of GRASP is to improve understanding of the body\u2019s sensory feedback system, so not only could the findings be useful in space but they could also help scientists here on Earth to explore new treatments for neurological diseases.NASA astronauts Jessica Watkins and Bob Hines work on XROOTS, which uses the space station\u2019s Veggie facility to test hydroponic and aeroponic techniques to grow plants rather than using traditional soil in 2022. (Image credit: NASA)The second image in the video shows Hines alongside astronaut Jessica Watkins, who made history in April 2022 by becoming the first Black woman to join a months-long ISS mission, examining the XROOTS experiment. This uses the ISS's Veggie facility to test the use of hydroponic and aeroponic techniques rather than soil to grow plants.Six members of the space station crew, with European astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti upside down, participate in an evening conference with mission controllers on the ground to review experiment schedules and receive updates.

          "The gigantic technological leap that machine learning models have shown in the last few months is getting everyone excited about the future of AI \u2014 but also nervous about its uncomfortable consequences. After text-to-image tools from Stability AI and OpenAI became the talk of the town, ChatGPT\u2019s ability to hold intelligent conversations is the new obsession in sectors across the board. In China, where the tech community has always watched progress in the West closely, entrepreneurs, researchers, and investors are looking for ways to make their dent in the generative AI space. Tech firms are devising tools built on open source models to attract consumer and enterprise customers. Individuals are cashing in on AI-generated content. Regulators have responded quickly to define how text, image, and video synthesis should be used. Meanwhile, U.S. tech sanctions are raising concerns about China\u2019s ability to keep up with AI advancement. As generative AI takes the world by storm towards the end of 2022, let\u2019s take a look at how this explosive technology is shaking out in China. Thanks to viral art creation platforms like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2, generative AI is suddenly on everyone\u2019s lips. Halfway across the world, Chinese tech giants have also captivated the public with their equivalent products, adding a twist to suit the country\u2019s tastes and political climate. Baidu, which made its name in search engines and has in recent years been stepping up its game in autonomous driving, operates ERNIE-ViLG, a 10-billion parameter model trained on a data set of 145 million Chinese image-text pairs. How does it fair against its American counterpart? Below are the results from the prompt \u201ckids eating shumai in New York Chinatown\u201d given to Stable Diffusion, versus the same prompt in Chinese (\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5510\u4eba\u8857\u5c0f\u5b69\u5403\u70e7\u5356) for ERNIE-ViLG. Stable Diffusion Stable Diffusion ERNIE-ViLG ERNIE-ViLG As someone who grew up eating dim sum in China and Chinatowns, I\u2019d say the results are a tie. Neither got the right shumai, which, in the dim sum context, is a type of succulent, shrimp and pork dumpling in a half-open yellow wrapping. While Stable Diffusion nails the atmosphere of a Chinatown dim sum eatery, its shumai is off (but I see where the machine is going). And while ERNIE-ViLG does generate a type of shumai, it\u2019s a variety more commonly seen in eastern China rather than the Cantonese version. The quick test reflects the difficulty in capturing cultural nuances when the data sets used are inherently biased \u2014 assuming Stable Diffusion would have more data on the Chinese diaspora and ERNIE-ViLG probably is trained on a greater variety of shumai images that are rarer outside China. Another Chinese tool that has made noise is Tencent\u2019s Different Dimension Me, which can turn photos of people into anime characters. The AI generator exhibits its own bias. Intended for Chinese users, it took off unexpectedly in other anime-loving regions like South America. But users soon realized the platform failed to identify black and plus-size individuals, groups that are noticeably missing in Japanese anime, leading to offensive AI-generated results. Of course also clearly not having the model adjusted properly for darker-skinned folks, sigh Anyway Different Dimension Me is the name, but sorry they already blocked / limit overseas users as couldn\u2019t handle the traffic pic.twitter.com/cYi6rJwTaC \u2014 Rui Ma \u9a6c\u777f (@ruima) December 7, 2022  Aside from ERNIE-ViLG, another large-scale Chinese text-to-image model is Taiyi, a brainchild of IDEA, a research lab led by renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, who co-founded Microsoft\u2019s largest research branch outside the U.S., Microsoft Research Asia. The open source AI model is trained on 20 million filtered Chinese image-text pairs and has one billion parameters. Unlike Baidu and other profit-driven tech firms, IDEA is one of a handful of institutions backed by local governments in recent years to work on cutting-edge technologies. That means the center probably enjoys more research freedom without the pressure to drive commercial success. Based in the tech hub of Shenzhen and supported by one of China\u2019s wealthiest cities, it\u2019s an up-and-coming outfit worth watching. China\u2019s generative AI tools aren\u2019t just characterized by the domestic data they learn from; they are also shaped by local laws. As MIT Technology Review pointed out, Baidu\u2019s text-to-image model filters out politically sensitive keywords. That\u2019s expected, given censorship has long been a universal practice on the Chinese internet. What\u2019s more significant to the future of the fledgling field is the new set of regulatory measures targeting what the government dubs \u201cdeep synthesis tech\u201d, which denotes \u201ctechnology that uses deep learning, virtual reality, and other synthesis algorithms to generate text, images, audio, video, and virtual scenes.\u201dAs with other types of internet services in China, from games to social media, users are asked to verify their names before using generative AI apps. The fact that prompts can be traced to one\u2019s real identity inevitably has a restrictive impact on user behavior. But on the bright side, these rules could lead to more responsible use of generative AI, which is already being abused elsewhere to churn out NSFW and sexist content. The Chinese regulation, for example, explicitly bans people from generating and spreading AI-created fake news. How that will be implemented, though, lies with the service providers. China\u2019s generative AI rules set boundaries and punishments for misuse  \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that China is at the forefront of trying to regulate [generative AI] as a country,\u201d said Yoav Shoham, founder of AI21 Labs, an Israel-based OpenAI rival, in an interview. \u201cThere are various companies that are putting limits to AI\u2026 Every country I know of has efforts to regulate AI or to somehow make sure that the legal system, or the social system, is keeping up with the technology, specifically about regulating the automatic generation of content.\u201d But there\u2019s no consensus as to how the fast-changing field should be governed, yet. \u201cI think it\u2019s an area we\u2019re all learning together,\u201d Shoham admitted. \u201cIt has to be a collaborative effort. It has to involve technologists who actually understand the technology and what it does and what it doesn\u2019t do, the public sector, social scientists, and people who are impacted by the technology as well as the government, including the sort of commercial and legal aspect of the regulation.\u201d As artists fret over being replaced by powerful AI, many in China are leveraging machine learning algorithms to make money in a plethora of ways. They aren\u2019t from the most tech-savvy crowd. Rather, they are opportunists or stay-home mums looking for an extra source of income. They realize that by improving their prompts, they can trick AI into making creative emojis or stunning wallpapers, which they can post on social media to drive ad revenues or directly charge for downloads. The really skilled ones are also selling their prompts to others who want to join the money-making game \u2014 or even train them for a fee. Others in China are using AI in their formal jobs like the rest of the world. Light fiction writers, for instance, can cheaply churn out illustrations for their works, a genre that is shorter than novels and often features illustrations. An intriguing use case that can potentially disrupt realms of manufacturing is using AI to design T-shirts, press-on nails, and prints for other consumer goods. By generating large batches of prototypes quickly, manufacturers save on design costs and shorten their production cycle. It\u2019s too early to know how differently generative AI is developing in China and the West. But entrepreneurs have made decisions based on their early observation. A few founders told me that businesses and professionals are generally happy to pay for AI because they see a direct return on investment, so startups are eager to carve out industry use cases. One clever application came from Sequoia China-backed Surreal (later renamed to Movio) and Hillhouse-backed ZMO.ai, which discovered during the pandemic that e-commerce sellers were struggling to find foreign models as China kept its borders shut. The solution? The two companies worked on algorithms that generated fashion models of all shapes, colors, and races. But some entrepreneurs don\u2019t believe their AI-powered SaaS will see the type of skyrocketing valuation and meteoric growth their Western counterparts, like Jasper and Stability AI, are enjoying. Over the years, numerous Chinese startups have told me they have the same concern: China\u2019s enterprise customers are generally less willing to pay for SaaS than those in developed economies, which is why many of them start expanding overseas. Competition in China\u2019s SaaS space is also dog-eat-dog. \u201cIn the U.S., you can do fairly well by building product-led software, which doesn\u2019t rely on human services to acquire or retain users. But in China, even if you have a great product, your rival could steal your source code overnight and hire dozens of customer support staff, which don\u2019t cost that much, to outrace you,\u201d said a founder of a Chinese generative AI startup, requesting anonymity. Shi Yi, founder and CEO of sales intelligence startup FlashCloud, agreed that Chinese companies often prioritize short-term returns over long-term innovation. \u201cIn regard to talent development, Chinese tech firms tend to be more focused on getting skilled at applications and generating quick money,\u201d he said. One Shanghai-based investor, who declined to be named, said he was \u201ca bit disappointed that major breakthroughs in generative AI this year are all happening outside China.\u201d Wrapped in red tape, China\u2019s startups give up their mainland dreams  Even when Chinese tech firms want to invest in training large neural networks, they might lack the best tools. In September, the U.S. government slapped China with export controls on high-end AI chips. While many Chinese AI startups are focused on the application front and don\u2019t need high-performance semiconductors that handle seas of data, for those doing basic research, using less powerful chips means computing will take longer and cost more, said an enterprise software investor at a top Chinese VC firm, requesting anonymity. The good news is, he argued, such sanctions are pushing China to invest in advanced technologies over the long run. As a company that bills itself as a leader in China\u2019s AI field, Baidu believes the impact of U.S. chip sanction on its AI business is \u201climited\u201d both in the short and longer term, said the firm\u2019s executive vice president and head of AI Cloud Group, Dou Shen, on its Q3 earnings call. That\u2019s because \u201ca large portion\u201d of Baidu\u2019s AI cloud business \u201cdoes not rely too much on the highly advanced chips.\u201d And in cases where it does need high-end chips, it has \u201calready stocked enough in hand, actually, to support our business in the near term.\u201d What about the future? \u201cWhen we look at it at a mid- to a longer-term, we actually have our own developed AI chip, so named Kunlun,\u201d the executive said confidently. \u201cBy using our Kunlun chips [Inaudible] in large language models, the efficiency to perform text and image recognition tasks on our AI platform has been improved by 40% and the total cost has been reduced by 20% to 30%.\u201d Time will tell if Kunlun and other indigenous AI chips will give China an edge in the generative AI race.

The UK Space Agency\u2019s Head of Space Exploration, Libby Jackson, and Professor Terry Moore, Emeritus Professor of the University of Nottingham, both received an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the honours, which recognise the achievements and service of extraordinary people across the UK. Libby, who joined the UK Space Agency in 2014, was honoured for her services to the space sector, having worked to raise the profile of women in space and help encourage young people to consider studying and working in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Professor Terry Moore has made a major and long-standing contribution to the field of space-based navigation that has significantly benefited the UK. Dr Paul Bate, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, said: I would like to congratulate Libby and Terry on behalf of everyone at the UK Space Agency, their recognition in the New Year Honours is fantastic news and thoroughly deserved. From working with Libby, I know how dedicated she is to sharing her passion for human spaceflight, particularly with the next generation. She is an inspiration who strives to champion the sector and ensure young people are aware of the wide variety of jobs available in space. Terry\u2019s contribution to the field of space-based navigation has increased the UK\u2019s reputation internationally in this field, deepened our national capability and supported the development of a successful industrial cluster in the Midlands. After graduating with a BSc in physics from Imperial College and a master\u2019s degree in astronautics and space engineering from Cranfield University, Libby worked for Airbus Defence and Space in satellite operations. Libby then worked in Mission Control as a flight controller and then Flight Director for the Columbus module, Europe\u2019s laboratory on the International Space Station. Today Libby is one of Britain\u2019s leading experts in human spaceflight and previously managed the hugely successful education programme for Tim Peake\u2019s mission to the International Space Station. Over two million students took part in the outreach programme, with one in three UK schools participating. Libby is a regular spokesperson for the UK Space Agency, championing STEM, sharing stories of human spaceflight and encouraging young people to follow their passions in life. She regularly volunteers at events, such as Swindon\u2019s Festival of Tomorrow and Bluedot Festival, providing interactive talks and activities to inspire the public. Her first book, A Galaxy of Her Own: Amazing Stories of Women in Space, was published in 2017, with the aim of encouraging young girls into STEM, and her second, Space Explorers: 25 Extraordinary Stories of Space Exploration and Adventure, was published in 2020. Libby said: It\u2019s a wonderful honour to be recognised for my work in this way, particularly by my peers across the UK Space Agency and government. Nothing happens in isolation and it\u2019s only because I have worked with such an outstanding and talented set of people through the years that this has happened. I would like to thank them and pay tribute to their work. I have got here by doing what I enjoy, and I would always encourage young people to follow their passion. I hope this shines a light on the space sector and the amazing opportunities available to people. Terry has 40 years of research experience in position and navigation and is a consultant and adviser to US, European and UK government organisations and industry. He became the UK\u2019s first ever Chair of Satellite Navigation at the University of Nottingham in 2001. Terry represents the UK internationally on space-based navigation matters, and is a member of the US National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Advisory Committee which advises the US Government on GPS. This is a significant recognition of UK strength in this field. Terry is also a member of the European Space Agency\u2019s Galileo Science Advisory Committee. In 2021, he was awarded the International Association of Institutes of Navigation\u2019s John Harrison Award for Outstanding Contributions to Navigation. This is the premier global award in the field of navigation and Terry is its first ever British winner. He was the founding Director of GRACE (a research and applications centre of excellence), jointly funded by the University of Nottingham and East Midlands Development Agency. Nottingham is now a centre for space-based navigation and timing and boasts Europe\u2019s leading space-based navigation and timing consultancy. Terry is a Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors and a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He has supervised over 40 PhD students, many of whom are now leaders in the field. He has been President of the Royal Institute of Navigation \u2013 a world renowned society for navigation with members in over 50 countries and is Chair of the European Group of Institutes of Navigation and he is a Fellow and Member of Council of the American Institute of Navigation. Terry said: It\u2019s a great honour to be recognised and nominated for this award. I am particularly proud of the significant impact that satellite navigation systems have on everyone\u2019s daily lives, even without them knowing, and I hope that this award helps us to continue to stress the vital importance of the technology we now take for granted. \n      Sharing will open the page in a new tab\n     Don\u2019t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.

          "If you know me, you know I'm a big fan of technology. Not a day goes by that I'm not using some sort of gadget.  I live on my iPhone. The lights in my house are controlled by an app, as are the security cameras throughout. My job has me sitting in front of a computer most of the day, and I haven't read a paper book in years, instead preferring my iPad or Kindle.  But while I'm a major user of technology, I also often find myself not truly appreciating what we have to offer.  It wasn't that terribly long ago that I didn't even have a cell phone, yet now I'm annoyed when I don't have high-speed internet access on my iPhone. In 2007, my future wife and I attended a NASCAR race at Michigan International Speedway. We camped across the street from the track, and the race rained out. I remember using my flip phone at the time to access some semblance of the mobile internet to find out what the plans were for the race the next day. It would take about a half hour to load a web page, and the radios required to do so would drain my battery in less than an hour. But I was OK with that, because I could get the information I needed, eventually.  Now I'm annoyed if I can't stream 4K video in the middle of nowhere.  It was comedian Louis C.K. who said, \"Everything is amazing right now and nobody's happy.\" He said now people are annoyed when their phone doesn't give them the information instantly.  \"Give it a second,\" he says. \"It's going to space. Can you give it a second to get back from space?\" No matter what you think of Louis C.K., he's not wrong. I remember when I was a kid, I dreamed of buying one of those little handheld TVs. They were awful, really. They were expensive, and they had like a little 3-inch black and white screen. There was a 37-foot antenna you had to have sticking up to watch anything, and even then the only signal you could probably pick up was PBS. Plus you'd have to plug it in, because the eight D-cell batteries would only last like 60 seconds until they died. And yet I dreamed of being able to watch TV in my hand.  Now I'm a YouTube TV subscriber, and I literally can do that on my phone. But not just PBS, I can get just about any cable channel that exists. When a movie comes out, I can watch it instantly, without the need to go to a store. When a new music album releases, I don't have to go to Walmart and hope it's not sold out \u2014 I don't even have to buy it. Instead I just open up Apple Music or Spotify and I can play it instantly.  I remember going to multiple bookstores to find the latest new release that I wanted to read, but now I go on my Kindle app and buy it ahead of time and it downloads to my device automatically the second it is released.  It really is amazing what we can do nowadays.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg, of course. I remember how real I thought video games looked when the Nintendo 64 came out, but now video games actually look real. And you can play them with another person on the other side of the country with virtually no lag, just like they're sitting in the room with you.  We have electric cars, some that can even drive themselves. It's just amazing.  And yet, in the words of Louis C.K., \"nobody's happy.\" So next time you're in an area with a slow internet connection on your cell phone (and we all know there are plenty of places like that here in the Thumb), instead of getting annoyed, consider the fact that it's going to space, and take a moment and appreciate the technology that we have in our hands today.

The veteran B1060 core\u2014making her 15th flight\u2014will deliver 114 small \u201crideshare\u201d cargoes into orbit on the Transporter-6 mission. As its nomenclature implies, this will be SpaceX\u2019s sixth haul of multi-payload Transporter \u201cstacks\u201d. Five earlier missions in January and June of 2021, and more recently in January, April and May of last year, lifted some 435 payloads\u2014including miniaturized CubeSats and PocketQubes\u2014covering disciplines from Earth observation to technology, communications to navigation, remote sensing to signals intelligence and education to amateur radio, on behalf of no fewer than 32 sovereign nations. Notably, Transporter-1\u2019s haul of 143 small satellites\u2014totaling 11,000 pounds (5,000 kilograms)\u2014still stands as the greatest number of discrete payloads ever placed into orbit by a single U.S. orbital-class launch vehicle. And last May\u2019s Transporter-5 supported the first-of-its-kind robotic cutting of metals in orbit, in furtherance of future NanoRacks Space Outpost concepts. Yesterday, SpaceX offered its first outline of what the Transporter-6 mission will entail. \u201cThere are 114 payloads on this flight,\u201d the Hawthorne, Calif.-headquartered launch services provider tweeted, \u201cincluding CubeSats, microsats, picosats and orbital transfer vehicles carrying spacecraft to be deployed at a later time.\u201d It was also noted that the mission would fly no sooner than 9:56 a.m. EST Tuesday, 3 January, making it the first launch from the U.S. soil in the New Year. And with Elon Musk having been vocal in his intent to fly up to 100 times in 2023, it can be expected that SpaceX\u2019s most recent record\u2014achieved just yesterday\u2014of seven launches in a single calendar month will need to be not only equaled, but bettered. And key to hitting such vaulted targets will be booster reusability and turnaround. Kicking off the 2023 manifest is B1060, which entered service back on 30 June 2020 and is set to become only the second Falcon 9 core to log a 15th launch. On her first outing, B1060 deployed the third Block III Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation and timing satellite, bound for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). Since then, she went on to loft Turkey\u2019s powerful T\u00fcrksat 5A geostationary communications satellite, a total of 553 Starlink low-orbiting internet communications satellites, the multi-payload Transporter-2 mission and most recently the Galaxy 33/34 dual-stack last fall. This impressive raft of flights saw B1060 mark out her personal territory as the first Falcon 9 core to log a 13th launch in June 2022, before being narrowly beaten to 14th and 15th missions by fellow life-leader B1058. She also established a new record\u2014now broken\u2014of just 27 days between two launches by the same booster in spring 2021. Patrick Space Force Base\u2019s three-day outlook for a Tuesday morning opening launch attempt for Transporter-6 looks favorable, with around an 80-percent probability of acceptable conditions. This is tempered by a small risk of violating the Cumulus Cloud Rule and the Liftoff Winds Rule. \u201cOver the weekend, a weak boundary will pass through the area, bringing showers and a chance for a few storms late Saturday into early Sunday,\u201d the 45th noted in a Friday morning update. \u201cAnother frontal system is anticipated to affect the Spaceport and surrounding areas in the middle of next week. \u201cAhead of the front, a stronger pressure gradient will raise wind speeds,\u201d it was added. \u201cAs the high center moves off farther into the Atlantic, winds will also shift to become southeasterly.\u201d This is anticipated to threaten Tuesday\u2019s launch attempt via \u201ca chance for fast, onshore-moving Atlantic showers\u201d and a heightened risk of excessive liftoff winds. With B1060 tracking a landing at Landing Zone (LZ)-1 at the Cape, the Falcon 9\u2019s second stage will execute a customary six-minute \u201cburn\u201d of its single Merlin 1D+ Vacuum engine to deliver the Transporter-6 stack into orbit for deployment. And that deployment process is set to begin a little under an hour into Tuesday\u2019s mission. First out will be KuwaitSat-1, a technology demonstrator provided by Kuwait University. Then, over the following 33 minutes or so, the remaining payloads\u2014flying for the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Turkey, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy and the United States\u2014will deploy from their respective dispensers, some departing within a few seconds of each other. Key focuses span technology demonstrations to amateur radio, Earth observation to communications and air-traffic management to Internet of Things (IoT). Included in the mammoth Transporter-6 haul are a 36-strong \u201cflock\u201d of Earth imaging satellites, provided by Planet Labs, and 12 SpaceBEE two-way communications and data-relay satellites, supplied by Swarm Technologies, Inc. Although SpaceX reveals little in the way of detailed flight manifests, past precedent over the last several months permits a reasonable expectation of five or more launches in January. Specific missions targeted for 2023\u2019s opening month are a second stack of high-speed, low-latency broadband satellites for London, England-based OneWeb, a second pair of O3B mPOWER communications satellites for Luxembourg\u2019s SES and a pair of flights for the U.S. Space Force: the sixth Block III Global Positioning System (GPS) and a triple-barreled Falcon Heavy, laden with the highly secretive USSF-67 payload.

Kicking off the 2023 manifest is B1060, which entered service back on 30 June 2020 and is set to become only the second Falcon 9 core to log a 15th launch.\nOn her first outing, B1060 deployed the third Block III Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation and timing satellite, bound for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). Since then, she went on to loft Turkey\u2019s powerful T\u00fcrksat 5A geostationary communications satellite, a total of 553 Starlink low-orbiting internet communications satellites, the multi-payload Transporter-2 mission and most recently the Galaxy 33/34 dual-stack last fall.\n\nB1060 roars aloft in February 2021, carrying a 60-strong batch of Starlinks. On this launch, she set a new record of just 27 days between two launches by the same orbital-class booster. Photo Credit: Alan Walters/AmericaSpace\nThis impressive raft of flights saw B1060 mark out her personal territory as the first Falcon 9 core to log a 13th launch in June 2022, before being narrowly beaten to 14th and 15th missions by fellow life-leader B1058. She also established a new record\u2014now broken\u2014of just 27 days between two launches by the same booster in spring 2021.\nPatrick Space Force Base\u2019s three-day outlook for a Tuesday morning opening launch attempt for Transporter-6 looks favorable, with around an 80-percent probability of acceptable conditions. This is tempered by a small risk of violating the Cumulus Cloud Rule and the Liftoff Winds Rule.\n\nB1060 rises into the night in February 2021, bearing a stack of Starlink low-orbiting internet communications satellites.

Photo Credit: SpaceX\nWith B1060 tracking a landing at Landing Zone (LZ)-1 at the Cape, the Falcon 9\u2019s second stage will execute a customary six-minute \u201cburn\u201d of its single Merlin 1D+ Vacuum engine to deliver the Transporter-6 stack into orbit for deployment. And that deployment process is set to begin a little under an hour into Tuesday\u2019s mission.\nFirst out will be KuwaitSat-1, a technology demonstrator provided by Kuwait University. Then, over the following 33 minutes or so, the remaining payloads\u2014flying for the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Turkey, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy and the United States\u2014will deploy from their respective dispensers, some departing within a few seconds of each other.\n\nImage Credit: SpaceX\nKey focuses span technology demonstrations to amateur radio, Earth observation to communications and air-traffic management to Internet of Things (IoT). Included in the mammoth Transporter-6 haul are a 36-strong \u201cflock\u201d of Earth imaging satellites, provided by Planet Labs, and 12 SpaceBEE two-way communications and data-relay satellites, supplied by Swarm Technologies, Inc.\nAlthough SpaceX reveals little in the way of detailed flight manifests, past precedent over the last several months permits a reasonable expectation of five or more launches in January. Specific missions targeted for 2023\u2019s opening month are a second stack of high-speed, low-latency broadband satellites for London, England-based OneWeb, a second pair of O3B mPOWER communications satellites for Luxembourg\u2019s SES and a pair of flights for the U.S. Space Force: the sixth Block III Global Positioning System (GPS) and a triple-barreled Falcon Heavy, laden with the highly secretive USSF-67 payload.\nFOLLOW AmericaSpace on Facebook and Twitter!\nEmailTwitterFacebookPinterestRedditPocketPrintMoreLinkedInTumblrLike this:Like Loading... \n\nSpaceXFalcon 9SLC-40Space Launch Complex (SLC)-40B1060Cape Canaveral Space Force StationTransporter-6Landing Zone (LZ)-1\n\nSee more\n\nPrevious article SpaceX Wraps Up Banner 2022, With Year-End Launch of Israeli Spy Satellite\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From: SpaceX \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Wraps Up Banner 2022, With Year-End Launch of Israeli Spy Satellite\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 30, 2022, 2:57 am \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Launches Year\u2019s 60th Mission, Looks Ahead to Busy 2023\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 28, 2022, 2:47 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Heads for 60th Launch of 2022; East and West Coast Missions Planned Before New Year\u2019s Eve\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 27, 2022, 8:06 am \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob & Doug\u2019s Falcon 9 Makes 15th Launch, Sets New Records\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 17, 2022, 5:20 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Flies Twice in One Day, Aims for Third Launch on Saturday\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022, 6:14 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix-Times-Flown Falcon 9 Lofts SWOT Ocean Watcher from Vandenberg\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 16, 2022, 2:42 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Lofts Moon Lander, Rover, Ice-Seeker, Approaches 60-Launch Year\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 11, 2022, 2:50 am \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaezawa Identifies dearMoon Crewmates, As SpaceX Prepares for Sunday Lunar Launch\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 9, 2022, 12:02 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Resumes Falcon 9 Launches, Heads into Busy Year-End\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nDecember 8, 2022, 7:11 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Launches CRS-26 Cargo Dragon, Heads for Space Station\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nNovember 26, 2022, 2:52 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Looks Favorable for CRS-26 Launch, Spacewalkers Identified for Next iROSA Tasks\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nNovember 25, 2022, 6:00 am \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Launches Eutelsat 10B, Expends Long-Serving Falcon 9 Booster\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nNovember 23, 2022, 1:44 am \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX May Attempt Two Launches, Six Hours Apart Tuesday\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nNovember 21, 2022, 11:50 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Bids Farewell to the Old Guard, Expends 14x-Flown Falcon 9\n\n\n\n\nby\n\nBen Evans\n\n\nNovember 12, 2022, 1:17 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

          "Actor Madhuri Dixit\u2019s younger son Ryan is getting ready for college and is presently in the middle of the application process for admissions. In the latest episode of her husband Dr Sriram Nene\u2019s podcast, Madhuri and their sons Arin and Ryan, spoke about the admission process and how parents sometimes build a lot of pressure on their children to succeed. Madhuri asked her 17-year-old son Ryan about his thoughts on parents who are completely invested in their children\u2019s application process. Ryan said, \u201cI think kids, kind of, need more space. Sure, for me, I need a bit of push to actually do stuff but I think people need some space when it comes to applications because applications need to be a mixed bag of things. I mean you are competing against your closest friends for the same college.\u201d     A post shared by Madhuri Dixit (@madhuridixitnene) He went to on say, \u201cIt\u2019s like a rat race where you are competing with students from all over the globe where you have to worry about just what others have achieved because that is going to impact what your preferences are. I see that sort of myself. It\u2019s not a great feeling at all because you end up thinking that maybe \u2018I should have done this or that\u2019. Parents can pack on a lot of pressure because there is a certain goal that they have in mind for where their kids should be.\u201d Ryan added that his parents are not the same way and said, \u201cI know it\u2019s a common occurrence, luckily these guys (pointing at his parents) don\u2019t have that sort of a thing in mind.\u201d To this, Sriram Nene joked, \u201cI have not paid him anything to say that\u201d and Madhuri added, \u201cWe have not bribed him.\u201d In the last episode, their older son Arin had spoken about living alone in the US and managing life on his own and how he is learning to manage food and living without any help.

          "In 2022, decades of work finally came to fruition as the James Webb Space Telescope fired up and began training its unprecedented eyes on the universe. From distant galaxies to our nearby neighbors, let\u2019s look back at some of the most impressive images the telescope has captured so far. The successor to Hubble, James Webb scans the skies in infrared, and that combined with the unprecedented size of its mirror allows the telescope to peer deeper into space and further back in time than any other observatory. Using this power, Webb\u2019s mission is to study the formation and evolution of stars, planets and galaxies, especially those that formed soon after the Big Bang. It may even find the first signs of extraterrestrial life. NASA released the first batch of images to the public in July, including a view of a distant cluster of galaxies magnified by a gravitational lens, a nebula cast off from a dying star and another that\u2019s birthing new ones. Since then, James Webb has been busy producing image after stunning image, revealing new details of galaxies, nebulae and famous celestial landmarks like the Pillars of Creation. Closer to home, it showed Jupiter in a new light, and gave us the clearest look yet at Neptune\u2019s rings. And of course, this is just the beginning. James Webb is planned to examine the cosmos for at least the next decade, and if it\u2019s anything like its predecessor Hubble, its mission could be extended for another decade beyond that. So come take a look through the highlights of the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s first six months in operation in our gallery. Source: NASA on Flickr",

          " A Washington man allegedly transferred thousands of dollars from his employer into a personal account after being inspired by the 1999 cult movie \u201cOffice Space,\u201d according to an arrest report by the Seattle Police Department. A Washington man allegedly transferred thousands of dollars from his employer into a personal account after being inspired by the 1999 cult movie \"Office Space,\" according to an arrest report by the Seattle Police Department. Ermenildo Valdez Castro, 28, worked for the online retailer Zulily as a software engineer from December 2018 until he was fired in June, according to police. \"Starting in the spring of 2022, Castro began editing Zulily's software code in ways that allowed him to steal from the company,\" the police report said. Police said Castro inserted three types of malicious code in the checkout process at Zulily and by using those methods, \"stole a combined $302,278.52 before he was terminated in June 2022.\" Zulily's fraud team was able to discover a pattern of price adjustments on several products that were sold by the company, which police said were ordered by Castro and shipped to his residence, the report said. A OneNote document on Castro's work laptop called \"OfficeSpace Project\" was found through the investigation, and in it, a \"scheme to steal shipping fees,\" was outlined, according to the report. The police report also notes the plot of the movie \"Office Space\" revolved around engineers who produced a plan to move fractions of cents into a personal bank account. Castro was contacted by police and arrested on June 21. On that date he spoke with detectives after being read his rights. During that interview he \"confirmed that he named his scheme to steal from Zulily after the movie,\" police said. Castro also told authorities he placed orders for over 1,000 items that were shipped to his house, and that they were part of a \"testing process that Zulily was aware about, but he claimed that there was a script that was to be run shortly thereafter that would essentially cancel the order and ensure the orders did not process,\" the report said. \"He said the test orders would have to be billed to a personal credit card, thus his changing of the items' prices, as to avoid incurring a large expense on his personal credit card. He said he forgot to run the script; therefore, the orders shipped. He admitted that he did not ever notify Zulily staff of the orders being delivered,\" the police report said. Castro also told police he threw many of the items away once he was fired. \"When asked why he never returned the items to Zulily, he said that once they fired him, his opinion was, 'F**k 'em,'\" the report said. On December 20, Daniel Satterberg, the prosecuting attorney for King County, filed charges of theft in the first degree and identity theft in the first degree in the Superior Court of Washington for King County against Castro. As of Friday afternoon, the King County Superior Court Clerk's Office website did not list an attorney for Castro. The-CNN-Wire \u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

          " Copyright \u00a9 HT Media Limited  All rights reserved.  The space exploration enthusiasts around the world have been brimming with excitement ever since the moment the NASA James Webb Space Telescope was first launched in 2021. And after it was placed into its orbit and began peering into space, it did not disappoint. NASA's new eyes in space captured breathtaking images of celestial bodies both known and unknown. And just after half a year of hard work, it has shown us enough glances into space that will inspire years of research in astronomy. Read on to know about the top 5 JWST discoveries that shocked the world in 2022. We all knew about the Pillars of Creation, the elephant trunks of interstellar gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula due to the Hubble Telescope. But when the James Webb Space Telescope captured an image of it through its infrared imaging, scientists were able to spot a high number of protostars. A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud and not yet burning hydrogen. This was a big revelation as the site was previously assumed to be a site for star birth but it could never be proven earlier. Scientists have been able to take a few direct images of exoplanets throughout the decades, but it is an enormously difficult task. While stars illuminate, thus making capturing their image easy, exoplanets are normally seen as dip in the light of their star. However, NASA JWST was able to capture the direct image of a planet, HIP 65426 b, without a fuss. This is being considered a transformative moment as this can lead to us taking a look at more exoplanets in space. The Webb telescope took a strange image of a star in July which was surrounded by a boxy ripple-like effect of concentric circles. This was a Wolf-Rayet star named WR 140. These stars are at the late stage of their life. These ring-like patterns are created due to an interaction with a companion star which has focused space dust in that shape due to the effect of gravity. To see such a star is an incredibly rare event and it has already inspired multiple studies. NASA James Webb Space Telescope was also credited with discovering the farthest galaxy we have ever known in mid-December when it discovered GN-z11. No other human made telescope was able to see so far into space. Due to the light taking such a long time to reach us, it was also the oldest galaxy we have ever seen. Analysis has revealed that the image of the galaxy was taken just 350 million years after the Big Bang event. When the Webb telescope took a look at WASP-39b in the Virgo constellation, placed around 700 lightyears away from the Earth, it was able to confirm the presence of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. This is the first time when scientists have been able to know the gas present in an exoplanet.

          "By NASA\nDecember 31, 2022The International Space Station continues its scientific journey orbiting over 200 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface.Spacecraft carried crew from around the world to and from the space station, where they participated in and supported hundreds of scientific investigations and technology demonstrations this past year. From deploying CubeSats to studying fluid dynamics in space, the orbiting lab expanded its legacy of science and discovery for the benefit of humanity.Look back at some of the best photos of breakthrough science the crew members conducted in 2022.Understanding microgravity movementNASA astronaut Bob Hines participates in the GRASP investigation to help researchers better understand if and how gravity acts as a reference for the control of reach-to-grasp movement. The information could provide further insight into the human body\u2019s adaptation to the microgravity environment.

The experiment provides hardware to allow for the study and characterization of the ignition and flammability of solid spacecraft materials in realistic atmospheric conditions.Let the fluids flowA view of a transparent FLUIDICS sphere aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The FLUIDICS investigation evaluates the Center of Mass (CoM) position regarding a temperature gradient on a representation of a fuel tank. The observation of capillary wave turbulence on the surface of a fluid layer in a low-gravity environment can provide insights into measuring the existing volume in a sphere. Credit: NASAA view of a transparent FLUIDICS sphere aboard the International Space Station. The investigation covers two aspects of fluid mechanics: the analysis of liquid sloshing phenomena in tanks of spacecraft in microgravity and the wave turbulence phenomena that occurs at the surface of liquids. The investigation could support development of better fuel systems for satellites and may provide a better understanding of how the Earth\u2019s oceans work.Unlocking the cotton genomeNASA astronaut and Expedition 66 Flight Engineer Raja Chari performs the final harvest of cotton cell cultures as part of the Plant Habitat-05 investigation (PH-05).

          "FREE Breaking News Alerts from StreetInsider.com! \nStreetInsider.com Top Tickers, 12/31/2022  SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nMomentus Inc. (NASDAQ: MNTS) (\"Momentus\" or the \"Company\"), a U.S. commercial space company that offers transportation and other in-space infrastructure services, is wrapping up 2022 with significant accomplishments and a focus on taking strides toward achieving its vision in 2023.\n \n\u201c2022 was a big year for Momentus. We conducted our first mission, delivered eight customer payloads to orbit, expanded our services to new geographies, signed service agreements with civil and commercial customers, and continued to test and advance our technology to support the future of space infrastructure,\u201d said Momentus Chief Executive Officer John Rood. \u201cAs we look ahead to next year, our focus remains on delivering for our customers, testing our technologies in space, and innovating our services to meet the needs of a thriving space economy.\u201d\n \nFirst Flight\n \nMomentus established initial flight heritage of its Vigoride Orbital Service Vehicle (OSV) that launched on the SpaceX Transporter-5 mission in May 2022. Vigoride welcomed payloads for FOSSA Systems, Orbit NTNU, and California State Polytechnic University among its customers. FOSSA\u2019s payload featured multiple picosatellites as part of a constellation to provide global and real-time Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity for industrial applications. Orbit NTNU\u2019s payload, SelfieSat, supported a student-led initiative from Norway. California State Polytechnic University\u2019s payload, BroncoSat-1, featured a technology demonstration. In total, Momentus deployed eight satellites from its Vigoride OSV and a third-party deployer.\n \nNew Business\n \nMomentus secured multiple new agreements in 2022 to serve the needs of low-Earth orbit customers, including NASA, LuxSpace, CUAVA, and CONTEC CO. These customers join a backlog of others scheduled to fly with Momentus in 2023.\n \nIn addition to these contracts, Momentus and Sidus Space signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to explore launching LizzieSat\u2122 satellites onboard Vigoride. The MOU also seeks to foster collaboration between the two companies to use their joint capabilities to seek new opportunities together, expanding both firms\u2019 reach.\n \nAdvancing Technology\n \nThe Momentus team continued to develop and test its technology this year with a focus on integrating lessons learned from the inaugural mission, including comprehensive ground testing of Vigoride\u2019s solar arrays and Microwave Electrothermal Thruster (MET).\n \n\u201cWe made improvements to our systems following continued ground testing, and after applying the lessons we learned from our first mission,\u201d said Rood.\n \nThe team also accelerated work related to the TApe Spring Solar Array (TASSA). These large sheets of flexible solar cells are bonded to tape springs. To stow, they are tightly coiled around a mandrel. After launch, motors unroll the mandrel, deploying the solar array.\n \n\u201cMomentus has patented the principles behind TASSA, and we aim to demonstrate it in 2023,\u201d said Momentus Chief Technology Officer Rob Schwarz. \u201cTASSA can coil around a 4'' diameter mandrel, compared to the 12'' ones used for other rollout solar arrays. It can also experience thermal distortions without buckling. We anticipate creating operational and cost efficiencies with this technology.\u201d\n \nIn addition, technology development to support Rendezvous and Proximity Operations has advanced, including a successful design review in October with Momentus\u2019 technology partners. The team is looking forward to a flight demonstration with Vigoride-7 targeted to launch on the SpaceX Transporter-8 mission, slated for June 2023. Rendezvous and Proximity Operations will enable future Vigoride vehicles to interact with other objects in space, paving the way for a next-generation reusable OSV and in-space services such as debris removal, end-of-life de-orbit, relocation, and mission enhancement.\n \nDeveloping the Team\n \nThe Company further developed its leadership team by welcoming seasoned aerospace and technology industry executives who bring unrivaled talent and experience in shaping successful outcomes for civil and military government and commercial programs. Strategic executive new hires in 2022 included:\n \n\u201cThe team we put in place in 2022 will be integral to our future success,\u201d said Rood. \u201cOur leadership team is experienced in driving results, and they are supported by a talented, technically savvy, and enthusiastic group of employees. People are the story behind successful technology, and I have tremendous confidence in our team.\u201d\n \nLooking Ahead\n \nMomentus has signed Launch Services Agreements with SpaceX to reserve space on the next four Transporter rideshare missions that are targeted to occur in 2023. The next Vigoride OSV is slated to fly on the SpaceX Transporter-6 mission, targeted for launch in January 2023.\n \nThis flight will mark Momentus\u2019 second demonstration mission of its Vigoride OSV. Mission priorities include hosting Caltech\u2019s Space-based Solar Power Project payload, deploying Qosmosys\u2019 Zeus-1 payload, and testing Vigoride\u2019s performance in space, particularly related to its MET propulsion. The MET is designed to use water as a propellant and produce thrust by expelling extremely hot gases through a rocket nozzle. However, unlike a conventional chemical rocket engine, which creates thrust through a chemical reaction, the MET is designed to create a plasma and thrust using microwave energy. Using the MET, Momentus aims to offer cost-effective, efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly propulsion to meet the demands for in-space transportation and infrastructure services. The Vigoride OSV and its MET are next-generation systems enhanced from the previous versions that flew on the Company\u2019s first demonstration mission earlier this year.\n \n\u201cMomentus is rallying around its near-term focus of demonstrating the capabilities of its initial services in low-Earth orbit,\u201d said Rood. \u201cIn 2023, we\u2019ll continue to develop our technology to build reliability, flexibility, and responsiveness to the critical mission demands of the industry like de-orbiting, in-space satellite maintenance and repair, and other advanced in-space transportation and infrastructure services.\u201d\n \nAbout Momentus\n \nMomentus is a U.S. commercial space company that offers in-space infrastructure services, including in-space transportation, hosted payloads and in-orbit services. Momentus believes it can make new ways of operating in space possible with its in-space transfer and service vehicles that will be powered by an innovative water plasma-based propulsion system that is under development.\n \nForward-Looking Statements\n \nThis press release contains certain statements which may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of the federal securities laws.

Updated: December 31, 2022 @ 11:57 am   The light trail is seen in Goyang, South Korea, Friday. South Korea's military confirmed it test-fired a solid-fueled rocket on Friday, after its unannounced launch triggered brief public scare of a suspected UFO appearance or a North Korean missile or drone flying. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korea\u2019s military confirmed it test-fired a solid-fueled rocket Friday after its unannounced launch triggered brief public scare of a suspected UFO appearance or a North Korean missile launch. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that the rocket launch was part of its efforts to build a space-based surveillance capability and bolster its defense posture. It said it didn\u2019t notify the general public of the launch in advance because it involved sensitive military security issues. A twisty tendril of vapor in white-to-red ombre could be seen snaking behind a bright white light in parts of South Korea\u2019s sky Friday evening. South Korean social media and internet sites were abuzz with messages by citizens who said they saw a soaring object, rainbow-colored vapor trail or other mysterious lights. Some also posted photos and videos. \u201cWhat is this? Is this a UFO? I\u2019m scared,\u201d said one Twitter user. Another said they suspected it was a North Korean missile launch and worried about a war, while a third said they believed a North Korean spy operating in South Korea was sending a signal back to the North. Others suspected it was a supernatural phenomenon. South Korean emergency offices and police received hundreds of citizens\u2019 reports of witnessing of a suspicious flying object and mysterious lights across the country, according to local media. The South Korean rocket launch came four days after the South accused the North of flying five drones across the rivals\u2019 border Monday for the first time in five years. South Korea\u2019s military detected the drones but failed to shoot them down, causing security concerns about its air defense network. The military later offered a rare apology for that. South Korean officials said they plan to use a solid-fueled rocket to put the nation's first spy satellite into orbit. In March, South Korea conducted its first successful launch of a solid-fuel rocket. Solid-fuel rockets reduce launch times, have simpler structures and are cheaper to develop and manufacture than liquid-fuel rockets, South Korean officials said. The Defense Ministry said Friday\u2019s launch was a follow-up test of the March launch. North Korea is also pushing to develop its first military surveillance satellite and other high-tech weapons systems to cope with what it calls U.S. hostility. Earlier this year, North Korea performed a record number of missile tests in what experts call a bid to prefect its nuclear weapons technology and boost its leverage in future dealings with the United States.

          "It was a great year for a slight lifting of the veil on the final frontier \u2013 from redirecting an asteroid to a glimpse into creation The year has been a blast in space exploration, from Nasa\u2019s big step in returning to moon missions, to glimpses at the origins of the universe and hope that humanity could survive the doomsday scenario of an asteroid hurtling towards Earth. These are the events that shaped 2022 in space advances: Nasa hadn\u2019t sent a crew-capable spacecraft to the moon for half a century when Artemis 1 blasted off from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral in November. Atop the mighty Space Launch System (SLS), the most powerful rocket in history, the unoccupied next-generation Orion capsule flew 1.3m miles on a 25-day flight to test the hardware and support systems for sending humans back to the lunar surface and beyond. Orion splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 11 December, 50 years to the day since two Apollo 17 astronauts became the last of only 12 moonwalkers in history. Mission managers are still assessing data from the Artemis mission but the program looks on track for a crewed lunar flyby in 2024 and a scheduled moon landing the year after. In July, the $10bn James Webb space telescope sent back the highest resolution images ever seen of distant galaxies as they were billions of years ago, promising astronomers a glimpse into the dawn of creation. The stunning clear color pictures of the unseen universe were hailed by the Nasa chief, Bill Nelson, as a new era in astronomy, showcasing Webb\u2019s ability to peer back 13.5bn years, close to the big bang. \u201cWe are going back almost to the beginning,\u201d he said. In November, Webb found two more galaxies, one that may have formed just 350m years after the big bang. In a \u201cwatershed moment for planetary defense\u201d in September, Nasa crashed a multimillion-dollar, car-sized spacecraft into an asteroid the size of a football stadium and proved for the first time it could alter the orbit of a celestial body. The Dart mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was an unprecedented experiment of the space agency\u2019s capacity to defend Earth from the doomsday scenario of a huge asteroid on a collision course. The impact shortened the orbit of Dimorphos around the larger Didymos asteroid by about 32 minutes, to 11 hours and 23 minutes. The first all-private crew of astronauts returned from the International Space Station (ISS) in April, the three wealthy paying guests joining a former space shuttle commander onboard the Axiom 1 flight on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched at Cape Canaveral. The civilian astronauts, Larry Connor, Eytan Stibbe and Mark Pathy, paid an estimated $55m for the 17-day mission, during which they joined US and Russian crews aboard the ISS and conducted more than 25 research projects, incorporating regenerative medicine and space technology. Former Nasa chief astronaut Peggy Whitson is slated to command Axiom 2 in May 2023. The potential for humans to one day live on the red planet came a step closer in August when researchers announced that a lunchbox-sized instrument named Moxie (Mars oxygen in-situ resource utilization experiment) had been generating breathable oxygen. Moxie, part of Nasa\u2019s Perseverance astrobiology project on Mars, was successful in producing oxygen over seven experimental runs, in a variety of atmospheric conditions, day and night, through different Martian seasons. Each run produced at least 6g of oxygen an hour, similar to the rate of a modest tree on Earth. Scaled-up versions of Moxie could become part of the Nasa Artemis program that aims to land humans on Mars in the 2030s. China\u2019s space program sparked global outrage in November when a chunk of a rocket used to deliver a module to its new Tiangong space station fell to Earth uncontrolled, triggering the closure of European airspace and hundreds of flight delays. It was the second time in 2022 that parts of China\u2019s Long March rockets had threatened populated areas, prompting calls from space experts for the \u201cirresponsible\u201d country to clean up its act. Chinese space debris has previously fallen on the Maldives and India. China completed construction of Tiangong for a crew of three in 2022, and is already considering expansion. The Russian space agency Roscosmos announced in July it was to end its two-decade partnership with the US over the International Space Station, and planned to focus on building its own orbiting outpost. Analysts linked the move to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as US-Russian tensions grew over the conflict. The announcement came barely three months after a crew of Russian cosmonauts boarded the ISS in the yellow and blue colors of the Ukraine flag. Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin reportedly replied \u201cgood\u201d when Yuri Borisov, the newly appointed head of Roscosmos, told him Russia was out after fulfilling ISS obligations to 2024. Boeing joined Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX in May as the only commercial companies to have docked their space vehicles at the International Space Station, a major step forward in its plans to ferry humans aboard its Starliner crew capsule. SpaceX continues to dominate the commercial space market with two crewed missions to the ISS in 2022, among the 61 total launches it planned this year. Boeing, a long-time partner of Nasa, has trailed SpaceX in development of a crew capsule. Its first crewed Starliner test flight has been delayed until no earlier than April 2023.",

Every year, space and astronomy are bigger and bigger - more exciting missions, new discoveries, and unimaginable views of the universe. Here are my top 10 events and discoveries of 2022. First off is Axiom space and the first private mission to the International Space Station. In 2021, we saw the beginning of space tourism with Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, and SpaceX all taking private tourists up. Axiom, a private company comprised of many former NASA astronauts and even a former head of NASA, worked with SpaceX to take private people to the International Space Station as tourist-astronauts. It was essentially the first space working holiday.  At number 9, NASA announced that the 5000th exoplanet had been confirmed. An exoplanet is an extra-solar planet, a planet orbiting around another star, not our Sun in our Solar System. The first exoplanet was discovered back in 1992 and before then, we had only known of planets in our own Solar System. Hundreds more have been confirmed just this year, with tens of thousands awaiting final confirmation, and billions more to discover.  This year we also saw the completion of China's Tiangong Space Station. Late last year, China announced they were aiming to finish their space station by the end of this year. To do so, it would require multiple missions including sending up the remaining two modules to complete it. It seemed ambitious at the time, and last month, China completed it. It was a huge milestone for China's space program and a sign of how quickly they are moving in space. We also saw the proverbially passing of the baton on Mars, as one mission ends and another prepares for a future mission. NASA's InSight, after four years on Mars discovering Marsquakes and studying the layers underneath the surface of Mars, has come to an end. It even sent a sad, final message to Earth. The same week, NASA's Perseverance rover began collecting and storing samples in 15-centimetre titanium tubes. In a few years, two drones will come, collect them, and take them to a rocket for a return to the Earth to be studied in the lab. The war in Ukraine has been one of the most disturbing, and biggest, stories of the year. It has also shown a new way space is affecting life on Earth. Private space companies have supplied internet to keep Ukrainian weapons and systems working, imaging to track movements, and more. Space technology is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our lives, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that. Cracking the top 5 was a discovery by Dalgety sheep farmers Jock Wallace and Mick Miners. On July 9, the SpaceX Crew-1 trunk broke up and re-entered over NSW. A few weeks later, the two neighbours found pieces of it in their paddocks. After getting in touch with me and identifying it, the Australian 5 Space Agency worked with SpaceX to confirm it. The discovery highlighted just how big the space junk problem was becoming. Since then, multiple piece have been found as far west as Tumbarumba. In June and July, NASA launched three sounding rockets from the Yolgnu country in the Northern Territory. Decades since the last rocket launch from Australia, Equatorial Launch Australia set-up the first commercial spaceport in Australia. It was a big step forward for Australia's space industry. Next year we are likely to see three spaceports in action in Australia.  Coming in at number three, was the long awaited, and multiple-times delayed, Artemis mission. Artemis I was NASA's beginning at getting humans back to the Moon. Artemis uses the Space Launch System, the most powerful rocket ever. It wasn't just the US sending missions to the Moon either. Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the UAE also have their own missions launched to the Moon this year. At the end of September, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) reached the asteroid Didymos and performed a manouever straight out of Hollywood. Travelling nearly 24,000km/hr the probe crashed straight into the asteroid, in a test to see if we could shift an asteroid in case one was headed for Earth. Through the use of AI and precision engineering, not only did it work, it shifted the asteroid three times more than calculated - a whopping success. And the top story of the year without a doubt is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). After over three decades of development, JWST was launched on Christmas last year. The telescope hosts a 6.5-metre mirror, and with its ability to look in different colours of light than the Hubble Space Telescope, it promised to deliver new views of the Universe. After a six-month wait to get the telescope tested, aligned, and up and running, it has more than delivered on the eager expectations of astronomers. From breathtaking views of nebula, to spotting the most distant galaxies of the Universe, new views of planets like Jupiter, and even the ability to measure the atmosphere of planets around other stars, detecting carbon dioxide, water vapour, and more, JWST has been the truly outstanding.

          "By Macy Huston and Jason Wright, Penn State\nDecember 30, 2022Astronomers have been looking for radio waves sent by a distant civilization for more than 60 years.If an alien were to look at Earth, many human technologies \u2013 from cell towers to fluorescent light bulbs \u2013 could be a beacon signifying the presence of life.We are two astronomers who work on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence \u2013 or SETI. In our research, we try to characterize and detect signs of technology originating from beyond Earth. These are called technosignatures. While scanning the sky for a TV broadcast of some extraterrestrial Olympics may sound straightforward, searching for signs of distant, advanced civilizations is a much more nuanced and difficult task than it might seem.Saying \u2018hello\u2019 with radios and lasersThe modern scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence began in 1959 when astronomers Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison showed that radio transmissions from Earth could be detected by radio telescopes at interstellar distances. The same year, Frank Drake, launched the first SETI search, Project Ozma, by pointing a large radio telescope at two nearby Sun-like stars to see if he could detect any radio signals coming from them. Following the invention of the laser in 1960, astronomers showed that visible light could also be detected from distant planets.A laser \u2013 like the one seen here \u2013 or beam of radio waves pointed intentionally at Earth would be a strong sign of extraterrestrial life. Credit: G. H\u00fcdepohl/ESOThese first, foundational attempts to detect radio or laser signals from another civilization were all looking for focused, powerful signals that would have been intentionally sent to the solar system and meant to be found.Given the technological limitations of the 1960s, astronomers did not give serious thought to searching for broadcast signals \u2013 like television and radio broadcasts on Earth \u2013 that would leak into space. But a beam of a radio signal, with all of its power focused towards Earth, could be detectable from much farther away \u2013 just picture the difference between a laser and a weak light bulb.The search for intentional radio and laser signals is still one of the most popular SETI strategies today. However, this approach assumes that extraterrestrial civilizations want to communicate with other technologically advanced life. Humans very rarely send targeted signals into space, and some scholars argue that intelligent species may purposefully avoid broadcasting out their locations. This search for signals that no one may be sending is called the SETI Paradox.This artist\u2019s impression shows the Square Kilometer Array, a telescope array currently being built in both Australia and Africa that will be sensitive enough to detect the equivalent of radio broadcasts from distant planets. Credit: SPDO/TDP/DRAO/Swinburne Astronomy ProductionsLeaking radio wavesThough humans don\u2019t transmit many intentional signals out to the cosmos, many technologies people use today produce a lot of radio transmissions that leak into space. Some of these signals would be detectable if they came from a nearby star.The worldwide network of television towers constantly emits signals in many directions that leak into space and can accumulate into a detectable, though relatively faint, radio signal. Research is ongoing as to whether current emissions from cell towers in the radio frequency on Earth would be detectable using today\u2019s telescopes, but the upcoming Square Kilometer Array radio telescope will be able to detect even fainter radio signals with 50 times the sensitivity of current radio telescope arrays.Not all human-made signals are so unfocused, though. Astronomers and space agencies use beams of radio waves to communicate with satellites and spacecraft in the solar system. Some researchers also use radio waves for radar to study asteroids. In both of these cases, the radio signals are more focused and pointed out into space. Any extraterrestrial civilization that happened to be in the line of sight of these beams could likely detect these unambiguously artificial signals.A Dyson Sphere is a theoretical megastructure that would surround a star and collect its light to use as energy. Credit: Kevin Gill/FlickrFinding megastructuresAside from finding an actual alien spacecraft, radio waves are the most common technosignatures featured in sci-fi movies and books. But they are not the only signals that could be out there.In 1960, astronomer Freeman Dyson theorized that, since stars are by far the most powerful energy source in any planetary system, a technologically advanced civilization might collect a significant portion of the star\u2019s light as energy with what would essentially be a massive solar panel. Many astronomers call these megastructures, and there are a few ways to detect them.After using the energy in the captured light, the technology of an advanced society would re-emit some of the energy as heat. Astronomers have shown that this heat could be detectable as extra infrared radiation coming from a star system.Another possible way to find a megastructure would be to measure its dimming effect on a star. Specifically, large artificial satellites orbiting a star would periodically block some of its light. This would appear as dips in the star\u2019s apparent brightness over time. Astronomers could detect this effect similarly to how distant planets are discovered today.Advanced civilizations may produce a lot of pollution in the form of chemicals, light and heat that can be detected across the vast distances of space. Credit: NASA/Jay FreidlanderA whole lot of pollutionAnother technosignature that astronomers have thought about is pollution.Chemical pollutants \u2013 like nitrogen dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons on Earth are almost exclusively produced by human industry. It is possible to detect these molecules in the atmospheres of exoplanets with the same method the James Webb Space Telescope is using to search distant planets for signs of biology. If astronomers find a planet with an atmosphere filled with chemicals that can only be produced by technology, it may be a sign of life.Finally, artificial light or heat from cities and industry could also be detectable with large optical and infrared telescopes, as would a large number of satellites orbiting a planet. But a civilization would need to produce far more heat, light, and satellites than Earth does to be detectable across the vastness of space using technology humans currently possess.Which signal is best?No astronomer has ever found a confirmed technosignature, so it\u2019s hard to say what will be the first sign of alien civilizations. While many astronomers have thought a lot about what might make for a good signal, ultimately, nobody knows what extraterrestrial technology might look like and what signals are out there in the Universe.Some astronomers support a generalized SETI approach which searches for anything in space that current scientific knowledge cannot naturally explain. Some, like us, continue to search for both intentional and unintentional technosignatures. The bottom line is that there are many avenues for detecting distant life. Since no one knows what approach is likely to succeed first, there is still a lot of exciting work left to do.Written by:Macy Huston \u2013 PhD Candidate in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Penn StateJason Wright \u2013 Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Penn StateThis article was first published in The Conversation.

          "Signatures of Alien Technology: The Key to Finding Intelligent Extraterrestrial LifeTOPICS:AstronomyPenn State UniversityThe ConversationBy Macy Huston and Jason Wright, Penn State\nDecember 30, 2022Astronomers have been looking for radio waves sent by a distant civilization for more than 60 years.If an alien were to look at Earth, many human technologies \u2013 from cell towers to fluorescent light bulbs \u2013 could be a beacon signifying the presence of life.We are two astronomers who work on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence \u2013 or SETI. In our research, we try to characterize and detect signs of technology originating from beyond Earth. These are called technosignatures. While scanning the sky for a TV broadcast of some extraterrestrial Olympics may sound straightforward, searching for signs of distant, advanced civilizations is a much more nuanced and difficult task than it might seem.Saying \u2018hello\u2019 with radios and lasersThe modern scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence began in 1959 when astronomers Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison showed that radio transmissions from Earth could be detected by radio telescopes at interstellar distances. The same year, Frank Drake, launched the first SETI search, Project Ozma, by pointing a large radio telescope at two nearby Sun-like stars to see if he could detect any radio signals coming from them. Following the invention of the laser in 1960, astronomers showed that visible light could also be detected from distant planets.A laser \u2013 like the one seen here \u2013 or beam of radio waves pointed intentionally at Earth would be a strong sign of extraterrestrial life. Credit: G. H\u00fcdepohl/ESOThese first, foundational attempts to detect radio or laser signals from another civilization were all looking for focused, powerful signals that would have been intentionally sent to the solar system and meant to be found.Given the technological limitations of the 1960s, astronomers did not give serious thought to searching for broadcast signals \u2013 like television and radio broadcasts on Earth \u2013 that would leak into space. But a beam of a radio signal, with all of its power focused towards Earth, could be detectable from much farther away \u2013 just picture the difference between a laser and a weak light bulb.The search for intentional radio and laser signals is still one of the most popular SETI strategies today. However, this approach assumes that extraterrestrial civilizations want to communicate with other technologically advanced life. Humans very rarely send targeted signals into space, and some scholars argue that intelligent species may purposefully avoid broadcasting out their locations. This search for signals that no one may be sending is called the SETI Paradox.This artist\u2019s impression shows the Square Kilometer Array, a telescope array currently being built in both Australia and Africa that will be sensitive enough to detect the equivalent of radio broadcasts from distant planets. Credit: SPDO/TDP/DRAO/Swinburne Astronomy ProductionsLeaking radio wavesThough humans don\u2019t transmit many intentional signals out to the cosmos, many technologies people use today produce a lot of radio transmissions that leak into space. Some of these signals would be detectable if they came from a nearby star.The worldwide network of television towers constantly emits signals in many directions that leak into space and can accumulate into a detectable, though relatively faint, radio signal. Research is ongoing as to whether current emissions from cell towers in the radio frequency on Earth would be detectable using today\u2019s telescopes, but the upcoming Square Kilometer Array radio telescope will be able to detect even fainter radio signals with 50 times the sensitivity of current radio telescope arrays.Not all human-made signals are so unfocused, though. Astronomers and space agencies use beams of radio waves to communicate with satellites and spacecraft in the solar system. Some researchers also use radio waves for radar to study asteroids. In both of these cases, the radio signals are more focused and pointed out into space. Any extraterrestrial civilization that happened to be in the line of sight of these beams could likely detect these unambiguously artificial signals.A Dyson Sphere is a theoretical megastructure that would surround a star and collect its light to use as energy.
