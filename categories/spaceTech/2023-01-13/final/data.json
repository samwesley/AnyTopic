The show explores the movement of life in the solar system as a journey through space. With dancers using the energy of their bodies and the power of motion to convey ideas and stories, the audience will encounter a multimedia experience combining dance, technology, and design to express the connection between humanity, the universe, and creativity. Student dancers include the RIT DanceCore ensemble.\n\nWarfield, a Rochester, N.Y., native, has performed as a singer, dancer, actor, model, composer, choreographer, director, producer, educator, activist, and poet on stage, television, and in film in more than 100 cities worldwide. He has performed at the Metropolitan Opera, The Yard on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a circus in Japan, in three U.S. prisons, and for Queen Elizabeth II, in addition to solo concerts. His East Coast tour of his original project, AstroDance, combined dance and astrophysics and was funded by the National Science Foundation. He has worked with director Spike Lee, composers John Adams and Marvin Hamlisch, scientist Carl Sagan, and singers Placido Domingo and Beverly Sills, and has worked with and danced in works by choreographers Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Jose Limon, Robert Joffrey, Bill T. Jones, and many others.\n\nAt RIT, he has served as chair of the President\u2019s Commission on Pluralism and Inclusion and Performing Arts Task Force. He is the founder and artistic director of PeaceArt International, a global outreach organization, and former trainer for the National Coalition Building Institute. He serves as vice president of the MuCCC Theatre board, is former president of ARTWalk, founding member of the Association of Teaching Artists, and is president emeritus of the William Warfield Scholarship Fund at Eastman School of Music.

APStar 6E launched with a separable propulsion system that will boost the satellite into a higher orbit, after which the satellite's own propulsion will complete the months-long journey to geostationary orbit.\n\nAPStar 6E is planned to operate for a service lifetime of 15 years from a position fixed over 134 degrees east latitude. From there it will provide 30 gigabits per second payload capacity with 25 Ku-band and 3 Ka-band user beams.\n\nThe launch was China's third of the year. CASC, China's state-owned main space contractor, is planning to launch more than 50 times this year, including sending cargo and crew missions to the country's Tiangong space station .",

Just one effort among many, Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems advance high power microwave technology, command and control decision aids, and high energy lasers, among several other capabilities.\n\nThe urgency of this effort is being spurred by the seemingly endless proliferation of UAS that are seen as low-cost, high-reward assets for surveillance, intelligence gathering, and even lethal attacks on U.S. personnel and interests.\n\nThe U.S. Army is leading the effort, but all the U.S. military branches are expected to benefit from the program. Since the Army announced the release of the DoD C-sUAS Strategy in January 2021, the program has been progressing steadily and devoting significant time to testing and evaluating the many C-sUAS devices already being offered for sale by multiple contractors.\n\nThe multiple contract awards and fielding announcements over the past year for C-sUAS systems to enhance security efforts within the U.S. military are a good indicator of the types of technology the Army is seeking to advance.\n\nIn April 2022, Liteye Systems announced the delivery of its SHIELD system to the U.S. Army in 2021 through a multiyear contract to integrate the system payload into a high laser energy (HEL) C-sUAS effort. According to Liteye, the system can be layered with multiple effectors and battle management systems to detect, track, identify and defeat multiple threats.\n\nIn July 2022, the U.S. Marine Corps announced the fielding of the Installation-Counter small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (I-CsUAS) which is intended to defeat commercial off-the-shelf Group 1 and Group 2 UAS. I-CsUAS also provides detection, tracking and identification capabilities.\n\nBased on an estimated projection of the FY23 U.S. defense budget, $208 million will be spent on the U.S. Army\u2019s Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Development program effort through 2031.\n\nForecast International\u2019s Electronic Warfare Forecast provides coverage of self-protection and early warning systems for military platforms, both in the skies and on the surface. This service features reports on notable systems such as the Next Generation Jammer and the Eurofighter EW suite, as well as electronic intelligence gathering and radar and missile warning systems currently available or in development.

            "text": "The race to put satellites into orbit from Western Europe is heating up.\n\nJust days after a failed UK satellite launch, Sweden on Friday inaugurated its own new launch site in the Arctic, from which it hopes to see the first satellite blast off by late March 2024.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson cut the ribbon during a ceremony at the Esrange spaceport, about 40 km from the town of Kiruna.\n\nThey emphasised how the spaceport could help the EU tackle climate change and bolster its security and defence capabilities.\n\n\"This spaceport offers an independent European gateway to space,\" von der Leyen said, describing how space research had \"enormous potential\" to improve our daily life, from measuring the effects of climate change to tracking natural disasters or monitoring road traffic in real-time.\n\nSmall satellites are also important to Europe's security, von der Leyen added, noting how Ukrainian forces use them to track the movement of Russian troops.\n\n\"Europe has its foothold in space and we will keep it,\" she said.\n\nWhile 2022 has been an exceptional year for space exploration, it has been marred by growing tensions with Europe\u2019s biggest space partner, Russia.\n\nAccording to experts, it has become easier in recent years to send satellites into orbit thanks to their smaller sizes and cheaper prices compared to a few years ago - and Europe is now looking to capitalise on it.\n\nGeographical advantage\n\nAs it strikes out on a more independent path, the Esrange Space Centre has become the leading prospective candidate for Europe\u2019s first satellite launch.\n\nAlthough the European Space Agency (ESA) has a space hub in Kourou in French Guiana, there hasn\u2019t yet been a satellite sent directly from mainland Europe to space.\n\nHowever, the Swedish spaceport has said it could happen as early as the end of 2023.\n\nOther European spaceports are also in the race. Portugal's Azores, Norway's Andoya island, Spain's Andalusia and the UK's Shetland Islands are all vying for the honour of launching Europe\u2019s first satellite.\n\nThe Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) says its location, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, makes the Esrange space centre an odds-on candidate.\n\n\"We think we are clearly the most advanced,\" says Mattias Abrahamsson, Head of Business Development at the SSC.\n\nIn this area, we have 5,200 square kilometres where no one lives, so we can easily launch a rocket that flies into this area and falls down without anyone getting harmed. Mattias Abrahamsson Head of Business Development, Swedish Space Corporation\n\n\"In this area, we have 5,200 square kilometres where no one lives, so we can easily launch a rocket that flies into this area and falls down without anyone getting harmed,\" Abrahamsson says.\n\nOrbiting the North and South Poles is enough for many satellites and in Sweden, like in the rest of Europe, the rockets being developed are \"micro-rockets\".\n\nThese are around 30 metres long, and capable of carrying a payload of several hundred kilos.\n\n\"Instead of launching one big satellite, you spread it out over multiple small satellites and that drives the demand,\" Philip P\u00e5hlsson, Project Manager of New Esrange, explained.\n\nIn addition, having a launch site close to European clients spares them and their satellites long boat journeys to Kourou.\n\nThe satellite industry is booming, and the Swedish state-owned company is in discussions with several rocket makers and clients who want to put their satellites in orbit.\n\nBut working in the harsh Arctic climate \"comes with challenges,\" SSC says.\n\nWith temperatures regularly dropping to -20 or -30 degrees, special attention needs to be paid to the metals used, which become more fragile in the cold.\n\n'New Esrange' project\n\nFounded by ESA in 1966 to study the atmosphere and Northern Lights phenomenon, the Esrange space centre has invested heavily in its facilities in recent years to be able to send satellites into space.\n\nThe new hangar is big enough to house two 30-metre rockets, which are currently under assembly elsewhere.\n\nMore than 600 suborbital rockets have already been launched from this remote corner of Sweden's far north, including the Suborbital Express 3, which was launched in November.\n\nIn the future, SSC is aiming for payloads of more than a tonne.\n\nUnder a project called Themis, Esrange will also host ESA's tests of reusable rockets that can land back on Earth, similar to those used by Elon Musk's company SpaceX.\n\nFor more on this story, watch the video in the media player above.",

            "text": "Small Agency Blazes Trail For New Space Architecture\n\niStock illustration\n\nThe Space Development Agency is trying to live up to its motto \u2014 \u201cSemper Citius,\u201d or always faster \u2014 as it integrates with the Space Force and ramps up acquisition for the service.\n\n\n\nThe agency officially became part of the Space Force in October 2022. Through its acquisition strategy that prioritizes delivery speed over cost and performance, the agency is looking to transform how the service procures and fields new technologies and capabilities from the inside out.\n\n\n\nCreating change has been a focus for the Space Development Agency since its inception in March 2019, said the agency\u2019s director Derek Tournear.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were established outside of what was the Air Force \u2014 there was no Space Force back then \u2014 for one reason and one reason only, and that was to come up with a completely new way to do space architecture that disrupted the status quo,\u201d he said during a recent keynote address at the Mitchell Institute Spacepower Security Forum.\n\n\n\nThe SDA modeled itself off the book \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d by Clayton Christensen, \u201cwhich essentially says \u2026 you cannot have disruption from within, it really has to happen from outside,\u201d Tournear said.\n\n\n\nThe agency has led the Defense Department\u2019s efforts to develop the National Defense Space Architecture, or NDSA, a proliferated system of satellite constellations primarily in low-Earth orbit to provide war\u00adfighters beyond-line-of-sight targeting of mobile objects such as ships and advanced missiles in flight.\n\n\n\nDemonstrating this increased capability to track and alert soldiers to vehicles and missiles will help U.S. forces deter aggression and prevent future conflict, Tournear said.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce you can demonstrate that we have these capabilities \u2026 that will prevent war, because everyone will see that and see how rapidly we can employ those capabilities and know that if they choose to actually engage in the United States, then we will be able to defeat them,\u201d he said during a panel discussion at the Air and Space Forces Association\u2019s annual conference in National Harbor, Maryland, in September.\n\n\n\nTo put the new spacecraft in orbit as soon as possible, the SDA introduced an acquisition strategy called \u201cspiral development,\u201d fielding capabilities in two-year stages called tranches.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not going to take 10 years to field a constellation, 10 years to field a capability,\u201d Tournear said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with a minimum viable product, and we\u2019re going to field that and increase that capability every two years by hook or by crook, get those new capabilities up there.\u201d\n\n\n\nRather than wait for the best platform possible, the agency incentivized solutions that maintain the architecture\u2019s rapid fielding schedule over cost and performance, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe spiral development approach only works if you can keep that \u2026 model of delivering these capabilities on time,\u201d Tournear said. \u201cThe better product that\u2019s sitting on the ground when you go to war is not helpful. That\u2019s our unofficial motto \u2026 \u2018better is the enemy of good enough.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThis rapid acquisition strategy, with competition for contracts every other year, relies heavily on industry to continue providing the necessary capabilities, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo in a sense, I am supplementing \u2026 SDA\u2019s budget with [industry\u2019s] internal research and development dollars to make products that then you can sell back to the government,\u201d Tournear said.\n\n\n\nSpiral development was not \u201can easy concept for folks within the Pentagon to grasp,\u201d he said. SDA has faced some delays, but the agency remains committed to its approach.\n\n\n\nThe initial Tranche 0 launch was originally scheduled for September 2022, but as vendors identified challenges to the \u201caggressive delivery schedule,\u201d it was pushed to December 2022 and then again to March 2023 \u201cafter careful analysis and with input from our performers,\u201d an SDA spokesperson said in an email.\n\n\n\n\u201cSDA built in some launch flexibility to account for risks,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe anticipate all Tranche 0 satellites will be flying in time to participate in critical capability demonstrations including military exercises in summer 2023 and missile targeting demonstrations in 2024.\n\n\n\n\u201cSDA is confident our spiral development model works, while the learning process provides SDA the opportunity to grow our relationship with industry and apply Tranche 0 lessons to future tranches,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cSDA is not backing off on speed, as we still believe schedule is king.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Tranche 0 satellites were less expensive than expected, Tournear said.\n\n\n\nTournear anticipated SDA would pay as much as $25 million per satellite, but the average price for Tranche 0 satellites landed at about $14 million. They \u201ccame in below what I thought, so that [gave] a lot of people confidence,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nTranche 1 satellites \u2014 which are expected to launch in 2024 and 2025 \u2014 have cost just under $14 million per unit while increasing capability from Tranche 0, he added.\n\nAs long as the agency doesn\u2019t try to push ahead of what industry can develop, it can receive affordable price points, Tournear said.\n\n\n\nThe Space Development Agency is now part of the Space Force, which is also trying to improve upon traditional Defense Department acquisition practices. In its April 2022 report, \u201cSpace Acquisitions: Changing Environment Presents Continuing Challenges and Opportunities for DoD,\u201d the Government Accountability Office noted the creation of the Space Force \u201cwill consolidate leadership, planning, and management for selected DoD space programs.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat said, \u201cOnly time will tell if Space Force \u2026 will be able to address the long-standing concerns raised by [the Government Accountability Office] and others including historical fragmentation in space acquisition leadership,\u201d the report added.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a track record of being late on programs. We have to turn that track record around and actually execute,\u201d said Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli, who assumed the role in May.\n\n\n\nIn a memo sent to the Space Force\u2019s acquisition workforce in October, Calvelli outlined nine acquisition tenets to ensure \u201ctimely delivery of space capabilities,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\nSeveral of the tenets directly aligned with the Space Development Agency\u2019s spiral development strategy, such as building smaller satellites, maintaining stability in programs and executing and delivering capabilities that work, on schedule and on cost.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe traditional ways of doing space acquisition must be reformed in order to add speed to our acquisitions to meet our priorities,\u201d Calvelli said in the memo.\n\n\n\nAnother tenet was avoiding over-classification, which makes many programs \u201ctop secret,\u201d a problem that has hindered the delivery of space capabilities for a long time, said Gen. David \u201cDT\u201d Thompson, vice chief of space operations.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecurity remains probably one of our biggest challenges, and \u2026 while we own the ability to change it, we just have some form of bureaucratic inertia that will not let us do so,\u201d he said during a keynote address at the Mitchell Institute Spacepower Security Forum.\n\n\n\nSenior leadership in the Defense Department, including Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, is \u201cvery focused on streamlining and hopefully \u2026 normalizing that structure,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThompson went on to commend the Space Development Agency for its acquisition strategy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have found a way to use law and regulation to move out rapidly and field capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have demonstrated that [Federal Acquisition Regulation] and statute are not the problem. If we will simply empower and use them the way we should, we can do what we need to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nCalvelli also expressed his support of the SDA\u2019s spiral development method for acquisition.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am generally excited about their approach to [doing] business,\u201d Calvelli said during the AFA conference. \u201cThey are building small, they are doing things on two-year centers, and they are delivering capabilities faster. And I actually think that\u2019s a model that we can take advantage of and actually push across the organization, across the other PEOs, and something we can learn from.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the Space Force\u2019s other acquisition arms, Space Systems Command, has already taken a cue from SDA in its plans to acquire missile warning and tracking satellites for a medium-Earth orbit network, Tournear said during a media roundtable at the conference.\n\n\n\nSpace Systems Command is \u201cfollowing the model of spiral development and this two-year timeframe to get things up and operational,\u201d Tournear said.\n\n\n\nThe two-year stages, called \u201cepochs,\u201d in Space Systems Command\u2019s missile-warning constellation will be a year behind the NDSA satellites, he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got Tranche 1, Epoch 1, Tranche 2, Epoch 2 in perpetuity until we get these constellations up there and delivering to the warfighter,\u201d Tournear said.\n\n\n\nSpace Systems Command adopting spiral development shows that this acquisition strategy has \u201creally taken hold\u201d within the Space Force, he added.\n\n\n\nDespite initially wanting the Space Development Agency to remain outside of the Space Force until 2025 when the Tranche 1 satellites would all be launched, the desired \u201cdisruption actually occurred more quickly,\u201d thus allowing the agency to become part of the service in 2022, Tournear said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we were proposing to do at SDA was clearly outside, was clearly disruptive and \u2026 a lot of people were worried that we were basically proposing this and promising too much,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prevailing thought [now] is: this is the new architecture. We have to get to this proliferated architecture, and you know what, we have to get to this faster spiral development approach.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Space Force going forward is \u2026 all in on this new model. Let\u2019s push forward. Let\u2019s make SDA a success because that is the success for the Space Force,\u201d he said.\n\nTopics: Space, Acquisition, Missile Defense",

            "text": "The New Space Age Space Dodgers Space junk is a serious problem and is getting worse. In this game, you\u2019ll maneuver a spacecraft through an increasingly crowded debris field. Jump to Game\n\n(Illustrations by Ibrahim Rayintakath)\n\nShare this story\n\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, Sputnik. Since then, the space above Earth has been flooded with thousands of satellites, spent rocket stages and the debris from several catastrophic events. As a result, Earth\u2019s lower orbit has been littered with an increasing amount of junk that is careening through space at intense speeds, threatening satellites and even the International Space Station.\n\nLast year, the problem became serious enough to prompt the Biden administration to call for the abolishment of tests that destroy satellites in orbit. The announcement came after Russia blew up a dead satellite in 2021, creating a massive debris field that threatened the ISS astronauts along with other satellites.\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the future, if the international community cannot come up with a way to regulate the Wild West of space, the debris problem will get worse. Every year there are dozens of near-collisions between active satellites or pieces of debris. The more satellites that flood Earth\u2019s orbit, the greater the chances that one will happen. The more collisions, the more debris \u2014 all of which fuels what many fear could become a destructive cycle.\n\nVisualization of space debris and active satellites based on TLE data from LeoLabs fetched Jan. 9. Scale of dots represent the size of orbiting object, not to scale. Visualization of space debris and active satellites based on TLE data from LeoLabs fetched Jan. 9. Scale of dots represent the size of orbiting object, not to scale. Visualization of space debris and active satellites based on TLE data from LeoLabs fetched Jan. 9. Scale of dots represent the size of orbiting object, not to scale. Earth\u2019s lower orbit is crowded by a number of objects \u2014 including working satellites as well as space debris like defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and the detritus from missile strikes and collisions. Working satellites There are more than 6,000 active satellites rotating around Earth as of Jan. 9, according to LeoLabs, a company that tracks satellites and debris in Earth\u2019s lower orbit. Some are small, the size of a shoebox; others are much larger. Their functions vary widely, from providing television and Internet service, to GPS and weather monitoring. Defunct satellites Satellites can\u2019t live forever. They run out of fuel eventually, or malfunction and become giant pieces of garbage whizzing around the Earth. Currently, there are more than 1,800 defunct satellites in lower orbit. Under the current rules, the United States requires satellites to deorbit \u2014 or burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 after 25 years. But many think that regulation is far too lax and that satellites should be deorbited earlier. Fragments Over the years, astronauts on spacewalks have dropped a camera lens cap, a screwdriver and even a spatula \u2014 adding to the curious collection of things in orbit, which includes eroded spacecraft parts and baseball-sized chunks of garbage. Even small pieces of debris \u2014 a nut or even a fleck of paint \u2014 can cause enormous damage in space. Spent rocket stages As rockets launch to orbit, they often discard upper stages that have their own engines and propellant. If they don\u2019t burn up in the atmosphere or fall back to Earth, they join the cloud of space debris in low Earth orbit. Several of these are the size of a school bus, spinning wildly as they move through space. In total, there are nearly 1,000 spent rocket stages of varying sizes in Earth\u2019s lower orbit. The United States and private companies like LeoLabs track tens of thousands of pieces of space debris, including operational and non-operational satellites, rocket stages and unknown objects. But there are many more pieces too small to see. NASA estimates that there are roughly 500,000 objects between 1 and 10 centimeters in diameter orbiting Earth, and that there are more than 100 million particles larger than 1 millimeter. (The agency said that as of January last year, the amount of material in orbit was more than 9,000 metric tons.) And as more companies flood Earth\u2019s orbit with an increasing number of satellites, there is growing concern that collisions \u2014 which would only make more debris \u2014 are inevitable, as theorized by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978. If nothing is done, space could become so polluted that it is unsafe for human exploration and could leave some of the world\u2019s most sensitive satellites, which are used for GPS and missile warnings, at risk.\n\nDebris dodged: 0\n\nWhile space is enormous, the dangers presented by a growing debris field are significant. How would you fare at navigating an increasingly crowded environment? Give our game a try! Use your mouse to move the spaceship. If you collide with something, game over. Play\n\nDespite the growing amount of launches and space debris, there are very few rules of the road in space. While the Pentagon issues warnings about possible collisions, it cannot order one spacecraft operator to move out of the way.\n\nThankfully, there are a number of steps governments and companies are taking to curb the problem of space junk. The Biden administration has called for a ban on all destructive antisatellite tests, and recently, the Pentagon launched a program, called Orbital Prime, under the U.S. Space Force that will give companies seed money to develop the technology needed to clean up space.\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nThat includes grappling large bodies and pulling them out of orbit (one company that is working with the European Space Agency proposes using a spacecraft with large arms that would function like a Venus\u2019 flytrap), or refueling or repairing them so they can last longer and maneuver in space.\n\nTo track orbital debris, the Pentagon and commercial companies rely on a network of ground-based radar and optical telescopes. Radars can measure the distance to their targets and some can even track more than one object at a time, according to the Secure World Foundation, a think tank. Telescopes collect light reflected by debris and can cover large areas quickly and at high altitudes. The U.S. Space Force says it tracks more than 40,000 objects in space the size of a fist or larger. But there are at least 10 times as many smaller objects in orbit that the Pentagon can\u2019t reliably track.\n\nUltimately, many space officials say that cleaning up space will require foreign governments to work together.\n\nPress Enter to skip to end of carousel The New Space Age As humanity looks once again to the heavens, this series examines the recent boom of the private space industry, the long-term ambitions of NASA and foreign space agencies, and the potentially profound implications of this moment for society.

Digital understanding or fluency must be infused into all aspects of our service, not only so we can better align the global multi-domain and digitally informed nature of what we do and how we do it, but also to give us the agility needed to proactively address the growing threats we face,\u201d Rockwell stated.\n\nTo move away from legacy systems and attain the full range of benefits that come with digital technology, the Space Force has identified three key priorities.\n\nBuilding a streamlined integrated operations mission network with requisite network data connectivity is the first step, Rockwell said.\n\n\u201cOur space data networks must be bandwidth rich, secure at all levels and reliable throughout the spectrum of conflict,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nTo give warfighters decision superiority, Rockwell strives to generate asymmetric effects, which he defines as advantageous impacts of U.S. influence on adversary decision-making.\n\nFurther in the future, Rockwell aims to establish Space First, a metaverse ecosystem of multiple technology stacks connected to open standards integration intended to allow interoperable tests, trading and opposite requirements.\n\nRockwell anticipates that the platform will grow to be capable of supporting artificial intelligence and visualization layers to aid the integration of all mission functions across the Space Force.\n\nOnce the full technological foundation has been implemented, the Space Force will be able to harness the benefits of tools such as model-based systems, digital twins and real-time ranges, Rockwell said.\n\n\u201cHopefully the seeds we are planting right now will give us the ability to be a modernized digital capability. I know our priorities and our vision are laid out appropriately to the pathway for it,\u201d said Rockwell.\n\n\u201cNow it is just a matter of pulling everything together,\u201d he added.\n\nTied to the plan\u2019s success are partnerships. Rockwell is eyeing opportunities to collaborate with space-focused private sector organizations to incorporate novel technologies into the Space Force\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n\nPolicy is another major factor woven into digital modernization within the Space Force. Many current policies regarding technology were established decades ago as physical architectures were being put into place, and must be modified so that the force can fully access the advantages of modern technologies, Rockwell said.\n\n\u201cOur digital modernization efforts represent the most significant commitment to digital transformation of any government entity,\u201d Rockwell said.\n\n\u201cThe Space Force is a small, specialized service, but our domain is large, with an expansive mission that is inherently more bound to and driven by technology and digital transformation than most of our other mission sets,\u201d he stated.\n\nTo hear Rockwell\u2019s full address and register for future events, visit GovCon Wire\u2019s events page.",

            "text": "The communication market is constantly evolving. The current technological trend is moving away from the traditional broadcast business model towards a more on-demand exchange of data. With this, there is a growing demand for increased capacity and the introduction of flexibility in both connectivity and coverage. These factors necessitate more complex, flexible payloads, at higher frequency, with increased bandwidth and using more complex digital signal modulation encoding techniques. Funded by TDE , high efficiency Ka-band downlink (17.3-20.2 GHz) Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) high power amplifiers where designed, manufactured and tested to address such future needs.\n\nKa-band is now increasingly popular for high throughput fixed and mobile satellite services, offering the potential for significantly improved capability over the conventional lower frequency band allocations. High Throughput Satellites (HTS) are in operation which are characterised by multiple high-gain beams which allow closing the link with relatively small user terminals, and also frequency reuse which allows more efficient use of the available spectrum and therefore an increase in payload transmission capacity. The consequences of such satellite trends mean, however, a significant impact on payload complexity and more demanding requirements for the transmit solid-state high-power amplifier.\n\nTo reach the kind of performance required, an amplifier is needed with high power and high linearity. For spaceborne operation, high efficiency is also a key parameter due to the limited on-board prime power afforded by the fixed solar panel surface area, in addition to the limited size and mass of the thermal management system. Classical amplifiers have a maximum efficiency close to their output power saturation, however the linearity is poor at this operating point. Increasing the range of output power where the efficiency is optimal, leads to a better overall linearity performance. This is especially relevant for modern complex signal modulations which have high peak to average power ratios (PAPR) and therefore require a high output power back-off in order to maintain signal integrity.\n\nFor this scenario, the Doherty Power Amplifier (DPA) is considered a promising architectural candidate. In simple terms, each Doherty amplifier is implemented by combining the outputs of two individual sub-amplifiers; a class AB \u2018main\u2019 amplifier and in the majority of cases, a class C \u2018peaking\u2019 amplifier. The concept is to bias each amplifier so that the class C amplifier \u2018tops up\u2019 the signal when the class AB amplifier begins to go into compression. In this way the overall amplifier maintains a good level of efficiency over an extended output power back-off range (i.e. for high PAPR signals), and can also maintain a satisfactory level of signal integrity.",

Its main advantages over wind and terrestrial solar energy are the ability to deliver clean energy, day and night, throughout the year, and through all weather conditions. Interest in the technology has grown in recent years as costs fall rapidly.\n\nEarly UK investment could leverage significant private investment, and development of SBSP in the UK could provide substantial benefit to the domestic space and technology sectors, through the creation of valuable intellectual property, jobs and industrial contracts.This collaboration on space follows extensive backing for the space sector from the Business Secretary.\n\nBusiness Secretary Grant Shapps said:\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is on an ambitious journey to modernise its economy and society, which opens up a host of opportunities for burgeoning British businesses, exporting UK expertise that could transform global access to renewable energy, including space based solar power. Collaboration on a global scale is an essential part of realising the UK\u2019s ambitions in science and innovation, which is why I am excited to be here in the Gulf \u2013 where we are now playing an integral role in influencing energy transition plans \u2013 to develop our bilateral relationship with a state so open to business, and with aspirations so grand.\n\nThe UK already has strong and significant links with both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 with SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation) and Alfanar committing to investing a combined total of \u00a31.85 billion into decarbonisation and clean energy technology in Teesside.\n\nThe UK and Saudi Arabia have a long-standing bilateral relationship based on trade, investment, defence, security and energy, and we intend to maintain our relationship with the country on the grounds of vital national security and economic interests.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s \u2018Vision 2030\u2019 shows encouraging signs of change \u2013 as well as social reform and improved human rights, it is full of opportunity for the UK economy, with possibilities for space based solar collaboration being just one example.\n\nAny future funding in collaboration with Saudi Arabia will be subject to value-for-money analysis and investment security scrutiny.",

            "text": "NASA commissions 14 experimental space technology concepts Technology News | January 13, 2023 By Nick Flaherty\n\n\n\nUS space agency has commissioned 14 projects with experimental space technologies from news sensors and instruments and manufacturing techniques for habitats on Mars to power systems.\n\nThe NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program fosters innovation by funding early-stage studies to evaluate technologies that could support future missions. The latest round of awards will provide $175,000 grants to 14 researchers. Ten of the selected researchers are first-time NIAC recipients.\n\n\u201cNASA dares to make the impossible possible. That\u2019s only achievable because of the innovators, thinkers, and doers who are helping us imagine and prepare for the future of space exploration,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \u201cThe NIAC program helps give these forward-thinking scientists and engineers the tools and support they need to spur technology that will enable future NASA missions.\u201d\n\nA concept envisioned by Quinn Morley of Planet Enterprises in Gig Harbor, Washington, could investigate the chemistry of Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan.\n\nA low-cost flying boat (shown above) in Titan\u2019s low gravity could serve as a relocatable lake lander with an airborne duty cycle target of around 25%, enabling daily hour-order flights. The project is looking at an integrated, fluidics approach to aerial atmospheric science where condensation of methane and suspended complex organics can potentially be ingested through a porous or permeable aircraft leading edge, and coalesced via a passive capillary.\n\nAn experiment to demonstrate this system at a small scale in microgravity is in preliminary design stages.\n\nMary Knapp from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge proposed a new kind of space observatory comprised of thousands of identical small satellites. Precisely positioned in deep space, they could work together to detect radio emissions at low frequencies from the earliest epochs of the universe and measure magnetic fields of terrestrial exoplanets, helping identify planets outside the solar system that are rocky like Earth and Mars.\n\nCubeSat power\n\nStephen Polly with the Radioisotope Thermoradiative Cell Power Generator project will demonstrate the feasibility of a revolutionary power source for missions to the outer planets using a thermoradiative cell (TRC).\n\nThis uses a radioisotope heat source with a mass specific power of 30 W/kg and a three orders of magnitude decrease in volume down to 0.2 litres as compared to a conventional multi-mission radioisotope thermal generator (MMRTG).\n\nThis technology would allow a proliferation of small versatile spacecraft with power requirements not met by photovoltaic arrays or bulky MMRTG systems. This will directly enable small-sat missions to the outer planets as well as operations in permanent shadow such as polar lunar craters.\n\nThe study will investigate the thermodynamics and feasibility of the development of a radioisotope enabled thermoradiative power source focusing on system size, weight, power (SWaP) as well as materials growth of identified materials including InAsSb or InPSb by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. This could be used to power a cubesat (or fleet of cubesats) that can ride along with a Flagship Uranus mission, doing such tasks as serving as information relay for atmospheric probes, and getting a parallax view of the planet and moons.\n\nThe NIAC programme sits within NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and explores technically credible, early-stage aerospace concepts.\n\n\u201cThese initial Phase I NIAC studies help NASA determine whether these futuristic ideas could set the stage for future space exploration capabilities and enable amazing new missions,\u201d said Michael LaPointe, programme executive for NIAC at NASA Headquarters.\n\nwww.nasa.gov/niac\n\nShare:",

            "text": "The same technology used to search for signs of ancient life on Mars could be key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the Canadian oilsands.\n\nAt least that's what members of the Pathways Alliance \u2014 an industry consortium of this country's six largest oilsands companies \u2014 appear to believe. On Thursday, the group announced Impossible Sensing Energy, the Calgary-based affiliate of U.S. space exploration company Impossible Sensing, as the winner in an industry-sponsored global competition aimed at helping to accelerate the widescale use of steam-reducing technologies in oilsands operations.\n\nThe company won with a proposal to use optical imaging technology, adapted from its Sherloc system installed on the Mars Rover, in an oilsands application.\n\nJust as optical imaging can be used to search for faint traces of potential carbon-based past life on Mars, it can also detect precise amounts of carbon-based solvents in the oil production stream, said Ariel Torre, co-founder and CEO of Impossible Sensing Energy.\n\nHe added space exploration is not unlike the oilsands in that both operate in extremely remote environments under harsh climate conditions. Any technology that is used must be extremely sensitive but also be able to essentially work on its own, without an operator.\n\n\"A lot of the constraints that NASA has are extremely similar to the constraints oil and gas has,\" Torre said.\n\nOilsands companies currently use massive amounts of natural gas to produce steam for in situ (deep below the surface) oilsands mining. The steam loosens up the viscous bitumen enough to allow it to be pumped to the surface.\n\nWes Jickling \u2014 vice-president of technology development with COSIA, the innovation arm of Pathways Alliance \u2014 said the industry has long known that solvents, such as propane and butane, can act similarly to steam in bitumen production. If solvents could be used to replace steam in oilsands production, the amount of natural gas consumed by the industry would decline dramatically.\n\n\"We're looking at a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, all the way up to 90 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in some cases, by using these solvents. So the potential is huge,\" Jickling said.\n\nAnother potential benefit is that solvents injected with or instead of steam into oilsands reservoirs can later be recovered from the pumped bitumen and recycled to be used all over again.\n\n'Promising on paper'\n\nHowever, a report released last year by the Pembina Institute, a green energy think-tank, said solvent use in the oilsands is \"promising on paper\" but comes with technical and cost limitations.\n\n\"The economics of using solvent with steam can be challenging in low crude price cycles when the costs of deploying and recovering solvents is higher than revenues from the incremental production,\" the report said.\n\nJickling said that's why Pathways sponsored the global contest \u2014 to try to find technology that can accurately measure, in real-time, the amount of solvents recovered in oilsands production. Effectively and affordably measuring and identifying solvents for recycling, without having to deploy personnel or stop production, could be a game-changer.\n\nThe ultimate goal is for Impossible Sensing Energy to install its technology as a pilot project at a Pathways Alliance member company's oilsands site.\n\n\"This whole piece of work started because of a tough question that we needed answers to,\" Jickling said. \"This is one of the big science questions we need to solve to get this (solvent use) out and widely used across the industry.\"\n\nSolvent use is just one of the technologies the six member companies of the Pathways group are exploring as part of their pledge to reduce their collective greenhouse gas emissions from production by 22 million tonnes by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050.\n\nThe key plank in the Pathways plan is a proposed carbon capture and storage network in northern Alberta, which could see member companies invest $16.5 billion before 2030, but the group is also planning an additional $7.6 billion in spending on other initiatives such as energy efficiency, electrification of engines and more.\n\nEnvironmental groups have previously criticized Pathways for not moving fast enough with some of its proposed projects, particularly in light of last year's record-high oil prices.",

            "text": "If we ever detect an Extraterrestrial Civilization (ETC) and start communicating with them, the messages could take years, decades, or even centuries to travel back and forth.\n\nWe face a challenging 49-minute long delay just communicating with the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, and that's well within our Solar System. Communicating with an ETC that's hundreds of light-years away or even further is a daunting task.\n\nIt's even worse if we're sending probes.\n\nImagine if a robotic probe arrived in our Solar System, sent by an ETC. They detected us and sent their probe to introduce themselves and learn more about us. We would be shocked, and the event would change civilization's trajectory forever.\n\nImagine we waited for another one, and imagine that we had to wait centuries. Generations of humans would live and die, we would've learned all we could from the probe, and it would sit in a museum somewhere.\n\nAs humanity waited for the next probe, the scientific community would publish a flood of papers on the probe and what might happen next. A whole new field of study would be born. Politicians would stake entire careers on the issue, and opinion-piece writers, artists, and musicians would have a field day. Scams would appear, and cults might spring up.\n\nThen imagine our sensors detect another incoming probe from the same place as the previous one. Imagine our surprise when we receive it, retrieve it, and begin to study it, only to find that it's not as advanced as the previous one and contains older information and messages than the first one. Its technology would be less advanced, and it would be more primitive.\n\nThat's exactly what might happen, according to Graeme Smith. Smith is a professor and an astronomer at the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California. He published a paper in the International Journal of Astrobiology titled \"On the first probe to transit between two interstellar civilizations.\"\n\n\"In other words, which probes have the potential for instigating a first-contact event?\" \u2013 Graeme Smith, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California\n\nSmith points out that sending probes on journeys of such extreme distances means the first one received wouldn't be the first one that was sent. As technology advances, we can expect probes to become faster. Eventually, a probe launched later than its predecessor would overtake its predecessor and reach the destination first.\n\n\"If a space-faring civilization embarks on a program to send probes to interstellar destinations, the first probe to arrive at such a destination is not likely to be one of the earliest probes, but one of much more advanced capability,\" Smith writes.\n\n\"This conclusion is based on a scenario in which an extraterrestrial civilization (ETC) embarks upon an interstellar program during which it launches increasingly sophisticated probes whose departure speed increases as a function of time throughout the program.\"\n\nThe technological gap between probes could depend on different things, but it would be worse the greater the distance between us and the ETC. \"The more distant the site from which an ETC is launching probes, the greater will be the technology gap between a first-encounter probe and terrestrial technology.\"\n\nA lot of work has gone into calculating how widespread ETCs might be and how far they could spread after developing interstellar travel. There are all sorts of different conclusions based on all kinds of calculations and premises.\n\nOne paper examined the idea that an ETC might be able to spread through the Milky Way with self-replicating probes and that rather than using SETI to search for radio signals, we should be searching for probes.\n\nSmith's paper touches on similar themes. He focuses on a hypothetical ETC in the early stages of a probe-sending program with lots of technological advancement in its future.\n\n\"In this paper, we focus upon a hypothetical earlier phase of such an ETC in which it first embarks upon sending probes of increasing sophistication into interstellar space,\" Smith writes.\n\nThe first probe might not even be interstellar, at least not on purpose. Our own Voyager probes can rightly be called interstellar probes, though that wasn't their intent. The same could be true for an ETC just embarking on a program of sending probes to other star systems.\n\nThe first one could've been meant to explore their own solar system or the nearest star, then eventually arrived at another civilization's home. From a zoomed-out perspective, that's kind of what humanity's doing right now.\n\nThis could be how first contact happens. Rather than an overt message from sender to recipient, the recipient receives a technological artifact to ponder. In Voyager's case, both crafts carry an artifact designed for alien eyes, just in case.\n\nSmith isn't the first one to point out a technology gap in this situation. In 2006, Andrew Kennedy published a paper in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society titled \"Interstellar Travel \u2013 The Wait Calculation and the Incentive Trap of Progress\".\n\nHe pointed out that civilizations know their technology will progress, so they may wait before sending any probes, knowing that their first efforts will likely be surpassed by their subsequent, more technologically advanced efforts. Is there a point where it won't make sense to wait anymore?\n\nIn this paper, Smith assumes an ETC won't want to wait. There could be myriad reasons why, and they're beyond this paper's scope. Instead, Smith assumes an ETC launches a program without waiting until technology reaches some critical stage.\n\nHe tackles a different question: \"What probes will be the first to arrive at a disparate planetary system within which there is a civilization capable of retrieving the vehicle?\"\n\n\"In other words,\" Smith writes, \"which probes have the potential for instigating a first-contact event?\"\n\nTo examine that question, he hypothesizes two different ETCs around different stars. One has developed the capability to send probes on interstellar journeys, and Smith calls it the active ETC.\n\nThe other one hasn't developed interstellar probe technology yet but does send probes out to explore its own solar system. Smith calls this one the passive ETC. Smith examines first encounter events, where the passive ETC receives the probe from the active ETC.\n\nIn Smith's scenarios, the active ETC would continue to develop its probe technology, and the probes would become faster and faster. They would keep advancing their technology because they perceive some benefit to themselves from shorter interstellar transit times. That's how we think, so it's not unreasonable to think another technological civilization would think the same.\n\nSmith looks at two different cases of technological advancement in his paper. In the first, the speed of the probes scales linearly with the launch date. In the second, the speed scales exponentially. For each case, he looks at two examples. One for a probe sent from Earth, a passive ETC, to an active ETC. The second is for a probe sent from an active ETC to a passive ETC, Earth.\n\nIn the first case where we send probes out into interstellar space, the Voyager probes could very well be the first ones. Smith encourages enormous caution when considering this idea, but he includes it for completeness.\n\n\"The first spacecraft have begun to leave the Solar System within 100 yr of the launch of the first liquid-fuel rocket by Robert Goddard,\" Smith writes, and that forms the backdrop for this scenario.\n\nAs a loose, illustrative case, Smith calculates that a next-generation probe would launch every 100 years as Earth transitioned from a passive to an active ETC. 100 years is the same span of time between Goddard's rocket and the Voyager probes.\n\nUsing the Voyager 2 probe as humanity's generation zero probe, Smith calculates it would reach an interstellar target in our stellar neighborhood in about 80,000 years. Every 100 years, humanity would launch another probe to the same destination.\n\nIn 2,700 years, we'd launch our 27th-generation probe. That probe would be far more advanced and travel at a much higher speed. It would reach the same destination as the zero-generation probe in only 5,560 years, 74,000 years before Voyager 2 would if it were a purposeful probe.\n\nBut that example has Earth sending probes to a relatively nearby star in our own stellar neighborhood. What happens if we expand our reach for a greater likelihood of reaching an ETC and send probes to a star 31 parsecs (100 light-years) away?\n\nIn that case, our 140th-generation probe would be the first one to reach the destination. It would be launched in the 14,000th year of our interstellar probe program and would be much faster than our zero-generation probe (Voyager 2). It would reach the destination 28,200 years after the beginning of the program. And the first probe sent in this scenario wouldn't reach the same destination until a whopping 1,972,000 years later.\n\nIf this is the case, and if Voyager 2 or maybe Pioneer 11 ever made it to an ETC, they would be irrelevant. The inspiring golden record aboard Voyager 2, designed to introduce ourselves and put humanity's best foot forward, would be an anachronistic oddity.\n\nThe ETC would already know more about humanity than could be crammed into a whole spacecraft jammed full of golden records. It would be like finding a child's piece of art and showing it to them when they were 80.\n\nThe numbers for an active ETC sending probes to Earth in the same linear acceleration scenario are similar. But while our initial probes are extremely slow, a more advanced ETC would have faster probes.\n\nSmith calculates that their probes would have a speed of 1/10 light speed 200,000 years into their interstellar program. There wouldn't be an almost 2,000,000-year gap between the arrival of their generation-zero probe and their 1/10th light-speed probe.\n\nBut the first-to-arrive more advanced probe would certainly be extremely high-tech by our standards, and it's doubtful we could learn much from it. We wouldn't be able to reverse-engineer it. Indeed, we might struggle to understand its implications.\n\nThese are the linear expansion cases, where the speed of probes increases linearly. But Smith doesn't end there. He also looks at the same two cases with exponential velocity increases.\n\nIn this case, the active ETC's 6th-generation probe would be the first to arrive at the destination. It would be launched within 1,200 years from the beginning of their probe program and would reach the destination in only 200 years. So it would arrive there thousands of years before the zero-generation probe.\n\nWhatever the actual numbers could turn out to be if there were active and passive ETCs sending probes to distant star systems, a number of things are likely to be true, according to Smith.\n\nSmith agrees with other thinkers and researchers who point out that it's highly unlikely that first contact would be between two equal civilizations. There's likely to be a technological disparity between them, and it could be extraordinary.\n\nSome wonder if Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) could be probes. There's really no way to know, but the idea's worth thinking about. \"Are flight characteristics of any UAP singular enough as to be consistent with an origin from a distant ETC?\" Smith asks.\n\nWe assume that humanity would be the junior partner in any first encounter. Our level of technology doesn't allow us to send probes to other stars except the nearest. If Voyager 1 was heading for our nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, it would take over 73,000 years to get there. (Breakthrough Starshot has a concept for a fleet of lightsail spacecraft that could reach Proxima Centauri in as few as 20 years, but it's only a concept.)\n\nWe're in the predicament Kennedy outlined in his 2006 paper. It's pointless for us to try and send probes to even the closest star. We might as well wait until our technology develops. 73,000 years is an absurd amount of time. What will humanity look like by then? What will our civilization be like? Will humanity even exist?\n\nIt's far more likely that we're the passive ETC, on the receiving end of another civilization's interstellar probe program. In that case, first contact might be with an active ETC's tenth-generation probe or one even more advanced than that. What would we make of it? Would we even recognize it?\n\nIf it was designed to enter orbit around Earth or the Sun, we certainly would recognize it as an artificial object. Then what?\n\nWe'd point as many telescopes at it as we could, and then we'd launch our own probe to observe the object and learn all we could. Nations might vie for access. Things might not go smoothly. There could be arguments, and conflict could erupt as nations realize what a technological treasure trove it might be and how it might benefit them. Many nations aren't space-faring. What would all those people think?\n\nThis is all speculation, but that's part of the value of work like this. It forces us to confront these issues, even though contact might not occur for thousands of years and may never occur.\n\nBut thanks to Smith and thinkers like him, first contact by probe might play out differently. We'd be better prepared. If a probe from another ETC arrived and we retrieved it and studied it, we'd know what we might expect next. We'd know that it may not have been the first one sent, and we'd reasonably expect that the next ones to arrive might be more primitive.\n\nIn the end, it's a mind-bending concept, a kind of 'communication-by-probe relativity.' The intent behind the first probe to reach us might be wildly different from the second one, which was actually sent earlier by a civilization whose values, government, and entire understanding had changed radically in the intervening centuries.\n\nScience fiction often conceptualizes other ETCs as stolid, as if they've withstood centuries or millennia of change and development and are more stable than us. We often imagine that they're unified.\n\nMeanwhile, our own world changes radically generation by generation as technology advances and our moral thinking advances along with it. We're anything but unified. But predicting the course of events for planetary civilizations over thousands of years is impossible. We have so little to go on.\n\nIn this game of probes, our own intent would change over the centuries. We might be naive right now, imagining peaceful and fruitful first contact with another civilization, assuming they'd conquered their own dark impulses and they'd be benevolently disposed toward us. Like a big brother. But over time we might become more cautious, guarded, and even paranoid. Who knows?\n\nStephen Hawking famously warned us about advertising our presence in the galaxy too soon. \"As I grow older, I am more convinced than ever that we are not alone,\" Hawking said in the film Stephen Hawking's Favorite Places. \"One day, we might receive a signal from a planet like Gliese 832c, but we should be wary of answering back.\"\n\nGliese 832 is a red dwarf about 16 light-years away. That is an extraordinary distance, and if a probe as fast as Voyager 2 were heading there, it would take over 250,000 years to reach it. Gliese 832c is a rocky planet in the star's habitable zone, and it's the fifth-closest potentially habitable planet to Earth that we know of. If an ETC was based there, and if they sent a probe to us, they're likely to struggle with the issue Smith outlines in his paper.\n\nSomething like this might happen one day. We don't know what's out there, or how widespread life might be. But the idea that our old Voyager probes would be the first to reach another ETC, or that an ETC's first probe might be the one to reach us, is unlikely according to Smith.\n\n\"If an object sent by an interstellar ETC were to enter the Solar System, chances are it would not be a relic artifact that is perhaps analogous to a timeworn Voyager-like probe, but rather one might expect a vehicle of much greater sophistication, even if it were no longer functioning,\" Smith writes.\n\n\"This suggests a question: might a hypothetical first-encounter vehicle from an ETC be so sophisticated as to still be functioning upon arrival at the Solar System?\" Smith writes. \"As Hawking (2010) and others have drawn attention to, some potential consequences of such a first-contact event might be of serious concern for humanity.\"\n\nScience fiction writers have explored nearly every permutation and combination of these ideas, and that's as it should be according to Smith.\n\n\"This is a topic that has again found fruitful soil within the realms of\n\nscience fiction, but is beyond the context within which the present paper has been framed,\" he concludes.\n\nThis article was originally published by Universe Today.

Building on our existing successful partnerships in Australia and North America, we\u2019re delighted that our ExoSphere system is now being deployed on mineral exploration projects in Africa for the first time. Through this pioneering licensing and technology cooperation agreement, ExoSphere will give our partners at RFEG access to our Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) and real-time processing capabilities to complement their own proprietary systems. Together, we can greatly speed up the exploration process for a range of vital minerals, while also massively reducing its environmental impact \u2014 a win-win for Ghana and the wider international response to climate change.\u201d\n\nExoSphere brings a powerful new dimension to the ongoing Mineral Resource Estimate projects RFEG is conducting, in particular in the Oti Region of Ghana. Under the auspices of the Ghana Geological Survey Authority (GGSA), with implementation by RFEG\u2019s team, ExoSphere will complement RFEG\u2019s own XPLR remote-sensing mapping-analysis technology. This is achieved by cross-referencing the data from both sources, thereby significantly increasing the likelihood of finding new mineral deposits more quickly and with much greater accuracy.\n\nExoSphere\u2019s Geodes are light enough to be carried by one team member, making them ideal for use in challenging and inaccessible terrain. They are also entirely non-invasive, eliminating the need for explosives or vibrating trucks to collect subsurface seismic data. This substantially reduces costs, logistical issues and environmental disturbance; the accuracy of the combined data collection and analysis by Exosphere and RFEG\u2019s systems also means, for mining operators, that drilling can be streamlined to areas where considerable deposits are known to exist.\n\nRFEG selected Fleet Space as its technical partner after a worldwide search. The company is seeking to help current and prospective clients in the USA, Africa, Central and South America take a more tech-forward, eco-conscious approach to better ascertain site viability and increase operating efficiencies. In particular, it is focusing on using satellite-based image processing technologies analyzed by proprietary algorithms to determine a prospective site\u2019s viability before embarking on traditional geophysical work. RFEG founder Schad Brannon said, \u201cThe addition of ExoSphere 3D rendering of subsurface topography by Fleet Space propels the XPLR technology product suite and technology-stack to the next level by creating the most comprehensive satellite-based remote sensing survey product available within the mineral exploration marketplace to date\u201d.\n\nFleet Space founder Flavia Tata Nardini says, \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to see ExoSphere being deployed in Africa, and to be working in partnership with RFEG. Our two organizations have much in common: we\u2019re both looking to make mineral exploration faster and more efficient through technology; we\u2019re explorers and pioneers developing that technology ourselves; and we\u2019re absolutely committed to reducing the environmental impact of these activities, which are fundamental to economic development and climate action.\u201d",
