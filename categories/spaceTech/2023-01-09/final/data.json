            "text": "BELFAST \u2014 A collaboration between various US defense agencies, the UK government and Virgin Orbit has seen the launch of nine satellites from UK airspace today, taking off on the LauncherOne rocket from a modified Boeing 747 commercial airliner, more commonly known as Cosmic Girl.\n\nThe launch represents a number of firsts: the first time the UK has launched a rocket into orbit, the first Virgin Orbit launch from UK soil, and, most notably in Washington, the first time US military assets have been launched from the UK, albeit in cooperation with the UK Ministry of Defence.\n\nTwo of the nine satellites on board are \u201cresearch and development\u201d satellites designed to \u201cdemonstrate advanced space technologies for U.S. government agencies,\u201d the US Space Force\u2019s Space Systems Command (SSC) said in a Jan. 6 statement. Designated Space Test Program (STP)-27VP by SSC and supported by the US Naval Research Laboratory and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the project represents a step forward for the Defense Department\u2019s resilience strategy to expand the deployment of satellites from allied territories, in turn offering greater protection to US space based assets should they come under threat.\n\nSSC elaborated that STP-27VPD will \u201cdemonstrate commercially available solutions for placing USSF satellite capabilities on-orbit from a non-traditional location\u201d supporting US Space Force \u201cwarfighter requirements in an increasingly contested environment.\u201d\n\nWhile the NRO\u2019s role on today\u2019s launch was limited to acquiring launch services, the US spy agency previously collaborated with Australia on a payload launched from New Zealand using Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron rocket.\n\nCosmic Girl took off from Cornwall Spaceport at approximately 5.02 ET. Once airborne, LauncherOne will to detach from under the 747\u2019s wing and nine satellites \u2014 both civil and defense types \u2014 are headed to orbit.\n\nThe two \u201cresearch and development\u201d satellites to be used by the SSC are dual purpose, also serving the UK MoD as \u201cexperimental CubeSats\u201d called Prometheus-2. The shoe sized spacecraft will be used by London to test radio signal monitoring, including GPS and sophisticated imaging, according to a May 2022 UK MoD statement.\n\n\u201cWith horizontal and vertical space launch infrastructure, this will put the UK firmly on the map as Europe\u2019s leading small satellite launch destination, providing extraordinary potential for science, technology, security and everyday services,\u201d said Nik Smith, Regional Director UK and Europe, Lockheed Martin Space.\n\n\u201cWith Prometheus, the intention is that it will eventually be part of a larger constellation, and they [UK Space Command] will start acquiring data and start understanding how they can operate it,\u201d said Michael Holden, space advisor for Defence Security International Exhibition (DSEI), a UK based military trade show. \u201cSo everything from the launch to the operation of the satellite is kind of uncharted territory here.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Cosmic Girl launch means the UK Space Command won\u2019t have to \u201cask anyone\u2019s permission\u201d or rather rely on a foreign partner for future satellite launch operations, according to Holden.\n\nHe added that the approach for the Start Me Up mission from a defense perspective aligns with the UK\u2019s \u201cown, access, collaborate\u201d framework included in the 2022 Defence Space Strategy. The framework has been introduced to identify which sovereign space capabilities it should acquire, those that commercial companies can provide and opportunities for partnership with other countries.",

It is also in this region, where the ISS orbits and radio and GPS signals pass through, that space weather most heavily affects our technology.\n\nFluctuations in the ionosphere result in higher- and lower-density areas of ions, creating \"bubbles\" and \"blobs\" that can scatter radio signals, sometimes sending them crashing into each other in a phenomenon called scintillation. The result is noisy radio signals, which can reduce the reliability of communication and navigation systems and even block signals, according to a NASA statement about the mission.\n\n\"If you put a pencil into a glass of water that's half full, the pencil appears broken,\" Linda Habash Krause, the project scientist for SPORT at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, said in the statement. \"What happens when you have bubbles? Similar to the pencil in the water, the signals go through ample bends.\"\n\nHow these disruptive features form is not well understood. SPORT carries six instruments for measuring the ionosphere to help determine the conditions just before the formation of the plasma bubbles. The satellite will then transmit data back to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research, which will then pass on the data to researchers at NASA and other U.S. partners.\n\nMeanwhile, petitSat will work to determine what triggers plasma blobs, when they appear and how large a region they occupy.",

Based on Avalanche's latest generation of Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM) technology, this third-generation product family offers significant density, endurance, reliability, and power benefits, over existing memory solutions for aerospace and defense applications, particularly for easily configuring advanced SoCs and FPGAs, which are known to present complex design challenges.\n\nAs processing requirements rapidly increase through infrastructure modernization of defense and satellite systems, challenges associated with lagging environment-appropriate memory technologies have handicapped realizable advancement of these systems. This dynamic is heightened when configuring and supporting advanced SoCs and FPGAs for these environments such as AMD (Xilinx) Versal and UltraScale+ ACAP platforms, now approved for use in space and being widely adopted by this community for AI acceleration. Platforms like these would have historically relied on cumbersome memory subsystem partitioning using a combination of PROMs, NOR Flash and SRAM, each with its own required radiation mitigation schemes, resulting in bloated, complex, and expensive designs that extend design and qualification time.\n\nHailed by the community as the \u201csilver bullet\u201d for this \u201cboot module\u201d application, the Avalanche Gen 3 Space Grade Dual QSPI device family enables consolidation of historically complex partitioning to that of a singular device(s), capable of reliably configuring advanced FPGAs and SoCs with large image sizes and real time operating systems (RTOS), while also providing support as working memory. Layered onto the core differentiation of Avalanche\u2019s Gen 3 Space Grade P-SRAM\u2122 (Persistent SRAM) family including benchmark environmental resilience, density, endurance, power, performance, and high reliability, the Dual QSPI products offer additional tailored features to accelerate design and in situ configuration of these advanced processing platforms for maximized system performance.\n\n\u201cWith this new product family release, we are providing solutions to long-standing challenges faced by the Hi-Rel community at an unfamiliar pace of innovation\u201d, said Danny Sabour, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at Avalanche Technology. \u201cBy adding tailored interfacing and write protection schemes to a product platform that can consolidate traditional non-volatile and volatile memory functions alike, this Gen 3 Dual QSPI family offers pin compatible scalability of density and orbital classification, yielding system platforms that are SWaP-C optimized and versatile.\u201d\n\nWorking in concert with industry experts, including resources from AMD (Xilinx) to ensure robustness of the platform solution, Avalanche has rolled out key design enablement deliverables in recent weeks to accelerate evaluation, design, and prototyping of a SWaP-C optimized system implementation. These design support resources include reference designs, models, a quick start guide for booting an AMD (Xilinx) Versal FPGA/ACAP and two evaluation board options offered through distribution partner Falcon Electronics, including a plug in card that connects directly to existing VCK190 development kits via its existing Samtec connector.\n\nAvalanche Gen 3 Space Grade Serial Dual QSPI Persistent SRAM\n\nThe Gen 3 Space Grade Dual QSPI series is offered as a standard product in density options from 1Gb to 8Gb and has a serial bus interface with byte addressability with no wear leveling. Designed for High Reliability with multibit error correction and industry leading 10^16 write cycle endurance, data is always non-volatile. The devices are offered in compact 96-ball FBGA (20mm x 20mm) packages with the extended (-40\u00b0C to 125\u00b0C) operating temperature range and a JEDEC qualification flow, where every device goes through a 48-hour burn in before being shipped to customers.

If a receiver can pick up signals from multiple satellites, it can use the distance information to triangulate its location on Earth.\n\n\u201cThe [GPS] signal [that reaches the moon] is 1,000 times weaker than on Earth.\u201d Cyril Botteron\n\nThe challenge: Space agencies would love to be able to use satnav on the moon and in cislunar space (between the Earth and moon). However, while some of the networks\u2019 radio signals do pass by the edge of Earth, they\u2019re incredibly faint and hard to detect by the time they reach the moon.\n\n\u201cThe [GPS] signal [that reaches the moon] is 1,000 times weaker than on Earth,\u201d Cyril Botteron, CEO of Switzerland\u2019s Space PNT, told Space.com. \u201cOn top of that, the signal only comes from one side, whereas on Earth, you are surrounded by those satellites on all sides.\u201d\n\nThat forces them to rely on more expensive, cumbersome methods to determine the locations of objects on the moon\u2019s surface and in cislunar space \u2014 but that could soon change thanks to a pair of upcoming missions.\n\nA diagram showing the path of signals from a global navigation satellite system. Credit: NASA / Danny Baird\n\nThe LuGRE: In 2024, NASA plans to launch the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), a joint mission with the Italian Space Agency that will send a receiver capable of picking up weak signals from two major satnav networks \u2014 the US\u2019s GPS and the EU\u2019s Galileo \u2014 to the lunar surface.\n\nOnce in place, LuGRE will unfurl its antenna and \u2014 hopefully \u2014 become the first spacecraft on the lunar surface to receive signals from navigation satellites. NASA will then use data collected during the 12-day mission to develop satnav systems for future use on and around the moon.\n\nLunar Pathfinder: NASA is also working with ESA on Lunar Pathfinder, a moon orbiter set to launch in 2025 with \u201cNaviMoon,\u201d a satnav receiver being developed by Space PNT, on board.\n\nThe NaviMoon receiver and amplifier. Credit: ESA\n\nOnce the orbiter is in place, NaviMoon will use signals from GPS and Galileo satellites \u2014 as well as measurements of several forces, including the gravitational pulls of the Earth, sun, and moon \u2014 to determine its own location with an accuracy of less than 100 meters.\n\n\u201c[A]t such a distance the faint Galileo and GPS signals it makes use of will be barely distinguishable from background noise,\u201d said Javier Ventura-Traveset, head of ESA\u2019s Navigation Science Office. \u201cThis demonstration will imply a true change of paradigm for lunar orbiting navigation.\u201d\n\nProving that a NaviMoon receiver can locate itself is just the first step. The next is to have several NaviMoon-equipped satellites act like their own GPS or Galileo network for the moon \u2014 beaming signals to astronauts, rovers, and other spacecraft on its surface.\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you!

            "text": "The Transporter-6 mission successfully launched at 6:55 a.m. PT on January 3.\n\nIn January 2023, the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPP) is poised to launch into orbit a prototype, dubbed the Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD), which will test several key components of an ambitious plan to harvest solar power in space and beam the energy back to Earth.\n\nSpace solar power provides a way to tap into the practically unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space, where the energy is constantly available without being subjected to the cycles of day and night, seasons, and cloud cover.\n\nThe launch, currently slated for early January, represents a major milestone in the project and promises to make what was once science fiction a reality. When fully realized, SSPP will deploy a constellation of modular spacecraft that collect sunlight, transform it into electricity, then wirelessly transmit that electricity over long distances wherever it is needed\u2014including to places that currently have no access to reliable power.\n\nEngineers carefully lower the DOLCE portion of the Space Solar Power Demonstrator onto the Vigoride spacecraft built by Momentus.Credit: Caltech/Space Solar Power Project\n\nA Momentus Vigoride spacecraft carried aboard a SpaceX rocket on the Transporter-6 mission will carry the 50-kilogram SSPD to space. It consists of three main experiments, each tasked with testing a different key technology of the project:\n\nDOLCE (Deployable on-Orbit ultraLight Composite Experiment): A structure measuring 6 feet by 6 feet that demonstrates the architecture, packaging scheme and deployment mechanisms of the modular spacecraft that would eventually make up a kilometer-scale constellation forming a power station;\n\nALBA: A collection of 32 different types of photovoltaic (PV) cells, to enable an assessment of the types of cells that are the most effective in the punishing environment of space;\n\nMAPLE (Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment): An array of flexible lightweight microwave power transmitters with precise timing control focusing the power selectively on two different receivers to demonstrate wireless power transmission at distance in space.\n\nAn additional fourth component of SSPD is a box of electronics that interfaces with the Vigoride computer and controls the three experiments.\n\nSSPP got its start in 2011 after philanthropist Donald Bren, chairman of Irvine Company and a lifetime member of the Caltech Board of Trustees, learned about the potential for space-based solar energy manufacturing in an article in the magazine Popular Science. Intrigued by the potential for space solar power, Bren approached Caltech's then-president Jean-Lou Chameau to discuss the creation of a space-based solar power research project. In 2013, Bren and his wife, Brigitte Bren, a Caltech trustee, agreed to make the donation to fund the project. The first of the donations to Caltech (which will eventually exceed $100 million in support for the project and endowed professorships) was made that year through the Donald Bren Foundation, and the research began.\n\n\"For many years, I've dreamed about how space-based solar power could solve some of humanity's most urgent challenges,\" Bren says. \"Today, I'm thrilled to be supporting Caltech's brilliant scientists as they race to make that dream a reality.\"\n\nThe rocket will take approximately 10 minutes to reach its desired altitude. The Momentus spacecraft will then be deployed from the rocket into orbit. The Caltech team on Earth plans to start running their experiments on the SSPD within a few weeks of the launch.\n\nDOLCE unfolding\n\nSome elements of the test will be conducted quickly. \"We plan to command the deployment of DOLCE within days of getting access to SSPD from Momentus. We should know right away if DOLCE works,\" says Sergio Pellegrino, Caltech's Joyce and Kent Kresa Professor of Aerospace and Professor of Civil Engineering and co-director of SSPP. Pellegrino is also a senior research scientist at JPL, which Caltech manages for NASA.\n\nOther elements will require more time. The collection of photovoltaics will need up to six months of testing to give new insights into what types of photovoltaic technology will be best for this application. MAPLE involves a series of experiments, from an initial function verification to an evaluation of the performance of the system under different environments over time. Meanwhile, two cameras on deployable booms mounted on DOLCE and additional cameras on the electronics box will monitor the experiment's progress, and stream a feed back down to Earth. The SSPP team hopes that they will have a full assessment of the SSPD's performance within a few months of the launch.\n\nNumerous challenges remain: nothing about conducting an experiment in space\u2014from the launch to the deployment of the spacecraft to the operation of the SSPD\u2014is guaranteed. But regardless of what happens, the sheer ability to create a space-worthy prototype represents a significant achievement by the SSPP team.\n\n(L to R) Sergio Pellegrino, Harry Atwater, and Ali Hajimiri, the principal investigators of the Space Solar Power Project.Credit: Steve Babuljak for Caltech\n\n\"No matter what happens, this prototype is a major step forward,\" says Ali Hajimiri, Caltech's Bren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering and co-director of SSPP. \"It works here on Earth, and has passed the rigorous steps required of anything launched into space. There are still many risks, but having gone through the whole process has taught us valuable lessons. We believe the space experiments will provide us with plenty of additional useful information that will guide the project as we continue to move forward.\"\n\nAlthough solar cells have existed on Earth since the late 1800s and currently generate about 4 percent of the world's electricity (in addition to powering the International Space Station), everything about solar power generation and transmission needed to be rethought for use on a large scale in space. Solar panels are bulky and heavy, making them expensive to launch, and they need extensive wiring to transmit power. To overcome these challenges, the SSPP team has had to envision and create new technologies, architectures, materials, and structures for a system that is capable of the practical realization of space solar power, while being light enough to be cost-effective for bulk deployment in space, and strong enough to withstand the punishing space environment.\n\n\"DOLCE demonstrates a new architecture for solar-powered spacecraft and phased antenna arrays. It exploits the latest generation of ultrathin composite materials to achieve unprecedented packaging efficiency and flexibility. With the further advances that we have already started to work on, we anticipate applications to a variety of future space missions,\" Pellegrino says.\n\n\"The entire flexible MAPLE array, as well as its core wireless power transfer electronic chips and transmitting elements, have been designed from scratch. This wasn't made from items you can buy because they didn't even exist. This fundamental rethinking of the system from the ground up is essential to realize scalable solutions for SSPP,\" Hajimiri says.\n\nThe prototype antenna sheet for the power transmitter array that demonstrates the unit's flexibility. Each orange square on the yellow tile is an antenna to be driven by a single transmitter.Credit: Lance Hayashida/Caltech\n\nThe entire set of three prototypes within the SSPD was envisioned, designed, built, and tested by a team of about 35 individuals. \"This was accomplished with a smaller team and significantly fewer resources than what would be available in an industrial, rather than academic, setting. The highly talented team of individuals on our team has made it possible to achieve this,\" says Hajimiri.\n\nThose individuals, however\u2014a collection of graduate students, postdocs, and research scientists\u2014now represent the cutting edge in the burgeoning space solar power field. \"We're creating the next generation of space engineers,\" says SSPP researcher Harry A. Atwater, Caltech's Otis Booth Leadership Chair of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science and the Howard Hughes Professor of Applied Physics and Materials Science, and director of the Liquid Sunlight Alliance, a research institute dedicated to using sunlight to make liquid products that could be used for industrial chemicals, fuels, and building materials or products.\n\nSuccess or failure from the three testbeds will be measured in a variety of ways. The most important test for DOLCE is that the structure completely deploys from its folded-up configuration into its open configuration. For ALBA, a successful test will provide an assessment of which photovoltaic cells operate with maximum efficiency and resiliency. MAPLE's goal is to demonstrate selective free-space power transmission to different specific targets on demand.\n\n\"Many times, we asked colleagues at JPL and in the Southern California space industry for advice about the design and test procedures that are used to develop successful missions. We tried to reduce the risk of failure, even though the development of entirely new technologies is inherently a risky process,\" says Pellegrino.\n\nSSPP aims to ultimately produce a global supply of affordable, renewable, clean energy.

            "text": "New data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed that the structures of galaxies in the early universe were much more diverse and mature than previously known. Scientists compared images of hundreds of galaxies taken by JWST for the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey with corresponding images previously taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and presented the results at the 241st meeting of the American Astronomical Society.\n\nThe study examined 850 galaxies at redshifts of z three through nine, or as they were roughly 11-13 billion years ago. Associate Professor Jeyhan Kartaltepe from Rochester Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Physics and Astronomy said that JWST\u2019s ability to see faint high redshift galaxies in sharper detail than Hubble allowed the team of researchers to resolve more features and see a wide mix of galaxies, including many with mature features such as disks and spheroidal components.\n\n\u201cThere have been previous studies emphasizing that we see a lot of galaxies with disks at high redshift, which is true, but in this study we also see a lot of galaxies with other structures, such as spheroids and irregular shapes, as we do at lower redshifts,\u201d said Kartaltepe, lead author on the paper and CEERS co-investigator. \u201cThis means that even at these high redshifts, galaxies were already fairly evolved and had a wide range of structures.\u201d\n\nThe results of the study, which have been posted to ArXiv and accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal, demonstrate JWST\u2019s advances in depth, resolution, and wavelength coverage compared to Hubble. Out of the 850 galaxies used in the study that were previously identified by Hubble, 488 were reclassified with different morphologies after being shown in more detail with JWST. Kartaltepe said scientists are just beginning to reap the benefits of JWST\u2019s impressive capabilities and are excited by what forthcoming data will reveal.\n\n\u201cThis tells us that we don\u2019t yet know when the earliest galaxy structures formed,\u201d said Kartaltepe. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet seeing the very first galaxies with disks. We\u2019ll have to examine a lot more galaxies at even higher redshifts to really quantify at what point in time features like disks were able to form.\u201d\n\nThe study used an initial data set captured by CEERS when JWST first came online in June, but the survey has since captured a total of 60 observing hours, potentially providing thousands of high redshift galaxies to further explore. Kartaltepe said COSMOS-Web, the largest General Observer program selected for JWST's first year, will provide an even larger sample through 255 hours of observing time with the telescope. COSMOS-Web began its observing campaign this month.\n\nSeveral of Kartaltepe\u2019s collaborators on the study were RIT students, including astrophysical sciences and technology Ph.D. students Caitlin Rose, Brittany Vanderhoof, and Isabella Cox; imaging science Ph.D. student James Liu; and undergraduate physics student Jayse Petersen.\n\nTo read the full study, go to the ArXiv website.",

            "text": "The second half of 2022 has been tumultuous for the Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) industry. AR and VR are mediums of communication that exist on a continuum of partial to total immersion in a virtual world. To deliver these experiences, an ecosystem of hardware, developer tools and applications serving consumers and enterprises have arisen over the past several decades.AR/VR for the enterprise is emerging as its own ecosystem. In this blog, we\u2019ll unpack some of the big headlines surrounding headsets and feature several founders innovating in this space.\n\nSource: Milgram and Kishino, 1994, SVB analysis\n\nHeadsets Buried Under Headlines\n\nVR Headsets \u2013 For Gaming and Work\n\nAt least seven VR headsets are on track to release in 2023\u2014the most we\u2019ve seen since 2019. However, they will be entering a tough market. In 2022, Meta and Pico, the two large VR headset producers have struggled.\n\n\n\nMeta\u2019s shareholders reacted negatively to spending on Reality Labs (Meta\u2019s stock has declined roughly 66% year-to-date).1 It is casting a shadow on the release of the Meta Quest Pro \u2013 which is Meta\u2019s first headset marketed to the enterprise that features virtual experiences for collaboration, immersive learning and productivity tools. The $1,500 price tag sets it apart from consumer headsets which are often subsidized to gain market share and then recoup the loss with content sales.\n\n\n\nThe Meta Quest 2 VR headset for gaming has a $300 price point ($10I 0 less than the original Quest). In July 2022, Meta backtracked and increased the price by $100, citing increased costs.2\n\n\n\nPico (acquired by ByteDance in 2021 for a reported $775M)3 has also faced challenges with the release of Pico 4 Enterprise, expected to launch in 2023 priced at $900 with controllers4-- indicating the broadening of this category. Reports indicate that the company has scaled back sales targets. The consumer headset has a ticket price of roughly $425, and Pico reportedly loses $140 on each headset.5 While Pico doesn\u2019t directly compete with Meta Quest, Pico\u2019s software and content lineup is narrower in scope. Pico and Quest another gaming VR headset under Meta, sit within parent companies with core businesses outside of AR/VR; they may struggle receiving the same level of investment given challenging global economic conditions.\n\n\n\nBuilding an Industry\n\nMeta\u2019s rebrand to focus on the Metaverse has been criticized by investors after Meta missed earnings in the second and third quarters and is on track for a similar outlook for the fourth quarter 2022. The company has spent $36B on its Reality Labs division since 2019 and has committed $70B through 2026 to develop the Metaverse. (By comparison, Apple spent $3.4B in R&D between 2002 and 2007 to develop the iPhone.)6 Meta\u2019s investment strategy shows their commitment to innovation in the space. As the market continue to evolve, early strategic partnerships that lay the groundwork for enterprise AR/VR will be critical. Microsoft has teamed up with Meta to integrate Microsoft Teams with Quest devices, streaming all Microsoft apps and Xbox Cloud gaming. Microsoft will build its own virtual immersive world for industrial applications via its Industrial Metaverse Core team.7\n\n\n\nVR Headsets Under $1,5001\n\n\n\n* Price not releasd. Source: SVB analysis 1. Price reflects the lowest price at launch, may not include controllers and accessories. Not included are developer kits offered to developers for free. Details of unreleased headsets subject to change.\n\nBeyond Headsets: Uncovering the Ecosystem\n\nJust as VR headsets expand into enterprise, we see the same shift in AR. Since Google Glass debuted in 2013 to criticism over privacy, most AR headsets makers have focused on specific use cases for the enterprise. Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens AR 2 headset (released in 2019 and priced at $3,500) had the industrial segment in mind.Google has dusted off and reentered the wearable market. In 2020 Google acquired smart glasses manufacturer North and began testing smart glasses specifically for language translation. Magic Leap, which has raised nearly $4B, pivoted to the enterprise space in 2022 with the release of its $3,299 Magic Leap 2, after an underwhelming response to the Magic Leap 1 in 2018, aimed at consumers and creators. Apple\u2019s trademark and patent filings indicate they are coming to market with an AR headset in 2023.The consensus is: Whoever wins the headset, whether it\u2019s AR, VR or a mix of functionality in both, has the next smartphone. Large tech companies have been willing to spend heavily on R&D and acquisitions to be the market leader. However, headsets are only one part of the story.\n\nIn addition to headsets, most smartphones have been AR-compatible since 2017.12 Improved sensors have enabled full-body tracking in VR. Open-source developer tools (Unity and Cryengine, for example) and communities (such as Meta Open Source and Niantic Lightship) lower barriers to entry for developers. Outside of large tech companies, many entrepreneurs are building innovative companies using existing tools or developing their own, including Tilt Five, Osso VR, and 8th Wall.\n\nAR/VR Entrepreneurs Building New Realities\n\nTilt Five, founded by Valve alumna Jeri Ellsworth, has brought AR to gaming using a novel approach to optics. The system generates 3D images directly on a table using of two tiny video projectors mounted in the headset. The computer generated or smartphone images project from the glasses toward the table. A retroreflective board (made of millions of microscopic glass spheres) returns the images toward the glasses, creating a hyper realistic 3D image in front of the viewer. Tilt Five launched on Kickstarter in 2019 and raised over $1.7M. The company has partnered with established game studios and publishers around the world, and in 2022, they announced a partnership with the popular board game CATAN, which is set to launch in early 2023.\n\n\" It\u2019s been my lifelong ambition to remove the barriers to sharing video game experiences with friends and family around the table, and now the experiences are fully immersive as well! \"\n\n\n\nJeri Ellsworth, Founder and CEO, Tilt Five It\u2019s been my lifelong ambition to remove the barriers to sharing video game experiences with friends and family around the table, and now the experiences are fully immersive as well!\n\n\n\nFounded in 2016 by Justin Barad, M.D., and Matt Newport, Osso VR is a surgical training and assessment program that helps practicing surgeons, and resident surgeons gain hands-on experience simulating orthopedic surgeries and working with new medical devices. Osso VR uses off-the-shelf headsets such as the Oculus Quest 2 and develops training modules for surgeons to practice surgeries in VR. The company has raised $109M and in March 2022 raised $66M series C.\n\n\" Within VR, training has risen to the top as one of the most valuable applications, especially in healthcare. The unprecedented training gaps we are seeing in healthcare have led to a rapid adoption of immersive training with eye popping results. For example, Osso VR has six peer reviewed published clinical studies showing that it can improve performance anywhere from 230-300%. It is clear use cases with demonstrable value like this that will accelerate this exciting trend across the enterprise. \"\n\n\n\nJustin Barad, Founder and CEO, Osso VR Within VR, training has risen to the top as one of the most valuable applications, especially in healthcare.

It is clear use cases with demonstrable value like this that will accelerate this exciting trend across the enterprise.\n\n\n\n8th Wall was founded in 2016 by Erik Murphy-Chutorian and uses web-based AR to build experiential marketing campaigns. In 2018 the company launched 8th Wall Web, enabling location-based AR through a smartphone. Murphy-Chutorian essentially beat Apple ARkit and Google ARCore to market since it is cross platform and works with all browsers. 8th Wall became the go-to for major brands seeking AR activations, including Sony, NBC, Bayer, Dior, and Walmart. Web AR is primarily smartphone driven; therefore, it has the widest reach of any AR platform. In 2022 8th Wall was acquired by Niantic for an undisclosed sum. In 2021 Niantic launched its Lightship AR Development Kit which works alongside Unity. Its Visual Positioning System (VPS) allows developers to download 3D meshes and build AR experiences onto that surface.\n\n\" Mobile-based WebAR on any smartphone will be the way most people experience augmented reality for the first time. For brands, agencies and developers, the real world is their AR canvas to create and extend existing brand campaigns and create entirely new, immersive, location-based experiences that invite people around the world into the real-world metaverse. With the 8th Wall platform and tools and services we provide, AR content can exist and persist in the real-world with centimeter level precision anywhere humans can walk in public, from parks to retail locations to sporting events and community gatherings. 2023 will be the year location-based WebAR takes off beyond games across music, tourism, retail and time-based events. \"\n\n\n\nErik Murphy-Chutorian, Founder & CEO, 8th Wall Mobile-based WebAR on any smartphone will be the way most people experience augmented reality for the first time.
