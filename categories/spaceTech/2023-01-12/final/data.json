            "text": "SEATTLE \u2014 Capella Space has raised $60 million to allow the company to accelerate the deployment of its constellation and meet growing demand for its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery.\n\nThe company announced Jan. 10 it raised the growth equity financing from the U.S. Innovative Technology Fund. That fund was established last year by Thomas Tull, a billionaire former entertainment industry executive, to invest in technologies he felt critical for the country\u2019s competitiveness.\n\n\u201cTechnological competitiveness is vital to our country\u2019s future,\u201d Tull said in a statement about the investment. \u201cCapella\u2019s cutting-edge SAR technology allows us to have accurate, real-time information about what is happening on our planet, enabling decision-makers to more quickly make critical decisions about pressing geopolitical challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas is looking for companies that are dual-use: they\u2019re important for national security and governments but they also have applicability in the commercial world,\u201d said Payam Banazadeh, chief executive of Capella, in an interview Jan. 11. \u201cHe really believes in SAR and it becoming more and more important for national security.\u201d\n\nThe funding, he said, will allow the company to scale up the development and launch of the Acadia line of SAR satellites, with improved image resolution and quality, that it announced in August. He said Capella is planning \u201cmany\u201d launches of Acadia satellites this year but declined to provide a more specific estimate. It also has two more of the older Whitney class of satellites to launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing the team across all the departments \u2014 engineering, sales, marketing \u2014 to be able to move faster and cater to the demand that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to enable us to be able to pick up on the big spike of demand that\u2019s coming our way.\u201d\n\nThat demand has been driven in part by the war in Ukraine, which Banazadeh said has demonstrated the value of SAR imagery that can be collected day and night and in all weather conditions. \u201cWhat Ukraine has done is that it\u2019s shown to other customers that SAR is a critical tool,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing demand coming from everywhere, not just Ukraine.\u201d\n\nCapella has emphasized working with governments. Banazadeh said a majority of the company\u2019s business is from government customers, with a majority of that coming from U.S. government agencies. That comes from a product-market fit between what Capella\u2019s satellites can provide and the needs of government customers, an urgency those customers have for SAR imagery and supply constraints. \u201cThey want more of it. They don\u2019t have enough of it,\u201d he said of such imagery.\n\nHe said the company, whose annual revenues tripled in 2022, foresees continued strong growth from government customers, while demand from commercial customers grows at a slower pace. \u201cCommercial growth is going to lag but it\u2019s going, at some point, to pick up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just being realistic on where the commercial market is for SAR relative to the government market.\u201d\n\nThe 200-person company added about 80 to 90 people last year, Banazadeh said, and plans similar growth in 2023. He said the company has found it hard to find talented people \u201cacross the board\u201d from satellite engineering to sales but that the company\u2019s approach to hiring has worked well do far.\n\nCapella\u2019s new funding round comes less than nine months after it raised a $97 million Series C round. Banazadeh described this new funding round as \u201copportunistic\u201d given interest from U.S. Innovative Technology Fund as well as uncertainty about market in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think anyone who can raise capital in this market should, and they should probably raise more than they think they need,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a full war chest for a couple of years and making sure that you\u2019re ready for whatever that\u2019s going to come is going to be important.\u201d\n\nHe said the company would continue to look for opportunities to raise more money that allows it invest in efforts like its new satellites that can accelerate revenue growth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of capital out there that needs to be deployed in the right places. We have a lot of plans, we have a lot of a lot of things that we can do to grow even faster,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "Ibadan, 11 January 2023. \u2013 Capella Space, an American space technology company with data and satellite solutions for Government and commercial applications, announced $60 million in growth equity financing in a follow-on to their Series C funding round through Thomas Tull\u2019s US Innovation Technology Fund (USIT). Capella Space is one of the first companies to close financing through Tull\u2019s USIT Fund, bringing the Company\u2019s total funding to approximately $250M.\n\nAccording to the Company, this signals high investor demand in a callous fundraising environment. Furthermore, it reinforces the findings from the annual Space Investment Quarterly Report \u2013 specifically, how broader market space companies are disproportionately affected when it comes to financing. However, technologies like SAR are equipped to withstand these trends. The timing is also significant as the Company approaches the one-year mark of its support and visibility into the Ukraine crisis.\n\nComing off the heels of the Company\u2019s $97 million Series C financing in April, this follow-on round reflects the rapidly increasing demand for Capella\u2019s end-to-end radar-powered, high-quality SAR imagery and analytics services. Likewise, the funding will enable Capella to build and launch its next-generation Acadia satellites. This new technology offers an enhanced design to deliver higher resolution and quality, increased imaging capacity, and faster customer delivery capabilities. The Company will also expand its automated, intelligent advanced analytics offerings within the Capella Console to continue delivering the highest quality, highest resolution SAR imagery with the fastest order-to-delivery time.\n\nCommenting on the funding, Thomas Tull, Chairman of USIT, noted, \u201cCapella\u2019s cutting-edge SAR technology allows us to have accurate, real-time information about what is happening on our planet, enabling decision-makers to more quickly make critical decisions about pressing geopolitical challenges.\u201d",

In the background, is the Prichal docking module attached to the Nauka multipurpose laboratory module. Russian space corporation Roscosmos said Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2023 that it will launch a new spacecraft to take some of the International Space Station's crew back to Earth after their capsule was damaged and leaked coolant.(NASA via AP)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russia will send up a new capsule next month to bring back three space station crew members whose original ride home was damaged, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe two Russians and one American will stay several extra months at the International Space Station as a result of the capsule switch, possibly pushing their mission to close to a year, NASA and Russian space officials told reporters.\n\nCosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, and astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to return in March in the same Soyuz capsule that took them up last September. But that capsule was hit by a tiny meteoroid on Dec. 14 , creating a small hole in the exterior radiator and sending coolant spewing into space.\n\nSergei Krikalev, head of human spaceflight for the Russian Space Agency, said barring an emergency at the space station, it would be too dangerous for the crew to use that capsule to return to Earth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlthough Russian engineers believe the capsule could survive reentry and land safely, the cabin temperature could reach the low 40s Celsius (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity because it couldn\u2019t shed heat generated by a computer and other electronics, noted Krikalev, a former cosmonaut.\n\nThe new Soyuz capsule will be launched from Kazakhstan on Feb. 20, a month earlier than planned. No one will be on board; the capsule will fly in automatic mode, Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Borisov announced earlier in the day. The original plan was to launch this new Soyuz in March with two Russians and one American, replacements for the three already up there. This new crew will now have to wait until late summer or fall to fly when another capsule is ready for them.\n\nRussia will eventually bring back the damaged capsule with only science samples on board.\n\nNASA took part in all the discussions and agreed with the plan.\n\n\u201cRight now, the crew is safe on board space station,\u201d said NASA\u2019s space station program manager Joel Montalbano. \u201cThere\u2019s no immediate need for the crew to come home today.\u201d\n\nBackup plans are in the works, according to Montalbano and Krikalev, in case an emergency forces the seven space station residents to flee before the new Soyuz can be launched \u2014 like a fire or decompression. NASA is looking at the possibility of adding extra crew to the SpaceX capsule currently docked at the station.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNeither Krikalev nor Montalbano could recall a similar case in which a substitute spacecraft needed to be quickly launched.\n\nBorisov said analysis confirmed the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid, not a piece of spacecraft debris or manufacturing defect. The resulting hole was about 1 millimeter in size or less than one-tenth of an inch.\n\nMontalbano said the three crew members took the news in stride.\n\n\u201cI may have to find some more ice cream to reward them\u201d on future cargo deliveries, he told reporters.\n\nBesides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada; Russian Anna Kikina and Japan\u2019s Koichi Wakata. The four rode up on a SpaceX capsule last October.\n\n___\n\nDunn reported from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

His talk, \"Protostellar feedback in massive star-forming regions,\" will be featured in a press conference on Wednesday, Jan 11 at 10:15 AM PT.\n\nIn a previous study, Kavak and his collaborators found fossil outflows from the Trapezium Cluster of stars in Orion's Veil \u2014 a bubble of dust and gas in our galaxy \u2014suggested the veil might be breaking. Now, they've found outflows actively ejected from protostars that are not as bright as the Trapezium stars. These protostellar outflows are also interacting with the bubble's shell, allowing the researchers to study the process in more depth.\n\nAs stars from within the bubble eject material out, this material interacts with the shell. The bubble then becomes something more like a sieve, with tens of thousands of tiny holes from which gas can escape.\n\n\"Think of it like shooting a gun from thousands of different protostars, and all of them are just shooting in random directions,\" Kavak said.\n\nThis process is important for astronomers to study because of the role it plays in the dynamics of bubbles like Orion's Veil. Though they know the bubble will eventually blow up, there are many candidate mechanisms that can break it, such as radiation or hot gas from supernovae. This work provides evidence that outflows from massive protostars are a potential middle stage in the bubble's evolution that can break the bubble up earlier than expected.\n\nFurthermore, while ionized carbon has often been used to study outflows from grown stars, the results also show its utility in monitoring the outflows of a star even before it is fully formed, and their impact. However, the Veil is difficult to study because of how thin and dense it is, and its structures can only be traced with ionized carbon observations. SOFIA was therefore unique in its ability to reveal this interaction, thanks to its spectral resolution and its ability to resolve the ionized carbon around protostars.\n\n\"There's no way to study this anymore without SOFIA,\" Kavak said. \"We may trace structures perpendicular to our line of sight with other observations, but if the structure illuminated by a massive star is moving towards us, velocity-resolved ionized carbon observations are one-of-a-kind.\"\n\nAbout SOFIA\n\nSOFIA was a joint project of NASA and the German Space Agency at DLR. DLR provided the telescope, scheduled aircraft maintenance, and other support for the mission. NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley managed the SOFIA program, science, and mission operations in cooperation with the Universities Space Research Association, headquartered in Columbia, Maryland, and the German SOFIA Institute at the University of Stuttgart. The aircraft was maintained and operated by NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center Building 703, in Palmdale, California. SOFIA achieved full operational capability in 2014 and concluded its final science flight on Sept. 29, 2022.\n\nAbout USRA\n\nThe Universities Space Research Association (USRA) is a nonprofit corporation chartered to advance space-and aeronautics -related science, technology and engineering.

This process is important to study because it can affect predicted timelines for when such bubbles will blow up, and ionized carbon observations from SOFIA were necessary to trace this interaction."

Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight The replacement craft, which will have no crew aboard, is to be launched Feb. 20 to pick up Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin as well as NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who all arrived at the station in September.\n\nOn Dec. 14, as the cosmonauts were preparing to leave the station\u2019s airlock to perform a spacewalk, ground controllers noticed a leak of coolant spraying uncontrollably into space. Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, immediately canceled the spacewalk and determined that the leak was coming from a tiny hole in an external cooling line, about one millimeter wide. The coolant is used to keep the capsule at a comfortable temperature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Roscosmos, in cooperation with NASA, had been trying to determine whether the spacecraft was fit to fly the crew home or if the agency needed to send up a rescue craft. The teams determined that without the coolant, temperatures inside the spacecraft could exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The high temperature combined with humidity could affect the spacecraft\u2019s computing systems and also make the atmosphere uncomfortable for the crew.\n\nAfter the new spacecraft arrives at the station, Roscosmos plans to fly, without crew members, the damaged Soyuz back to Earth, where it will be retrieved and inspected.\n\nNASA and Roscosmos have said that the crew members on the station are not in danger and that they continued to conduct research and science experiments, including growing tomatoes, while crews on the ground developed a solution for the problem. Seven people are aboard the station: the three who flew on the Soyuz craft in September and four who flew to the station in October on SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft, which also is docked at the station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a call with reporters Wednesday, NASA\u2019s space station program manager, Joel Montalbano, sought to downplay the severity of the issue, saying there is \u201cno immediate need for the crew to come home today.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from Moscow, where he was involved in meetings with Roscosmos officials, Montalbano said NASA was not \u201ccalling it a rescue Soyuz. \u2026 I\u2019m calling it a replacement Soyuz.\u201d\n\nSergei Krikalev, executive director of Roscosmos\u2019s human spaceflight programs, said the agencies prepare for this sort of situation, knowing they are extremely rare. \u201cThis is a scenario we envision, and now we are basically following the procedure,\u201d he said.\n\nKrikalev said it was \u201cthe first time I remember\u201d having to send a replacement spacecraft to the station. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had the real need to do this\u201d he said.\n\nNASA and Roscosmos are examining options in the event of an emergency that would require the crews to evacuate the station before the rescue Soyuz arrives. The Soyuz crew could still board its spacecraft and use it as a lifeboat, without returning to Earth\u2019s atmosphere. It also might be possible to fit an additional crew member in the SpaceX Dragon capsule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plan now would involve crews going \u201cin your respective vehicles today,\u201d Montalbano said. \u201cBut, in parallel, we have been talking to SpaceX and looking at an option of what we can do with the SpaceX vehicle.\u201d\n\nHe said NASA officials concurred with Roscosmos\u2019s view that the damage to the Soyuz vehicle docked at the space station was probably caused by a micrometeoroid. He said there was nothing abnormal \u201cin the manufacturing of this vehicle.\u201d Earth\u2019s orbit also has been flooded with debris from a Russian missile strike on a dead satellite in 2021 that, at the time, required crews on the space station to shelter in their spacecraft.\n\nOverall, Montalbano said, NASA and Roscosmos \u201chave worked extremely well together, both the technical teams and the management team. It is a true testament to the partnership.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a fresh Soyuz at the station, Krikalev said, the three-member crew\u2019s mission would be extended by a number of months. It\u2019s not clear, though, how the launch of the replacement vehicle would affect NASA\u2019s schedule. For now, SpaceX is expected to fly another crew of astronauts to the station in February. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a couple more weeks before we\u2019re ready to define a bunch of new launch dates,\u201d Montalbano said.\n\nCrew members on the space station were in good spirits and continuing to go about their business, he said. But he added: \u201cI may have to fly some more ice cream up to reward them.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "Launch startup ABL Space Systems\u2019 first orbital launch attempt ended in failure Tuesday after all nine engines on the RS1 rocket\u2019s first stage shut down simultaneously. The rocket subsequently hit the launch pad and was destroyed on impact.\n\nThe rocket took off from the Pacific Spaceport Complex on Alaska\u2019s Kodiak Island at around 6:27 PM EST. It\u2019s unclear how soon after lift-off the engines failed. The rocket was carrying a technology demonstration CubeSat for data analytics company OmniTeq. While the payload was lost, no personnel were injured by the rocket impact.\n\nAs is customary with anomalous rocket launches, the company is working with officials from the spaceport and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the cause of the engine shutdown.\n\nABL President Dan Piemont told TechCrunch that while the investigation is still in its early stages, \u201cThe simultaneity of the shutdown is a strong piece of evidence but it will take more time for the team to narrow down contributing factors and a root cause.\u201d\n\nABL\u2019s 88-foot-tall expendable rocket RS1 is capable of carrying up to 1,350 kilograms to low Earth orbit, similar to Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Alpha vehicle. The company has previously said that each launch would cost around $12 million, putting it in a growing field of competitors looking to provide rapid launch services at low cost.\n\nThe failure on Tuesday comes just one day after a Virgin Orbit mission experienced its own anomaly, which ended the mission prematurely. Two other rockets also experienced failures in the past month: Arianespace\u2019s Vega-C and Chinese company Landspace\u2019s Zhuque-2, which would\u2019ve been the first methane-fueled rocket to reach orbit.\n\nABL has raised $420 million since its founding in 2017, including a $200 million Series B extension round in December 2021 at a valuation of $2.4 billion. Its investors include Lockheed Martin, which purchased a block of up to 58 launches from the startup last April.\n\n\u201cThe Flight 2 vehicle is fully assembled and ready to begin it\u2019s flight campaign, so we\u2019re champing at the bit to get going on that as soon as the Flight 1 investigation is complete,\u201d Piemont said.",

            "text": "The astronaut Katya Echazarreta in Mexico City. Gladys Serrano\n\nShe walks out of the Senate in a designer suit and heels, escorted by her team, which includes her mother and brother. She is asked to take a photo or a video for a fan and she smiles; her Saturn earrings sparkle in the sun as she poses for pictures as if she has been doing this her entire life. There\u2019s a new star walking down Mexico City\u2019s Paseo de la Reforma, but she\u2019s not an actress or a singer; she\u2019s an astronaut.\n\nKatya Echazarreta, a 27-year-old native of Guadalajara, Mexico, first stepped into the spotlight just a few months ago when she became the first Mexican national to go into space, as well as the youngest woman to do so. Out of 7,000 candidates, this NASA engineer was chosen by the Space for Humanity organization to participate in a 10-minute flight beyond the Earth\u2019s frontier. While that accomplishment could have been the endpoint, Katya has loftier goals. Now, she has left her job at the US space agency to work for Mexico\u2019s. What does her future hold? \u201cI definitely want to go back into space, I want to go to the Moon, but I want to go there with Mexico,\u201d she says; Katya speaks so confidently that it seems possible.\n\nEchazarreta\u2019s story is an improbable one. At the age of seven, she moved with her family from Guadalajara to San Diego. Her sister had suffered from a bout of meningitis, which left her paralyzed, and the family could not find a suitable school for her in Guadalajara, so they crossed the border. Echazarreta remembers the difficulty of her early years in the United States: \u201cOf course the children make fun of you. They don\u2019t let you into their cliques, especially because you can\u2019t communicate; you don\u2019t speak the language.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, she decided to study electrical engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. She mentions the exact year because it coincided with the moment when NASA stopped the shuttle program that took crew members into space. \u201cWhen they shut it down, no one knew what the agency\u2019s future would be; we didn\u2019t know if we were going to continue going to the Moon. At the time, the dreams that we currently have for the space industry didn\u2019t seem possible,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided that was what I wanted to do; that if NASA was only going to hire five people, I was going to be one of those five.\u201d\n\nHer dream became a reality a few years later when she joined the US agency as a fellow, and then she was hired for a permanent position. During that time, she participated in five missions, including the Perseverance robot, which pioneered explorations of Mars. Katya\u2019s strengths as an engineer are her willingness to take on new challenges and her perseverance: \u201cI was offered a project [to do] something I had never done before, and I said, \u2018let me do it.\u2019 [Doing] that helped me reach important positions in my first year as an engineer.\u201d\n\nA male-dominated space\n\nThe space race has always been a male-dominated environment. In 1960, sexism led NASA to cancel its female astronaut program; women outperformed the men on tests but were excluded all the same. It was not until 2013 that NASA promoted parity. In Europe, there is currently only one active female cosmonaut. Even now, 50 years after Apollo 17 landed on the Moon, the world is still waiting for a woman to step on that celestial body for the first time. This was the context in which Katya Echazarreta, then 26 years old, went into space.\n\nIn June, Katya flew with five other crew members on a Blue Origin rocket, the company owned by Amazon magnate Jeff Bezos, in an experiment that aims to enable citizens to reach space and change their perspective. She successfully completed a grueling training program and was chosen ahead of 7,000 others. She was fulfilling the promise she made to herself at the age of seven, when she was already obsessed with space. But then she was told that she was taking the spot away from a man \u201cwho deserved it.\u201d She replied calmly: \u201cYou can\u2019t take something away from another person if it\u2019s theirs, and going to space was always mine.\u201d\n\nAfter that, she graced magazine covers and received messages from dozens of girls who wanted to be like her. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see,\u201d she says about the importance of representation. She did all of this without changing who she was. \u201cI\u2019m not changing my femininity to attain such a position. I\u2019m putting out a version of a woman who is indeed an engineer, who is interested in science, and who doesn\u2019t conform to the stereotypes of what an engineer should look like,\u201d she says, and, indeed, it is easy to see how her glittery eyeshadow is applied perfectly on her eyelids. \u201cI think I\u2019ve spent my life breaking stereotypes. Ever since I was a child, I\u2019ve always been a very strong person. My mom always encouraged me and told me: \u2018You can do whatever you want to do,\u2019\u201d she notes. Without hesitating, she confidently goes on to say: \u201cI\u2019ve achieved everything I\u2019ve wanted, and I\u2019ve put in the time.\u201d\n\nWith that indefatigable determination, Katya is now navigating the corridors of the Mexican Senate and Congress, where she is trying to convince legislators to change Articles 28 and 73 of the Constitution to give the Mexican space industry additional resources. In a daring move, Echazarreta walked away from a promising future at NASA to help take her country to space. \u201cI could have moved up [in the ranks], grown as an engineer, [and] eventually applied for an American astronaut program. Of course, it would have been a lot easier that way, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me because I understand that my country lacks those opportunities. I want to create those opportunities in Mexico,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Mexican space industry is weak and dependent on its giant neighbor to the north. For example, for 2020, NASA received around $22.6 billion; China\u2019s space agency had a budget of about $11 billion; the European Space Agency has almost $8 billion to spend; and the Mexican space agency, which was created only 10 years ago, received $3 billion. There is no way to compete, which is why the idea of a Latin American space agency was considered a couple of years ago. In addition, Echazarreta points out that Mexico is awarding space projects to foreign companies rather than its own, because the former already have the infrastructure. \u201cThey see it as much easier [that way], but what they don\u2019t realize is that they are spending a lot more to pay another country that doesn\u2019t even consider us to be a priority [and] gives us the information we are buying as their last option; [instead,] we could invest in our own industry, in our own companies, in Mexican people developing space technology, and in the long term it will be easier, cheaper, and it will be ours,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe young woman wants to take advantage of her current visibility to keep her eyes on the prize: Mexico\u2019s opportunity is now; otherwise, there will be no way to join the space race. \u201cI want to help Mexico become an international player in the space industry,\u201d she explains. The mission to take people back to the Moon is planned for 2025. Half a century after the first Moon landing, six world powers have all set the same goal for themselves: to display their technological might, explore the Moon\u2019s enormous mineral reserves and set up a base there as an intermediate station en route to the ultimate destination, Mars.\n\n\u201cSpace is no longer something in the future; it\u2019s already here. In the next 10 years, we will be able to be in space. We will need people with different types of specialized knowledge, not just scientists or engineers,\u201d warning that \u201cif Mexico does not start to promote space issues now, it will be left behind.\u201d To help the country become a player in space exploration, the astronaut is setting up a foundation to financially support Mexican students and companies that want to train, create technology or research topics related to space development. She plans to get the funds for this venture from larger companies that are interested in seeing Mexico develop these capabilities. The Mexican Space Agency has already announced that it will collaborate with Echazarreta. \u201cI would love to see a mission to space by Mexicans, [with people] selected and trained in Mexico\u2026[so] that we no longer have to ask others for information or wait for them to give us something\u2026and I want to be the person who promotes that,\u201d she says. \u201cI see my future as the future of space in Mexico.\u201d",

The goal was planetary defense \u2014 protecting our planet from the kind of wayward rock that could end civilization as we know it. The unprecedented moment seemed surreal, with a camera from the craft sending footage back to Earth of a large asteroid getting bigger and bigger until \u2014 pow! \u2014 impact. It was both incredible and credible \u2014 equal parts jaw-dropping and successful in its proof of concept.\n\nWho could have imagined such a thing?\n\nWell, science fiction writers did.\n\n\u201cCrashing big things into celestial objects goes all the way back to the 1930s stories of Edmond \u2018World Wrecker\u2019 Hamilton,\u201d Lisa Yaszek, regents professor of science fiction studies at Georgia Tech, wrote in a text message. \u201cIn \u2018Thundering Worlds,\u2019 we throw Mercury at an invading alien army to save the rest of the solar system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpace exploration is in a renaissance, as the private space industry takes on a growing presence in the United States, and as the space agencies of several countries have joined NASA in setting their sights on the moon and other deep-space goals. But like stars that sent their light long before Earth could see it, science fiction creators helped inspire this wave of interest decades ago.\n\n\u201cWe may envision the outcome we want to achieve through the imagination and inspiration of our team members, or we may be inspired by concepts found in the art,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Barbara Brown, director of exploration research and technology programs. \u201cAnd then science, engineering and math drive the rest.\u201d\n\nSpace moguls like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson and Paul Allen have credited their interest in the final frontier to several written and filmed works. And that doesn\u2019t include the NASA visionaries who love sci-fi.\n\nPress Enter to skip to end of carousel The New Space Age As humanity looks once again to the heavens, this series examines the recent boom of the private space industry, the long-term ambitions of NASA and foreign space agencies, and the potentially profound implications of this moment for society. Read the section. End of carousel\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a wall of autographs from Star Wars actors and actresses, and this year I got an autograph from William Shatner,\u201d said Tracy Gill, deputy manager for lander ground operations in NASA\u2019s Human Landing System Program. \u201cI go to Comic-Con. I\u2019m down in deep.\u201d\n\nMark Wiese, manager for NASA\u2019s Deep Space Logistics project, grew up with \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and now spends his mornings watching \u201cThe Expanse\u201d while working out on his rowing machine.\n\n\u201cBeyond creating a climate where innovative thinking is acceptable,\u201d said Chris McKitterick, who directs the Ad Astra Center for Science Fiction and the Speculative Imagination at the University of Kansas, \u201cscience fiction has influenced countless scientists, engineers and technologists to make real the things depicted in science fiction narratives.\u201d\n\nBased on a canvassing of experts ranging from the Kennedy Space Center to academia, here is a brief tour of the sci-fi works that were most influential in helping to pave a real-life path to the stars:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Star Trek\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine space \u2014 or even the future itself \u2014 without thinking of \u201cStar Trek.\u201d The original 1960s series inspired early designs for everything from desktop computers to cellphones to Zoom. Bezos even fashioned Amazon\u2019s Alexa based on the shipboard computer of the Starship Enterprise and named one of his holding companies \u201cZefram LLC\u201d after the \u201cStar Trek\u201d character who invented the warp drive.\n\nRonald D. Moore, a screenwriter and producer who worked on \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d beginning in 1988, took a tour of the SpaceX craft and couldn\u2019t help but see the influence of the iconic series. \u201cYou get used to certain ideas for what a spaceship looks like, and it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by the things you\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Moore, who is the creator of the Apple space series \u201cFor All Mankind.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of ways you can lay out controls, but they had chosen a black and white, high contrast, sleek design that could have been on any Hollywood set in the last 40 years.\u201d\n\nBut there are more layers of influence. Moore, who said he watched the original \u201cStar Trek\u201d series five days a week growing up in the 1970s, was moved by the noble optimism of the series. \u201cIt was one of the very few scientific shows that says the future is going to turn out okay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to solve poverty and racism and disease. I\u2019m inspired by the hope these problems are temporary setbacks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Heinlein\u2019s writings\n\nHeinlein was a revolution unto himself. He relied on science and engineering to imagine brave new worlds, he overlaid timeless human traits into a futuristic setting, and he came up with protagonists Yaszek refers to as \u201ccreative capitalists,\u201d who leveraged private industry and navigated government oversight to chase space glory. Sound familiar?\n\nIn \u201cThe Man Who Sold the Moon,\u201d central character D.D. Harriman \u201ccreates a coalition of corporations, governments, and media to create the first viable space company,\u201d Yaszek wrote in an email, \u201cand, not coincidentally, to secure the moon as his own private resource, free of government interference.\u201d Heinlein also contributed to the screenplay of the 1950 film \u201cDestination Moon,\u201d which imagined a manned trip to the lunar surface \u2014 less than 20 years before the real thing happened.\n\nHeinlein\u2019s attention to not only space travel, but also the cooperation between the public and private sectors, lived on long after him. He devoted a portion of his estate to creating the Heinlein Prize for accomplishments in commercial space \u2014 won by Musk and Bezos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation series\n\nAsimov\u2019s famous Foundation trilogy, written in the 1940s, centers on a mathematician who figures out a way to stave off the fall of a decaying empire. Part of Asimov\u2019s legacy \u2014 and the genre\u2019s legacy \u2014 is not just imagining a landscape somewhere out there, but also putting humans in a setting where they can potentially solve future problems. It\u2019s a call to action that spoke to Musk and Bezos. Asimov had so much impact on Musk that he put a copy of the series into a Tesla roadster that was sent into orbit.\n\nAsimov and Heinlein are considered by many to be among the \u201cBig Three\u201d of science fiction writing, along with Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who co-wrote the screenplay for \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which was based on Clarke\u2019s novel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The Martian\u2019\n\nAndy Weir\u2019s tale of an astronaut stranded on Mars, which he first published on his own website, takes a unique place in sci-fi history. \u201cThe Martian\u201d not only spawned a movie starring Matt Damon, it also boosted interest in NASA and ignited a new wonder about visiting the Red Planet. It was a new twist on an old story: A daring sci-fi plotline nourishes ideas about what we can do in real life. NASA\u2019s Gill said he is asked about the film whenever he visits schools.\n\n\u201cThey tried to grow their own food, which is something we\u2019re working on,\u201d Gill said. \u201cIt would be considered sci-fi, but it\u2019s really something that we\u2019re going for.\u201d\n\nThe connection between science fiction and real-life spaceflight has cut both ways. Moore fondly recalls when he was working on the \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d series and NASA reached out. One of their astronauts wanted to call \u2026 from the space station. He was a fan of the show. \u201cIt blew my mind,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe was watching fake space on his laptop while real space is outside his window.\u201d That astronaut, Garrett Reisman, became a key contributor to \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d which imagines an alternate space history in which the Soviet Union beats the United States to the moon.\n\nAs space exploration has found new reverence, so has sci-fi itself. Fighting orbital threats is now a real-life exercise, and eye-rolling has given way to respect. \u201cIt\u2019s always been viewed as kid stuff or not taken seriously,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s always had a second-class status. Sci-fi and fantasy always get pushed to the margins. I\u2019ve seen in the last 20 years they\u2019ve gotten more acclaim, more critical response.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve also become more diverse. Voices like those of Mary Robinette Kowal \u2014 author of the award-winning alt-history novel \u201cCalculating Stars\u201d \u2014 and Ted Chiang have grown the sci-fi oeuvre over the past several years. And just as space travel ambitions have spread to other countries, a number of international authors have emerged among science fiction\u2019s elite. For example, Chinese novelist Liu Cixin\u2019s \u201cThe Three-Body Problem\u201d has sold more than 8 million copies, is being adapted into a Netflix series and drew President Barack Obama\u2019s praise after he read it during his time in the White House. \u201cThe scope of it was immense,\u201d Obama said in 2017.\n\nIndeed, it seems the possibilities for space and sci-fi are now as limitless as ever. As Asimov himself said, \u201cScience fiction writers and readers didn\u2019t put a man on the moon all by themselves, but they created a climate of opinion in which the goal of putting a man on the moon became acceptable.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "Researchers have developed a way to use laser light to pull a macroscopic object. Although microscopic optical tractor beams have been demonstrated before, this is one of the first times that laser pulling has been used on larger objects.\n\nLight contains both energy and momentum that can be used for various types of optical manipulation such as levitation and rotation. Optical tweezers, for example, are commonly used scientific instruments that use laser light to hold and manipulate tiny objects such as atoms or cells. For the last ten years, scientists have been working on a new type of optical manipulation: using laser light to create an optical tractor beam that could pull objects.\n\n\"In previous studies, the light pulling force was too small to pull a macroscopical object,\" said research team member Lei Wang from QingDao University of Science and Technology in China. \"With our new approach, the light pulling force has a much larger amplitude. In fact, it is more than three orders of magnitudes larger than the light pressure used to drive a solar sail, which uses the momentum of photons to exert a small pushing force.\"\n\nIn the Optica Publishing Group journal Optics Express, Wang and colleagues demonstrate that macroscopic graphene-SiO 2 composite objects they designed can be used for laser pulling in a rarefied gas environment. This type of environment has a pressure much lower than atmospheric pressure.\n\n\"Our technique provides a non-contact and long-distance pulling approach, which may be useful for various scientific experiments,\" said Wang. \"The rarefied gas environment we used to demonstrate the technique is similar to what is found on Mars. Therefore, it might have the potential for one day manipulating vehicles or aircraft on Mars.\"\n\nCreating enough force\n\nIn the new work, the researchers designed a special graphene-SiO 2 composite structure specifically for laser pulling. When irradiated with a laser, the structure creates a reversed temperature difference, meaning that the side facing away from the laser gets hotter.\n\nWhen objects made from the graphene-SiO 2 composite structure are irradiated by a laser beam, gas molecules on their back side receive more energy and push the object toward the light source. Combining this with the low air pressure of a rarified gas environment allowed the researchers to obtain a laser pulling force strong enough to move macroscopic objects.\n\nUsing a torsional -- or turning -- pendulum device made from their graphene-SiO 2 composite structure, the researchers demonstrated the laser pulling phenomenon in a way that was visible to the naked eye. They then used a traditional gravity pendulum to quantitatively measure the laser pulling force. Both devices were about five centimeters long.\n\nRepeatable, tunable pulling\n\n\"We found that the pulling force was more than three orders of magnitudes larger than the light pressure,\" said Wang. \"In addition, the laser pulling is repeatable, and the force can be tuned by changing the laser power.\"\n\nThe researchers caution that this work is only a proof of concept and that many aspects of the technique would need improving before it would be practical. For example, a systematic theoretical model is needed to accurately predict the laser pulling force for given parameters including the geometry of object, laser energy and the surrounding media. They would also like to improve the laser pulling strategy so that it can work for a wider range of air pressures.\n\n\"Our work demonstrates that flexible light manipulation of a macroscopical object is feasible when the interactions between the light, object and medium are carefully controlled,\" said Wang. \"It also shows the complexity of laser-matter interactions and that many phenomena are far from being understood on both on macro and micro scales.\"",

            "text": "As NASA gears up for more Artemis missions, which will send astronauts to the moon and then to Mars, the agency\u2019s Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche stated it is \u201cvery realistic\u201d that humans will be on Mars in the next 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe program that NASA has is moon to Mars, and so that is definitely what our goal is\u2014to get to Mars,\u201d Wyche said at a Washington Post Live event on Tuesday.\n\nShe noted that the agency\u2019s Artemis missions will help NASA learn what is needed for further space exploration and for longer-duration missions. Moreover, NASA is looking at the moon as a test bed for further space exploration.\n\nThe first mission under the Artemis program was an uncrewed flight, and the agency used it to test systems\u2014making sure they could survive the environments and journey in and out of space\u2014and learn for future missions, according to Wyche.\n\n\u201cOne of the large things for us to learn was how the heat shield would perform, making sure that we could actually reenter into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\u201d Wyche said.\n\nShe indicated that a \u201cbig surprise was how flawlessly everything worked,\u201d once the spacecraft actually took off.\n\nNow, NASA will continue to conduct post-flight testing and instrumentation\u2014or looking at the spacecraft during its journey and return. The agency will also examine technology like the heat shield\u2014which protects the spacecraft during its reentry of Earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014to ensure there are no issues or concerns.\n\nArtemis II, which will return humans to the moon, is expected to launch by the end of 2024.\n\nIt is important to explore the moon, Mars and space because of the scientific knowledge that can come from it, according to Wyche.\n\nA journey to the moon takes about three to six days, a much shorter endeavor in comparison to the several months required to travel to Mars. As a result, Wyche indicated that using more thorough exploration of the moon to test space technologies will be beneficial for space exploration to places further away like Mars.\n\n\u201cWe went to one particular area of the moon,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not gone to every area of the moon, so, with Artemis, we\u2019re going to go to the polar regions.\u201d\n\nThe lunar ice and \u201cother volatiles\u201d located in those regions could potentially be used to make propellant or fresh oxygen, according to Wyche, expanding humans\u2019 knowledge of how to live on another planetary body.\n\n\u201cThose are the things that we need to know in order to go further into the solar system\u2014so to go to Mars\u2014or go even further than that,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Wyche stated that there are technology gaps that the agency is trying to study to allow for longer-duration missions. Wyche noted that NASA is utilizing the International Space Station to help with some of these studies.\n\n\u201cFrom a technology standpoint, how do we make sure that our crews have all of the proper water? How do they have the proper environments for when they\u2019re on these long duration journeys? One of the things that we do on the International Space Station is reclamation of water. So, we\u2019re not able to carry all of the water that we\u2019re going to need to go on a very long journey. And so, we\u2019ll need to be able to reclaim the water that the crews use during their activities. We have technology that we\u2019ve been using to do that,\u201d Wyche said.\n\nTechnological limitations\u2014such as time delays in communications between Earth and Mars\u2014also necessitate humans being on Mars missions, according to Wyche.\n\n\u201cHuman robotic operations working together will allow us to actually do further excavations,\u201d Wyche said. \u201c[It] will allow us to be able to use the human to assist robot[s] and mak[e] decisions, finding and doing discoveries.\u201d\n\nThere could even be a permanent base on the moon one day. Wyche noted that the Johnson Space Center is looking at creating the Gateway\u2014a small habitat in lunar orbit\u2014to use as a jumping off point for lunar and space exploration, as well as to use as a home base for studies.",

READ MORE\n\nAstronauts on the International Space Station can\u2019t just clean their environment the way people do on Earth; NASA can\u2019t just send them a bottle of bleach. Keeping their environment free of contamination requires testing constantly. This process used to take six to eight weeks and involve sending fully-cultured petri dishes back down to Earth for analysis, but that changed in 2016 when NASA sent them their own DNA sequencer. After that, only the data had to be sent back down, drastically shortening the time to results. Now, NASA is looking at edge computing as a means to shorten that sample-to-answer time once again.\n\nSarah Wallace, a microbiologist at Johnson Space Center, said the whole process currently takes five to seven days, with two or three days devoted to actually sending down the data. But with edge computing, that timeframe can be further shaved down to as little as 24 hours. And while that\u2019s important to the astronauts on the ISS, it will be absolutely crucial to NASA\u2019s future plans for space exploration.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about ISS, we really have a nonexistent lag time in our communications,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut as we think about [Lunar] Gateway, physical locations on the lunar surface, that may or may not be the case. And obviously, with Mars, that\u2019s not going to be the case. So our goal has always been how do we get the crew an answer without having them be these bioinformatics experts?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important, because DNA sequencing is complicated work; each sample generates close to half a terabyte of data. So NASA worked with private sector partners to containerize the code and run it on the Spaceborne Computer-2 (SBC-2), an experimental, proof of concept system designed to test the viability of commercial-off-the-shelf hardware in space, and provide edge computing and artificial intelligence capabilities to the ISS.\n\nThe main challenge is keeping the code updated and ensuring it\u2019s working the way it\u2019s supposed to. That\u2019s why the next step is to pursue AI and machine learning that will continuously monitor the code to ensure it\u2019s working the way it\u2019s supposed to and providing results that can be trusted. But the models have to be kept extremely small, because connectivity isn\u2019t guaranteed. Different mission-critical applications have to share the limited bandwidth between the ISS and Earth, so the code has to be kept as small as possible to ensure it makes it to the edge in a timely fashion.\n\nAnother challenge is the process of transferring the data from the space station computers (SSCs) \u2014 which Wallace described as \u201ceveryday workhorse computers\u201d \u2014 that operate the DNA sequencing device, known as MinION, to the SBC-2.\n\n\u201cThose computers are not powerful enough to be able to do any of this \u2026 really computationally heavy part,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we had to have the data stored on the SSC, and then we had to have it moved to the ISS network, where it could be picked up by Spaceborne Computer-2. And just the act of moving these large files [was] not as straightforward as we would do just using a server or something on the ground.\u201d\n\nThat required collaboration from a number of different stakeholders to figure out how to make it work. But Wallace said that process is much easier at NASA than elsewhere. She attributes that to an overall culture of problem-solving at the agency. NASA is used to pushing technologies to their limits and pioneering new technologies and processes, she said, so where other agencies may start with roadblocks, NASA moves straight to solutions.\n\n\u201cSo while we have those challenges that we all pointed out, I think NASA is more open to \u2018OK, we have to find a way to fix it.\u2019 So you shave some of the time off the beginning of them telling you the old way to try it first. And they\u2019re more open to \u2018OK, we may not know the exact way to do it now. But we\u2019re going to go through and start working on a new path to get to the to the end goal,\u2019\u201d Wallace said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s why we are successful, is instead of initially throwing up roadblocks and making us go through a bunch of ground testing that we know won\u2019t work, we initially start trying to forge a new path to get to the end result.\u201d\n\nWallace said the whole idea here is to reduce risk as much as possible. Sending the DNA sequencer not only helped astronauts on the ISS get faster results, but it eliminates the risk of needing to culture large amounts of potential contaminants on the station. She said risk will be further reduced when they send up the MinION 2.0 device this spring. That will be able to handle much of the heavy computational burden itself, without having to link to the SSCs. Not having to perform that data transfer will further reduce the time-to-results, potentially down to as little as eight hours.\n\n\u201cWe also are working on taking the risk assessment piece of it one step further. So instead of just having a list of what microbes are there, that involving that risk assessment piece, and that\u2019s something we would want included down the road too: The water is good to drink, happy face, sad face kind of thing,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThe next step for us, like I mentioned earlier, is just giving the crew that autonomy to not have to wait for us to thumbs up/thumbs down a situation. And this is all building on that path to that autonomy for them and and that\u2019s super critical in our exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\u201d",
