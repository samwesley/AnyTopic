L3Harris Link 16 acquisition obtains regulatory approvals - SatellitePro ME
L3Harris Technologies has obtained all regulatory approvals for its acquisition of the Tactical Data Link product line – commonly known as Link 16 – from Viasat. Christopher Kubasik, L3Harris CEO and Chair, said: “We are in a position to close this acquisition much earlier than expected, which means we can welcome our new employees and begin work even earlier on this important modernization effort. The team is excited to deliver advanced tactical data links for this broadly used network, which will give our warfighters distinct advantages in multiple domains.” The company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the TDL network on October 3, 2022, with the deal originally expected to close in the first half of 2023. With US regulatory and allied partner approval now obtained, the deal is expected to close by January 3, 2023. The product line, comprised of nearly 450 employees and generating approximately $400m in annual sales, is installed in more than 20,000 US and allied platforms around the world enabling warfighters across multiple domains to securely share voice and data communications. L3Harris plans to modernise the technology, adding advanced tactical data links to the existing Link 16 network, achieving a level of resiliency relevant for evolving electronic warfare environments and JADC2 requirements.
