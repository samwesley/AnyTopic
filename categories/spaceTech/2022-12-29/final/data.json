The Philippine Space Agency warned agencies to take \"precautionary measures related to expected unburned debris\" from the rocket. China's last space launch of 2022, which lifted off on Thursday (Dec. 29), has prompted a warning of falling rocket space debris from the Philippine Space Agency. A Chinese Long March 3B rocket launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center Thursday carrying the Shiyan-10 02 satellite to be used for in-orbit verification of new space technologies, such as space environment monitoring.\n\nRelated: The 12 biggest rocket failures of 2022  After the launch, the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) recommended \"precautionary measures related to expected unburned debris from the Long March 3B rocket\" in a statement (opens in new tab). PhilSA officials issued the advisory to all relevant government agencies on the estimated drop zone area and proposed the issuance of appropriate warnings on air and marine access. The launch vehicle leftovers, such as the rocket boosters and payload fairing, were projected to fall within a drop zone area located within the vicinity of Recto bank. \"While not projected to fall on land features or inhabited areas within the Philippine territory, falling debris poses danger and potential risk to ships, aircraft, fishing boats, and other vessels that will pass through the drop zone,\" according to a PhilSA statement.

PhilSA reiterated its earlier public advisory to immediately inform local authorities if suspected debris is sighted. PhilSA also cautioned the public against retrieving or coming in close contact with these materials that may contain remnants of toxic substances such as rocket fuel.

          "FlaglerLive No Bull, no Fluff, No Smudges December 28, 2022 | FlaglerLive | 1 Comment  By Gareth Dorrian and Ian Whittaker It\u2019s been an eventful year for space exploration, with successes including the completion of Nasa\u2019s Artemis 1 mission (finally), the inauguration of the James Webb Space Telescope, and the completion of China\u2019s Tiangong space station. 2023 is set to be another busy year. Here are five of the most exciting missions to watch out for. In April, the European Space Agency (Esa) is set to launch the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), in what will be Europe\u2019s first dedicated robotic mission to Jupiter. Juice is due to reach the planet in July 2031 after performing an incredible flight path through the Solar System. The mission will enter into orbit around Jupiter and perform numerous flybys of its large icy moons: Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. After four years of moon flybys, Juice will then enter into orbit around Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System \u2013 becoming the first spacecraft ever to reach orbit around the moon of another planet. The icy moons of Jupiter are interesting as they are all believed to host oceans of liquid water beneath their frozen surfaces. Europa, in particular, is regarded as one of the most likely abodes in the Solar System for extra-terrestrial life. Juice will be equipped with ten scientific instruments including ice-penetrating radar to study the internal oceans. This use of radar is a practical first step in mapping the sub-surface oceans, paving the way for more exotic future missions involving submersible vehicles \u2013 some of which have already been put forward. The launch window runs from April 5 to April 25. Although no date has been announced by aerospace company SpaceX at the time of writing, the first orbital test flight of the super-heavy Starship spacecraft is highly anticipated to occur in early 2023. Starship will be the largest spacecraft capable of carrying humans from Earth to destinations in space (the International Space Station is larger, but it was assembled in space). It will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever to fly, capable of lifting 100 tonnes of cargo to low Earth orbit.\n\n\n\n\nStarship is the collective name for a two-component system consisting of the Starship spacecraft (which carries the crew and cargo) and the Super Heavy rocket. The rocket component will lift Starship to some 65km altitude before separating and returning to Earth in a controlled landing. The upper Starship component will then use its own engines to push itself the rest of the way to orbit. Several short test flights of the Starship portion of the system have been made with varying degrees of success. But the upcoming flight will be the first time the whole system will be used to reach space as one. This first orbital flight was originally scheduled to launch in September 2022, but has been delayed several times. The long-awaited dearMoon project, which will take members of the public on a six-day trip around the Moon and back, is due for launch on Starship and was originally planned for 2023. The exact date will depend on the successful test of Starship, but has been on the books since 2018. It will be the first true deep space tourism launch. Financed by business entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, a competition was set up to select eight members of the public (and an unknown number of crew) to join Maezawa on the trip \u2013 all completely paid for. The winners and criteria used have not been disclosed, although it is suspected the guests may be established or aspiring artists. This mission will mark a big change in the way we think about space, as previously only astronauts picked using incredibly stringent criteria have been able to go into deep space (note: we are not counting brief 10-minute jaunts up to 100 km). A full trip of several days poses extreme risks, both in terms of health and engineering.\n\n\n\n\nThe success or failure of the dearMoon mission could affect whether deep space tourism becomes the next big thing, or it is relegated back to being a pipe-dream. The Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security \u2013 Regolith Explorer, mercifully more commonly known as OSIRIS-REx, is a Nasa mission to near-Earth asteroid Bennu. A key goal of this robotic mission was to acquire samples of Bennu and return them to Earth for analysis. OSIRIS-REx is now fast returning to Earth with up to a kilogram of precious asteroid samples stored aboard. If all goes well, the capsule will detach from the spacecraft, enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and parachute to a soft landing in the deserts of Utah on September 24. Asteroid sample return has only been achieved once before, by the Japanese Space Agency\u2019s Hayabusa 2 mission in 2020. Bennu is an approximately diamond-shaped world just half a kilometre in size, but has many interesting characteristics. It is believed to have broken off from a much larger asteroid in the first 10 million years of the Solar System. Some of the minerals detected within it have been altered by water, implying that Bennu\u2019s ancient parent body possessed liquid water.\n\n\n\n\nIt also has an abundance of precious metals, including gold and platinum. Finally, Bennu is classed as a potentially hazardous object with a (very) small possibility of Earth impact in the next century. While SpaceX is the most prominent private space launch company, there are many others developing their own series of launchers around the world. Skyroot Aerospace, which successfully launched its Vikram-S rocket in November 2022, is soon to become the first private Indian company to launch a satellite. The rocket itself reached 90km in altitude, a distance that would need to be improved upon to get a constellation of satellites into orbit. Skyroot\u2019s first satellite launch is planned for 2023, with a goal of undercutting the cost of private space launch rivals by producing its 3D-printed rockets in a matter of days. If successful, this could also provide a route for cheaper launches of scientific missions, enabling a faster rate of research. Clearly, interest in the space sector remains high. With many bold advances and launches due in 2023, we are entering a new phase akin to the \u201cGolden era\u201d of space launches in the 1960s and \u201970s.

The mission will enter into orbit around Jupiter and perform numerous flybys of its large icy moons: Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.\nAfter four years of moon flybys, Juice will then enter into orbit around Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System \u2013 becoming the first spacecraft ever to reach orbit around the moon of another planet. The icy moons of Jupiter are interesting as they are all believed to host oceans of liquid water beneath their frozen surfaces. Europa, in particular, is regarded as one of the most likely abodes in the Solar System for extra-terrestrial life.\n\nJuice will be equipped with ten scientific instruments including ice-penetrating radar to study the internal oceans. This use of radar is a practical first step in mapping the sub-surface oceans, paving the way for more exotic future missions involving submersible vehicles \u2013 some of which have already been put forward. The launch window runs from April 5 to April 25.\n2. SpaceX Starship\nAlthough no date has been announced by aerospace company SpaceX at the time of writing, the first orbital test flight of the super-heavy Starship spacecraft is highly anticipated to occur in early 2023. Starship will be the largest spacecraft capable of carrying humans from Earth to destinations in space (the International Space Station is larger, but it was assembled in space). It will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever to fly, capable of lifting 100 tonnes of cargo to low Earth orbit.\n\n\n\n\nStarship is the collective name for a two-component system consisting of the Starship spacecraft (which carries the crew and cargo) and the Super Heavy rocket. The rocket component will lift Starship to some 65km altitude before separating and returning to Earth in a controlled landing. The upper Starship component will then use its own engines to push itself the rest of the way to orbit.\nSeveral short test flights of the Starship portion of the system have been made with varying degrees of success. But the upcoming flight will be the first time the whole system will be used to reach space as one. This first orbital flight was originally scheduled to launch in September 2022, but has been delayed several times.\n3. dearMoon\nThe long-awaited dearMoon project, which will take members of the public on a six-day trip around the Moon and back, is due for launch on Starship and was originally planned for 2023. The exact date will depend on the successful test of Starship, but has been on the books since 2018. It will be the first true deep space tourism launch.\nFinanced by business entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, a competition was set up to select eight members of the public (and an unknown number of crew) to join Maezawa on the trip \u2013 all completely paid for. The winners and criteria used have not been disclosed, although it is suspected the guests may be established or aspiring artists.\nThis mission will mark a big change in the way we think about space, as previously only astronauts picked using incredibly stringent criteria have been able to go into deep space (note: we are not counting brief 10-minute jaunts up to 100 km). A full trip of several days poses extreme risks, both in terms of health and engineering.\n\n\n\n\nThe success or failure of the dearMoon mission could affect whether deep space tourism becomes the next big thing, or it is relegated back to being a pipe-dream.\n4. Asteroid explorer returns to Earth\nThe Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security \u2013 Regolith Explorer, mercifully more commonly known as OSIRIS-REx, is a Nasa mission to near-Earth asteroid Bennu. A key goal of this robotic mission was to acquire samples of Bennu and return them to Earth for analysis.\nOSIRIS-REx is now fast returning to Earth with up to a kilogram of precious asteroid samples stored aboard. If all goes well, the capsule will detach from the spacecraft, enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and parachute to a soft landing in the deserts of Utah on September 24. Asteroid sample return has only been achieved once before, by the Japanese Space Agency\u2019s Hayabusa 2 mission in 2020.\nBennu the golden space rock.\nNASA/Goddard/University of Arizona\nBennu is an approximately diamond-shaped world just half a kilometre in size, but has many interesting characteristics. It is believed to have broken off from a much larger asteroid in the first 10 million years of the Solar System. Some of the minerals detected within it have been altered by water, implying that Bennu\u2019s ancient parent body possessed liquid water.\n\n\n\n\nIt also has an abundance of precious metals, including gold and platinum. Finally, Bennu is classed as a potentially hazardous object with a (very) small possibility of Earth impact in the next century.\n5. India\u2019s private space launch\nWhile SpaceX is the most prominent private space launch company, there are many others developing their own series of launchers around the world. Skyroot Aerospace, which successfully launched its Vikram-S rocket in November 2022, is soon to become the first private Indian company to launch a satellite.\nThe rocket itself reached 90km in altitude, a distance that would need to be improved upon to get a constellation of satellites into orbit. Skyroot\u2019s first satellite launch is planned for 2023, with a goal of undercutting the cost of private space launch rivals by producing its 3D-printed rockets in a matter of days. If successful, this could also provide a route for cheaper launches of scientific missions, enabling a faster rate of research.\nClearly, interest in the space sector remains high. With many bold advances and launches due in 2023, we are entering a new phase akin to the \u201cGolden era\u201d of space launches in the 1960s and \u201970s.\n\nGareth Dorrian is a Post Doctoral Research Fellow in Space Science at the University of Birmingham. Ian Whittaker is a\nSenior Lecturer in Physics, Nottingham Trent University.\n\n\n\nThe Conversation arose out of deep-seated concerns for the fading quality of our public discourse and recognition of the vital role that academic experts could play in the public arena. Information has always been essential to democracy. It\u2019s a societal good, like clean water. But many now find it difficult to put their trust in the media and experts who have spent years researching a topic. Instead, they listen to those who have the loudest voices. Those uninformed views are amplified by social media networks that reward those who spark outrage instead of insight or thoughtful discussion. The Conversation seeks to be part of the solution to this problem, to raise up the voices of true experts and to make their knowledge available to everyone.

          "So far it\u2019s been eye candy from heaven: The black vastness of space teeming with enigmatic, unfathomably distant blobs of light. Ghostly portraits of Neptune, Jupiter and other neighbors we thought we knew. Nebulas and galaxies made visible by the penetrating infrared eyes of the James Webb Space Telescope. The telescope, named for James Webb, the NASA administrator during the buildup to the Apollo moon landings, is a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. It was launched on Christmas one year ago \u2014 after two trouble-plagued decades and $10 billion \u2014 on a mission to observe the universe in wavelengths no human eye can see. With a primary mirror 21 feet wide, the Webb is seven times as powerful as the Hubble Space Telescope, its predecessor. Depending on how you do the accounting, one hour of observing time on the telescope can cost NASA $19,000 or more. But neither NASA nor the astronomers paid all that money and political capital just for pretty pictures \u2014 not that anyone is complaining. \u201cThe first images were just the beginning,\u201d said Nancy Levenson, temporary director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which runs both the Webb and the Hubble. \u201cMore is needed to turn them into real science.\u201d A Bright (Infrared) Future For three days in December, some 200 astronomers filled an auditorium at the institute to hear and discuss the first results from the telescope. An additional 300 or so watched online, according to the organizers. The event served as a belated celebration of the Webb\u2019s successful launch and inauguration and a preview of its bright future. One by one, astronomers marched to the podium and, speaking rapidly to obey the 12-minute limit, blitzed through a cosmos of discoveries: Galaxies that, even in their relative youth, had already spawned huge black holes. Atmospheric studies of some of the seven rocky exoplanets orbiting Trappist 1, a red dwarf star that might harbor habitable planets. (Data suggests that at least two of the exoplanets lack the bulky primordial hydrogen atmospheres that would choke off life as we know it, but they may have skimpy atmospheres of denser molecules such as water or carbon dioxide.) \u201cWe\u2019re in business,\u201d declared Bjorn Benneke of the University of Montreal, as he presented data of one of the exoplanets. Megan Reiter of Rice University took her colleagues on a \u201cdeep dive\u201d through the Cosmic Cliffs, a cloudy hotbed of star formation in the Carina constellation, which was a favorite early piece of sky candy. She is tracing how jets from new stars, shock waves and ionizing radiation from more massive nearby stars that were born boiling hot are constantly reshaping the cosmic geography and triggering the formation of new stars.\n\u201cThis could be a template for what our own sun went through when it was formed,\u201d Reiter said in an interview. Between presentations, on the sidelines and in the hallways, senior astronomers who were on hand in 1989 when the idea of the Webb telescope was first broached congratulated one another and traded war stories about the telescope\u2019s development. They gasped audibly as the youngsters showed off data that blew past their own achievements with the Hubble. Jane Rigby, project scientist for operations for the telescope, recalled her emotional tumult a year ago as the telescope finally approached its launch. The instrument had been designed to unfold in space \u2014 an intricate process with 344 potential \u201csingle-point failures\u201d \u2014 and Rigby could only count them, over and over. \u201cI was in the stage of denial,\u201d she said in Baltimore. But the launch and deployment went flawlessly. Now, she said, \u201cI\u2019m living the dream.\u201d Garth Illingworth, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who in 1989 chaired a key meeting at the Space Telescope Science Institute that ultimately led to the Webb, said simply, \u201cI\u2019m just blown away.\u201d At a reception after the first day of the meeting, John Mather of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Webb\u2019s senior project scientist from the start, raised a glass to the 20,000 people who built the telescope, the 600 astronomers who had tested it in space and the new generation of scientists who would use it. \u201cSome of you weren\u2019t even born when we started planning for it,\u201d he said. \u201cHave at it!\u201d Wayback Machine Thus far the telescope, bristling with cameras, spectroscopes and other instruments, is exceeding expectations. (Its resolving power is twice as good as advertised.) The telescope\u2019s flawless launch, Rigby reported, has left it with enough maneuvering fuel to keep it working for 26 years or more. \u201cThese are happy numbers,\u201d she said as she and her colleagues rattled off performance statistics of their instruments. Rigby cautioned that the telescope\u2019s instruments were still being calibrated, so the numbers might yet change. Perhaps the biggest surprise from the telescope so far involves events in the early millenniums of the universe. Galaxies appear to have been forming, generating and nurturing stars faster than battle-tested cosmological models estimated. \u201cHow did galaxies get so old so fast?\u201d asked Adam Riess, a Nobel physics laureate and cosmologist from Johns Hopkins University who dropped in for the day. Exploring that province \u2014 \u201ccosmic spring,\u201d as one astronomer called it \u2014 is the goal of several international collaborations with snappy acronyms like JADES (JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey), CEERS (Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science), GLASS (Grism Lens-Amplified Survey From Space) and PEARLS (Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science). Webb\u2019s infrared vision is fundamental to these efforts. As the universe expands, galaxies and other distant celestial objects are speeding away from Earth so fast that their light has been stretched and shifted to invisible, infrared wavelengths. Beyond a certain point, the most distant galaxies are receding so quickly, and their light is so stretched in wavelength, that they are invisible even to the Hubble telescope. The Webb telescope was designed to expose and explore these regions, which represent the universe at just 1 billion years old, when the first galaxies began to bloom with stars. \u201cIt takes time for matter to cool down and get dense enough to ignite stars,\u201d noted Emma Curtis-Lake, of the University of Hertfordshire and a member of the JADES team. The rate of star formation peaked when the universe was 4 billion years old, she added, and has been falling ever since. The cosmos is now 13.8 billion years old. Cosmic distances are measured with a parameter called redshift, which indicates how much the light from a faraway object has been stretched. Just a few months ago a redshift of 8, which corresponds to a time when the universe was about 646 million years old, was considered a high redshift. Thanks to Curtis-Lake and her colleagues, the record redshift is now 13.2, corresponding to when the universe was only 325 million years old. Curtis-Lake and her team had aimed the telescope at a patch of sky called GOODS South, looking for galaxies Hubble had been unable to detect. Sure enough, there were four of them, specters in the heat-fog of creation. Subsequent measurements confirmed that they were indeed way back in time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to say we believed it \u2014 publicly,\u201d said Brant Robertson, a JADES member from the University of California, Santa Cruz. The record is not expected to last long. The CEERS collaboration has reported a candidate galaxy that could have a redshift of 16, from when the universe was only 250 million years old. Experts are arguing about whether these overeager galaxies reveal something fundamental, and overlooked, in current theories of the early universe. Perhaps some field or effect juiced up gravity back then and sped up the growth of galaxies and black holes. Or perhaps the discrepancies merely reflect scientific uncertainties about the messy details \u2014 the \u201cgastrophysics\u201d \u2014 of star formation. For the past 20 years, astronomers have honed a solid \u201cstandard model\u201d of a universe composed of dark energy, dark matter and a smidgen of atomic matter. It\u2019s too soon to break that model, Curtis-Lake said in an interview; Webb has perhaps three decades of observing ahead of it. \u201cWe\u2019re in early stages,\u201d she said. In the closing talk, Mather limned the telescope\u2019s history, and praised Barbara Mikulski, a former senator of Maryland, who supported the project in 2011 when it was in danger of being canceled. He also previewed NASA\u2019s next big act: a 12-meter space telescope called the Habitable Worlds Observatory that would seek out planets and study them. \u201cEverything that we did has turned out to be worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are here: This is a celebration party, getting a first peek at what\u2019s out here. It\u2019s not the last thing we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Shark Tank India\u2019s Namita Thapar takes down \u2018toxic culture\u2019, says it\u2019s a myth that founders have to be \u2018arrogant\u2019: \u2018People confuse aggression with drive\u2019  ",

          "By: Radifah Kabir | Updated at : 29 Dec 2022 09:52 PM (IST) \n ISRO achievements 2022: Some of the most important ISRO feats achieved this year include (clockwise from left) the PSLV C-54 mission, Skyroot Aerospace's Prarambh mission, OneWeb India-1 mission, launch of India's first virtual space museum, and Gaganyaan's parachute test  ( Image Source : Twitter/@ISRO ) ISRO Achievements of 2022: The year 2022 was an important one for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) because the space agency conducted its first mission of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle, completed the first commercial mission of India's heaviest launch vehicle, and achieved important milestones for the Gaganyaan Programme, among other accomplishments. This year, India's first high throughput satellite broadband service was launched with ISRO infrastructure.  ISRO launched India's first virtual space museum in August. The Indian space agency also launched India's first privately developed rocket, Vikram-S. Recently, ISRO shared the first images of Earth captured by Earth Observation Satellite OceanSat-3 from space.  Here are some of the most important feats achieved by ISRO this year.  December 2022 Hypersonic vehicle trials: On December 9, 2022, ISRO and Headquarters, Integrated Defence Staff, jointly conducted hypersonic vehicle trials. \"The trials achieved all required parameters and demonstrated hypersonic vehicle capacity,\" ISRO said in a mission update.  A hypersonic vehicle flies faster than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5, and can enable a new class of flight vehicles that enable faster access to space, rapid military response at long range, and faster means of commercial air travel, according to an article published in the book, Lightweight Composite Structures in Transport. An aeroplane, missile or spacecraft can serve as a hypersonic vehicle. Rocket boosters can be used to develop a hypersonic vehicle.  Since a hypersonic engine uses oxygen from the atmosphere, the need to carry oxygen aboard the aircraft is eliminated. This reduces significant vehicle weight.  In order to produce a particular amount of thrust, the engine requires less than one-seventh the propellant that rockets need.  In September 2020, India became the fourth country to research and test defence weapons, after China, Russia and the United States. India has tested a Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV) missile that travelled six times faster than the speed of sound.  Australia, France, Germany and Japan are developing hypersonic weapon technology, and Iran, Israel and South Korea are conducting \"foundational research\" on hypersonic weapons, according to an article published by Voice of America.  MoU with Vyom Space: On December 6, 2022, ISRO and the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (INSPACe), an autonomous agency under the Department of Space, Government of India, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a private firm Vyom Space Exploration and Services. The MoU was signed to develop niche technology in the field of space, with special focus on a human and cargo transportation capsule programme.  ALSO READ | ISRO, INSPACe Sign MoU With Vyom Space To Develop Space Technology With Focus On Human Spaceflight Vyom Space is being incubated under Joint Services Innovation and Indigenisation Centre, Integrated Defence Staff (IDS). The MoU is intended for joint development of strategic technology in the field of space. November 2022 First images of Earth captured by OceanSat-3A: In November this year, ISRO shared the first images of Earth captured by OceanSat-3 from space. The first images were received on November 29, at National Remote Sensing Centre, Shadnagar. One of the images was that of Gujarat and its surroundings from space. OceanSat-3 also captured the Himalayan region, Gujarat Kutch region, and the Arabian Sea. ALSO SEE | ISRO Shares First Images Of Earth Captured By OceanSat-3 From Space. IN PICS The images were captured using the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and Sea Surface Temperature Monitor (SSTM) sensors.  PSLV-C54 Mission: On November 26, 2022, ISRO launched OceanSat-3A along with eight nano-satellites, as part of the PSLV-C54 or EOS-06 mission. OceanSat-3A is also called EOS-06. The other payloads launched were BhutanSat, a Bhutanese satellite, a nano-satellite called Anand, developed by Pixel India, and other nano-satellites developed by Dhruva Space, Astrocast and Spaceflight USA, a Seattle-based aerospace company. The satellites were launched atop a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), from First Launch Pad, Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.  OceanSat-3A is an Indian satellite designed to provide service continuity for operational users of the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) instrument on OceanSat-2, and will facilitate the potential of applications in other areas, according to nextspaceflight.com. The main objectives of the satellite are to study surface winds and ocean surface strata, monitor phytoplankton blooms, study suspended sediments and aerosols in the water, and observe chlorophyll concentrations. OceanSat-3A, the third flight unit of the OceanSat programme, has a mass of 960 kilograms, operates at 1,360 Watts, and has been placed into a sun-synchronous orbit.  India\u2019s first private launchpad in ISRO campus: On November 25, 2022, Indian space-tech firm Agnikul Cosmos launched the country's first private launchpad and mission control centre inside the ISRO campus at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. Agnikul Cosmos, a private aerospace manufacturer, has designed the launchpad, and will operate it. ALSO READ | Agnikul Cosmos Launches India's First Private Launchpad In ISRO Campus At Sriharikota The establishment of India's first private launchpad marks a significant step in opening the Indian space sector to private players, ISRO says on its website. The facility inside the ISRO campus has a launchpad and mission control centre, the latter being four kilometres away from the launchpad. Gaganyaan Parachute Test: On November 18, 2022, ISRO successfully completed the Integrated Main Parachute Airdrop Test (IMAT) of Gaganyaan's crew module deceleration system, marking a significant milestone for the Gaganyaan Programme. The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, where many Gaganyaan activities are being carried out, conducted this major development test at the Babina Field Fire Range (BFFR) in Jhansi district, Uttar Pradesh. The Gaganyaan Programme aims to demonstrate indigenous capability to undertake human spaceflight missions to low-Earth orbit.  ALSO READ | ISRO Completes First Parachute Airdrop Test. Know Why It Is A Significant 'Milestone' For Gaganyaan Programme The Parachute system for the Gaganyaan crew module consists of 10 parachutes. During the descent of Gaganyaan astronauts towards Earth in the future, two apex cover separation parachutes will be deployed in the initial stage. These parachutes serve as protection covers for the crew module parachute deployment. After this, two drogue parachutes will be deployed to stabilise the descent and bring down the velocity of the astronauts.  After the release of drogue parachutes, three pilot chutes will be used to extract three main parachutes individually, ISRO says on its website. This will help reduce the speed of the Gaganyaan crew module to safe levels before landing. Of the three main parachutes, two are sufficient to land the astronauts on Earth. The third parachute is redundant.  Complex testing methods such as rail track rocket sled (RTRS) will test the performance of the smaller parachutes, and aircraft or helicopters will evaluate the performance of the main parachutes. A rocket sled is a test platform that slides along a set of rails, propelled by rockets, and provides a controlled environment for high-velocity impact, aerodynamic and acceleration tests for articles such as payloads, aircraft and missiles, among others.  The Integrated Main Parachute Airdrop Test is important because it simulated a scenario in which one main parachute failed to open. This parachute test is the first in a series of tests planned to simulate different failure conditions of the Gaganyaan Parachute system. The system will be deemed qualified to be used in the first human spaceflight mission if all the tests are successful. In order to conduct the airdrop test, a five-tonne dummy mass, equivalent to the crew module mass, was taken to an altitude of 2.5 kilometres, and dropped using the Indian Air Force's (IAF's) IL-76 aircraft.  According to ISRO, the fully inflated main parachutes reduced the payload speed to a safe landing speed during the test, which lasted about two to three minutes. The airdrop test was successful, as the payload mass landed softly on the ground. ISRO and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) have designed and developed the parachute-based deceleration system for the Gaganyaan crew module.  Despite the fact that one of the main parachutes was prevented from opening in this simulated test, the inflated main parachutes successfully landed the payload on the ground. In this way, the first in a series of development tests planned to evaluate the performance of the Gaganyaan parachute system was successful. Launch of India\u2019s first privately-developed rocket: On November 18, 2022, ISRO launched India's first privately developed launch vehicle, Vikram-S, as part of the Prarambh mission. Prarambh was the maiden mission of Hyderabad-based space-tech startup Skyroot Aerospace, and received support from ISRO as well as INSPACe. Vikram-S was successfully launched into space from Sriharikota. The rocket carried three customer payloads, manufactured by Space Kidz India, Bazoom Q Armenia and N-Space Tech India.

New Space India Limited (NSIL), the commercial arm of ISRO.  OneWeb India-1 mission carried a payload mass of 5,796 kilograms, the heaviest for any ISRO mission to date.  The 36 OneWeb satellites have been placed into a low-Earth orbit, at an altitude of 1,200 kilometres above Earth. LVM3 has three stages and a height of 43.5 metres. The launch vehicle is a catalyst for the Indian Space Programme, because it will ensure the launch of heavy payloads into low-Earth orbit. September 2022 Hybrid motor test: The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre successfully test-fired a hybrid motor at the ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu, on September 20, 2022. The test-fire was supported by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), a research and development centre functioning under ISRO. A hybrid motor, unlike solid-solid or liquid-liquid combinations, uses solid fuel and liquid oxidizer. The 30 kilonewton hybrid motor tested by ISRO used Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as the solid fuel, and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer, which are compounds readily reacting with most organic material without any energy input.  ALSO READ | ISRO Successfully Test-Fires Hybrid Motor. Know Its Importance ISRO's test of the 30 kilonewton hybrid motor demonstrated ignition and sustained combustion for the intended duration of 15 seconds, the Indian space agency said in a mission update. The performance of the hybrid motor was satisfactory. Launch of HTS broadband service: On September 19, 2022, India's first High-Throughput Satellite (HTS) broadband service was launched with support from ISRO. Hughes Communications India Private Limited (HCI) announced the commercial launch of the HTS service at an event held in Le Meridien Hotel, New Delhi.  \u201cHTS means High-Throughput Satellite. It is a technology which takes a frequency and multiplies it many times,\u201d Shivaji Chatterjee, Executive Vice President, Hughes Communications India, told ABP Live. ALSO READ | India's First High Throughput Satellite Broadband Service Launched With ISRO Infrastructure \u201cInstead of one bandwidth per frequency, HTS enables you to get five to 15 times bandwidth per frequency. So it is a frequency multiplication and reuse, which then gives more bandwidth, and enables a better user experience and throughput,\u201d he added. Chaterjee explained that HTS provides much more bandwidth, lower-cost bandwidth, and a much higher user experience. \u201cHTS provides much more bandwidth. It provides much lower-cost bandwidth, and it provides a much higher user experience, because from a kbps service, it goes to multi-megabit service,\u201d he said. August 2022 India\u2019s first virtual space museum: On August 10, ISRO unveiled 'SPARK', India's first virtual space museum, as part of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav celebration.  S Somanath, chairman of ISRO, launched the virtual space museum for public use. SPARK showcases digital content related to different ISRO missions in an interactive manner. On the platform, one can see various documents, images, and videos related to ISRO launch vehicles, satellites, and scientific machines, according to the official website of the Indian space agency.

The documentary also highlights ISRO's upcoming missions including the Gaganyaan Programme and Chandrayaan-3 mission.  The three-dimensional virtual space tech park is a fun-filled park that includes a museum, a theatre, an observatory, a garden with life-sized rockets, a lakeside cafe area, a children's play area, and several other attractions.  There is a Solar System park in which the sizes of the different planets, from Mercury to Neptune, and that of Earth's Moon have been displayed. Test of Gaganyaan\u2019s Crew Escape System: On August 10, 2022, ISRO achieved an important milestone in the Gaganyaan Project. ISRO conducted a successful test-fire of the Low Altitude Escape Motor (LEM) of the Crew Escape System (CES), which will take the Gaganyaan crew module away from the launch vehicle in case any mishap occurs during the actual mission. ALSO READ | ISRO Achieves Important Milestone In Gaganyaan Project Through Successful Test Of Escape Motor Thus, the purpose of the CES is to rescue astronauts. SSLV-D1 Mission: On August 7, 2022, ISRO launched the maiden flight of its smallest launch vehicle. The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) took flight from First Launch Pad, Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission, called SSLV-D1, was the first developmental flight of the launch vehicle.  The primary payload of SSLV was an Earth Observation Satellite called Microsat 2A or EOS-02. A satellite named AzaadiSAT was also launched into space as a co-passenger on SSLV. However, SSLV failed to place Microsat 2A and AzaadiSAT into the intended circular orbit. As a result, the satellites are no longer usable, ISRO said in a mission update.  SSLV-D1 was supposed to place the two satellites into a 356-kilometre circular orbit. However, the satellites were instead placed into a 356 km \u00d7 76 km elliptical orbit.  ISRO said that the space agency will soon launch SSLV-D2, the second flight of SSLV.  July 2022 Space tourism capabilities: Union Minister of Science and Technology, Jitendra Singh, said in July that ISRO is developing indigenous capabilities towards space tourism through the demonstration of human spaceflight capability to low-Earth orbit (LEO). INSPACe also seeks to actively promote participation of the private sector in conducting end-to-end space activities, Singh further said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha Thursday. These end-to-end space activities include space tourism as well, according to a statement released by the Department of Space, Union Ministry of Science and Technology. June 2022 PSLV-C53 Mission: On June 30, 2022, ISRO launched the DS-EO satellite and two other co-passenger satellites from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The launch took place from the Second Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre.  The mission, called PSLV-C53, is the second dedicated commercial mission of NSIL. The DS-EO satellite, along with two other co-passenger satellites from Singapore, were placed into low-Earth orbit. The mission proposes to demonstrate the utilisation of the spent upper stage of the launch vehicle as a stabilised platform for scientific payloads following the separation of the satellites. PSLV-C53 is the 55th mission of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the 15th mission using the PSLV-Core Alone variant.  PSLV-C53 is a four-stage and 44.4 metre-tall rocket with a lift-off mass of 228.433 tonnes. GSAT-24 Mission: On June 22, 2022, NSIL launched the GSAT-24 satellite, a 24-Ku bNd communication satellite weighing 4,180 kilograms with Pan India coverage for meeting Direct-to-home  (DTH) application needs, atop the Ariane-V rocket, from Kourou, French Guiana. GSAT-24 is built by ISRO. May 2022 Static test of human-rated rocket booster for Gaganyaan: On May 13, 2022, ISRO successfully completed the static test of a human-rated solid rocket booster for the Gaganyaan Programme, at Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The booster, called HS200, is the human-rated version of the S200 rocket booster of LVM3. HS200 will be the first stage of the launch vehicle that will carry Indian astronauts to space as part of the Gaganyaan Programme. Therefore, the successful completion of the static test of the rocket booster is an important milestone for Gaganyaan.  LVM3 will be used for the Gaganyaan mission. In order to make the launch vehicle suitable for a crewed mission, some design improvements were made to increase the safety and reliability of the S200 booster.  The HS200 booster, loaded with solid propellant weighing 203 tonnes, was tested for a duration of 135 seconds. The booster is 20 metres long, and has a diameter of 3.2 metres. It is the world's second-largest operational booster with a solid propellant, according to ISRO.  The space agency monitored about 700 parameters during the test. The performance of all the systems was observed to be normal.  April 2022 \u2018Space on Wheels\u2019 documentary: In April this year, ISRO recently shared a documentary titled \"Space on Wheels\", which portrays an exhibition on 75 Indian satellites as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations. The documentary also highlights ISRO's upcoming missions including the Gaganyaan Programme and Chandrayaan-3 mission.  ALSO READ | Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav: ISRO 'Space On Wheels' Chronicles 75 Satellites Launched Under Indian Space Programme Since the inception of the Indian space programme, ISRO has designed and developed satellites for a wide variety of applications, such as communication, meteorology, Earth observation, space science, and navigation. April 2022 Chandrayaan-2 identified impact site of rocket on Moon: A rocket body collided with the Moon on March 4 this year. The object was observed to be heading toward a lunar collision last year.  The rocket body has left behind a \"double crater\", indicating that it was not the average rocket, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has found.   In April 2022, the Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2) onboard ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 imaged the far side of the Moon, and identified the impact site.  March 2022 Govt nod to build ISRO\u2019s second launch pad: In March this year, former ISRO Chairman Dr K Sivan said the central government and Tamil Nadu government have given permission to ISRO to acquire land in Kulasekharapatnam, Tamil Nadu, where the space agency plans to launch its second launch pad, news agency ANI reported.  He also said that soon, ISRO will be able to confirm the launch of Chandrayaan-3. Sivan said Chandrayaan-2 was the most complex mission conducted by ISRO so far. He also said that the main objective of the Gaganyaan mission is to take an Indian citizen to space on an Indian rocket from the Indian soil, and that a crew of three members will be launched to an orbit of 400 kilometres for a three-day mission. They will be brought back safely to Earth, and made to splash down in Indian waters.  February 2022 PSLV-C52 Mission: On February 14, ISRO successfully launched its first mission of the year, the PSLV-C52 mission. India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle PSLV-C52 injected Earth Observation Satellite EOS-04 into an intended sun-synchronous polar orbit of 529 kilometres. The satellites were launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre. This was the 80th launch vehicle mission from that space centre, and the 54th flight conducted by PSLV.  Apart from EOS-04, PSLV carried two small satellites as co-passengers.  January 2022 New Chairman of ISRO appointed: On January 14, 2022, senior rocket scientist S Somanath became the new Chairman of ISRO, and Secretary of the Department of Space.

          "The final frontier is getting crowded in 2023. The space economy is rocketing into 2023 on a gravitational wave of big headlines. Billionaire man-children racing to be the first industrial tycoon of outer space have been responsible for an unproportionate chunk of those headlines. It\u2019s understandable that they have been the focal point of journalistic missives from around the world, but the founders of Amazon, Virgin and the Boring Company hardly represent the big picture of the space economy. Still, their endeavours catch people\u2019s imagination of a potential interstellar future \u2013 as well as providing setups for jokes and jibes. Jeff Bezos blasting himself into the lower reaches of the final frontier riding a penis-shaped rocket has been the comedic gift that keeps on giving.  Similarly, Richard Branson may be able to claim to have breached the lower barriers of space, but his decades-long struggle to transform Virgin Galactic into a profitable project are still long ways off, raising questions about the business plan behind the venture.  Elon Musk, the chided chief twit who\u2019s seen Tesla shares tank since his Twitter takeover, has not engaged in the same kind of space tourism endeavours as his billionaire kin \u2013 apart from selecting a passenger to join a Space X trip around the moon at some point in the future. However, he has arguably made an impact on a geopolitical scale by providing Ukraine with access to his Starlink satellite network to protect the nation\u2019s digital infrastructure and prevent internet outages amidst the Russian invasion.  Although, whatever goodwill he may have drummed up from Ukraine seemingly evaporated in October when he posted a Twitter poll suggesting that the country should just give up some occupied territories to Moscow in order to end the conflict. Ukraine\u2019s German ambassador Andry Melynk fired back with an angry tweet, not mincing his words. \u201cFuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,\u201d Melnyk tweeted, adding that the \u201conly outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f\u2026ing tesla crap. So good luck to you.\u201d Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk   While the noise from these billionaire projects is overpowering at times, they don\u2019t detract from the fact that the space economy is heading into 2023 on a promise of stratospheric potential.  Research and analyst firm GlobalData has forecast that the industry will be worth over $1tn by 2040. In a recent report, analysts from the firm noted that while defense deals, scientific progress and celebrity flights make up the bulk of headlines, other factors play an even bigger part in the industry\u2019s future.  These factors include technological advancements in space solar cells, network latency and reusable launches. These advancements are set to stimulate real growth in the space economy. In addition, the researchers estimated that the construction of space stations, space tourism and mining projects will make up a significant amount of commercial space activity by 2030.  In order to make heads and tails of the future of the space economy, we reached out to market stakeholders and experts to hear their predictions for what\u2019s to come in 2023. Check out what they had to say below. AI and machine learning to be applied more widely to analyse huge datasets generated in space. While AI and machine learning are already used in other sectors, practical applications in space are currently in their very early stages. In 2023, however, we will begin to see new capabilities applied more frequently when it comes to analysing huge datasets generated by satellites.  Currently, most sensors in space downlink everything they are trying to collect, which makes it difficult for those on the ground to pick out signals from the noise in a timely manner. Using AI and machine learning to analyse this data on board makes it possible to only downlink relevant pieces of information rather than sending the data set. The benefits will be significant for people on Earth, enabling us to better protect citizens in near real-time. The rapidly increasing number of satellites in orbit has been a theme in 2022 and this seems sure to continue in 2023. While the Starlink internet satellite constellation has the most satellites in orbit, other constellations are on the horizon including Kuiper and BlueBird.  With this rapid growth, there is increasing concern about the environmental impact of satellite constellations, including light pollution of the night sky, and this has been highlighted by a recent report by the US Government Accountability Office and the launch of BlueWalker 3 (a prototype for BlueBird). There should be several new rockets launched into orbit for the first time in 2023. The first SpaceX Starship may launch in December 2022, but this could easily slip in 2023. Starship could be a game changer for launching very massive payloads into orbit \u2013 particularly if its costs are as low as predicted. The first Vulcan Centaur and Ariane 6 launchers are also planned for 2023 (amongst others), so the range of launchers available will look quite different in late-2023 to what it did 5 or 10 years ago. There will be many crewed spaceflights during 2023, including Crew Dragon, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the first (much delayed) crewed Starliner flight. Looking beyond 2023, excitingly, crewed circumlunar spaceflights with the Starship and Orion spacecraft are possibilities for 2024. There\u2019s plenty to look forward to in the space industry in 2023. The next year will be categorised by space tourism, exploration missions, innovation in the next generation CubeSats and excitement for the next Moon and Mars missions. One of the highly anticipated missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) interplanetary mission scheduled to launch in April 2023. The spacecraft will carry out mission studies to the Jupiter\u2019s moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa and will reach Jupiter in July 2031 after around eight years of travel. It will perform multiple gravity assists manoeuvre.  The spacecraft will eventually enter the orbit around Ganymede for its close-up mission, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than the moon of Earth. The JUICE mission will address two themes of ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme: What are the conditions for planet formation and emergence of life? and how does the Solar System work? The total mission duration is close to 11 years, of which about 3.5 years would be spent in the Jupiter system. The second anticipated mission is the Psyche mission and is scheduled to launch in October 2023. This is the first mission to a unique metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, to study the origins of its formation. Currently the mission is in the instrument, spacecraft assembly and testing phase and will be launched by NASA. This mission will shed light on the formation of the rocky planet with iron core. It could help in understanding the formation of our planet with iron core in the centre.  The successful launch of NASA Artemis 1 and all the future mission to Moon, Mars and beyond will propel more enthusiasm in the next generation of students to choose the STEM subjects. I am sure 2023 is going to be another exciting year for all the space enthusiasts and it will certainly ignite spark of curiosity in young space explorers to look beyond the horizon as sky is not the limit.  In 2023, space innovation will become even more vital for boosting defences and delivering advantages on Earth, especially in a time of increased conflict and tension. We\u2019ll therefore see more emphasis on growing the sector in line with the government\u2019s National Space and Defence Space Strategies. As part of this growth in innovation, a greater focus will be placed on involving smaller organisations in defence programmes and contracts. For this to happen, the relationship between \u2018primes\u2019 and SMEs will need to evolve beyond supply chains, which means working together in a new, dynamic way. Not only will this collaboration help smaller organisations in the space sector to grow, but it will also enable \u2018primes\u2019 to deliver enhanced capabilities to customers.  The onus is also on customers to encourage collaboration by outlining it in contracts and development programmes. Risk levels increase when working with smaller organisations, which is something customers will have to accept and build into programmes. Within all sectors, there is no doubt that sustainability will be a key focus in 2023 and beyond. For organisations within the space sector, there are two very different areas they need to address.  The first relates to the organisations themselves. Many will continue to find ways to develop capabilities in a sustainable way to meet the net-zero targets. This might include switching to clean energy sources and electric propulsion to working in partnership with other organisations to introduce new green initiatives. The second links to sustainability in space. There is currently a growing amount of junk and debris in space, which is leading to a sustainability dilemma. Over the coming years, we will see more efforts to build awareness around the impact of satellite launches and deploying new equipment, as well as removing dead satellites. We can also expect to see the sector innovate to increase the life expectancy and versatility of satellites.  At BAE Systems, for example, we\u2019ve partnered with in-space missions to invest in satellites that are reprogrammable. Moving away from deployment and launch for a single mission, providing reconfigurable, mission-specific satellites that can refuel and re-equip in the longer term will be critical. The first major satellite hack [is coming]. From the attacks on ViaSat via supply chain vulnerabilities which exposed the ground terminal, to more recent threats against Starlink low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, events in 2022 have indicated that the space race is far from over. In 2023, the focus will continue to shift towards satellite compromise, with the first major satellite hack to be expected in the next 12 months. This will likely involve all three main attack vectors: ground, communication links and payload hijacking.  From the ground station perspective, it is highly possible that vulnerabilities in physical security will be targeted. Leveraging the cost-of-living crisis, malicious actors could exploit insiders to gain direct access to satellite operations centres and mission operations centres. This will enable them to take control of spacecraft, disable communication links or capture all earthbound transmissions. Communication links will also be a prime target in the coming years. Earth-to-LEO satellite communications are vulnerable as spacecraft are frequently passing over potentially hostile territory. The adversary can use satellite blinding as these satellites pass to capture critical imagery or radio frequency data.  Lastly, poorly developed DevSecOps principles could see the introduction of malware based on the reliance on COTs code bases. A lack of understanding around code and applications could allow an attacker to hide on spacecraft payload and run tasks undetected. While the category may fall outside of what would traditionally be considered relevant to advances in the space industry, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) will play a pivotal role in the exploration of space communications in 2023.  The reason can be summarised in one word: data. While there are clearly many unique and interesting aspects about the space environment, the ability to securely and privately leverage the vast volume of space-related data across boundaries at scale is foundational to advancing our collective capabilities.    No matter where it takes place and the value it can provide, ubiquitous data usage is not without its challenges. Data is the backbone of the digital economy and organisations across all sectors are increasingly having to balance value extraction and risk management. The pace of change has left regulators and lawmakers scrambling to keep up, which frequently leads to a lack of clarity. PETs enable, enhance, and preserve the privacy of data throughout its lifecycle, allowing entities to achieve secure and private data usage without compromising data ownership or exposing sensitive indicators or insights. The PETs momentum began to build in the space arena this year as organisations worked together to design and build new space-based communications. In July 2022, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) announced the launch of its hybrid space architecture program (HSA), which aims to integrate commercial and government space assets to provide global, secure internet connectivity across multiple domains for commercial, civil, and military users, including international partners. This use case requires secure data sharing and collaboration, capabilities that can be uniquely provided by PETs. Leveraging the power of PETs, organisations can extract insights, cross-match, search, and analyse space-related data at scale in ways that are not otherwise possible. These capabilities are being woven into the fabric of projects like the HSA to help leverage both commercial and government space assets across diverse orbits to provide secure, assured, and low-latency data communications anywhere on and off Earth. In 2023, PETs will significantly help shape space as the mission landscape of the future where data interoperability, security, and access are critical to advancing any collaborative effort. I\u2019m really enthused by the advances we\u2019re likely to see in the space industry next year. No least the fact that 2023 will be marked by the first trials of \u2018direct to mobile\u2019 cellular connectivity from space, thanks to the growing constellation of low LEO satellites. The technology of these first-of-a-kind satellites features the huge phase-array antennas that will one day become the norm. No special user terminal is required, and they will work with a regular cell phone. AST Space Mobile are leading the way, but companies such as SpaceX have started their own design and development as competition hots up. Connectivity will start with text messaging services, but I predict this will be the catalyst for \u2018data everywhere\u2019 and a new gold rush for mobile network operators. Watch this space. Some other thoughts? Look out for innovations such as transparent phased array antennas, which will be a key and exciting area of research in 2023. Meanwhile, the coming 12 months will also see significant uptake for \u2018broadband from space\u2019 as the mega-constellations achieve operational status. The UK government has just announced a deal with Starlink to provide rural broadband coverage in certain parts of the country. The mega constellations target fixed wireless broadband and require dedicated terminal equipment. We\u2019re talking about a game-changer for some of the 3bn people in the world who have never used the internet. The technology is great for home and enterprise use, but there is increasing demand for \u2018comms on the move\u2019 and I anticipate further innovation that will enable high-speed data in current blackspots. I\u2019m thinking commercial aviation and maritime applications. As well as \u2018broadband from space\u2019 a quiet revolution has been happening in the \u2018remote IOT\u2019 world.  Satellites using narrowband technology enable COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) IoT devices to connect anywhere on the planet. 2023 will see initial trials and new commercial opportunities emerge as global low-cost, low-power data collection becomes a reality. And a final word \u2013 all of these new services require supporting infrastructure!.So, expect design and development of all of the following will advance in 2023: gas stations in space; assembly and maintenance vehicles in LEO; and network support infrastructure to include data trunking systems and backhaul plus data storage and processing.  Space solar power will be in increasingly discussed topic in as energy prices continue to rise and the need to address climate change intensifies. That means solar panels in space and energy transfer to earth using lasers or microwave beams. 2023? Bring it on. We saw a number of trends emerge in the spacetech sector in 2022, and we can only expect for them to continue throughout 2023. The burgeoning space industry will flourish as a result of the seeds sown in the previous year; an increasing budget, a global commitment to space exploration, and a growing awareness of the new space economy.  It\u2019s not only private individuals and venture capital firms that invest in space \u2013 the industry has both national and supranational backing. Towards the end of 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced a 17% rise in its budget, and it will be interesting to see how the region\u2019s space programme takes shape as this capital is distributed among nations.  Looking closer to home, the UK laid the foundations for a bright future in space this year. it\u2019s quite unlikely that there will be a rocket launch from UK soil in 2023. While Following the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Spaceflight Team, the Department of Transport and UK Space Agency\u2019s decision to granted grant the UK\u2019s first spaceport licence to Spaceport Cornwall, we will inevitably see how the intricacies of vertical launch sites still need are to be ironed out due to the complexities of those launches.  For Skyrora, in 2023 look forward to ensuring safe and responsible UK launch in the future through the granting of our launch vehicle licence application from the CAA, the application for which our talented team successfully completed and submitted earlier this year.we hope our launch operator licence application will be accepted.  This will of course bring us closer to our goal of orbital launch, and follows the momentum building milestones we achieved throughout 2022 to bring sovereign orbital launch capabilities to the UK. The technology is in place for the UK to have an agile and mobile launch infrastructure and market demand for a variety of in-orbit services is only going to grow stronger in the year ahead.

We will be happy to have you on board as a blogger, if you have the knack for writing. Just drop in a mail at toiblogs@timesinternet.in with a brief bio and we will get in touch with you. CEO & MD at Space Technology & Education Pvt. Ltd.                         The increasing popularity of space is evident in the media and the public\u2019s fascination with all things related to space. The number of books, movies, and television shows nationally and internationally has increased while the space technology & exploration missions of NASA and ISRO have also increased in recent years. This renewed interest in space is also evident in the number of people who are now interested in pursuing careers in the field of space science and engineering. The space sector is constantly evolving, with new advancements being made all the time one of the latest advancements is that allows users to experience anti-gravity and zero gravity at home through VR headsets. Content development is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionise the way we experience space. Space educators should take advantage of this tailwind and use it to inspire the next generation of space explorers. They should encourage young people to learn about the various aspects of space science and engineering and to consider pursuing careers in these fields. By doing so, they will help ensure that the future of the space sector is bright and that humanity has a chance of Space colonisation on Mars or other planets with new innovations and research. As Earth stands a a single-point failure to humanity, and NASA recently conducted the Dart Missions there is a chance that humans can be protected from external threats in future, from the potential situation of Asteroids colliding with Earth; this sort of magnificent mission and research should spark interest of today\u2019s youth to contribute to the field of Space Science either through educating others or helping develop technology. What to expect from the future of space exploration There is no doubt that space exploration has come a long way since its humble beginnings. With the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 (the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth) and the first space flight in 1961, humans have since been able to venture further and further into the great beyond. As technology continues to advance, the future of space exploration looks more and more exciting. With new advancements in propulsion systems, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), we could soon be exploring the solar system beyond in ways that were once thought impossible.  In the near future, we could see spacecraft powered by nuclear fusion or other advanced energy sources. These propulsion systems would allow us to travel much further and faster than we can today. There are many unknowns when it comes to the future of space exploration, but one thing is for sure: it is going to be an amazing ride. Other potential missions include sending manned missions to Mars and beyond, as well as establishing permanent human settlements on the Moon. With continued advances in technology, who knows what else we might be able to accomplish in the coming decades! As space exploration evolves, it is important for space educators to keep up-to-date with the latest developments. By staying informed, they can help inspire a new generation of explorers and ensure that our species\u2019 future includes a continued presence in the final frontier as Space exploration is our only important future for the survival of humanity.  As space exploration and involvement in the field increase, it is important for educators to be proactive in teaching about space. Teaching the basics of astronomy and space science will help give students a foundation on which to build more specific knowledge. Educators must use the correct expertise, hands-on activities, and industry research, while also involving parents to prevent changing a child\u2019s interest to common career paths as they are the easiest to enter, but they are also the most competitive. There are many different types of jobs involved in this field, so it is important for students to know what their options are. Introducing students to the different career options available in the field of space will help youth to be trained with a set curriculum of Astronomy and space to encourage superior growth in the future and it will open career field\u2019s in profile of becoming scientists, explorers, astronauts and entrepreneurs. There are endless possibilities when it comes to exploring and understanding our universe, so it is important for students to tap into their creativity. Encouraging students to be creative and thinking outside the box when it comes to space exploration. Educating about the importance of satellites, how the sun affects us, Earth being a single-point failure for humanity \u2013 what asteroids can do, etc. will lead to more acceptance of space science. Conveying the importance of Astronomy and Space Science so the myths and biased opinions around astrology can be changed, resulting in a stronger scientific temperament of our society. Conclusion Space educators should strive to take up the mantle and create a new generation of space explorers that can help humanity reach new heights. While there are job opportunities also to become a Space Educator, the same can be pursued after having graduation qualification in engineering or medical sciences as it would present the potential educator with a faster grasping of content knowledge that the educator will impart to students in future.

          "Led by the University of Copenhagen in collaboration with the University of Nottingham, the research suggests that when forests first emerged on Earth, atmospheric CO2 levels were far less than previously believed. The findings change over 30 years of understanding and could have significant implications for combatting climate change. The study, \u2018Low atmospheric CO2 levels before the rise of forested ecosystems,\u2019 is published in Nature Communications.  Our planet first started to become colonised by forests around 385 million years ago and was preceded by the emergence of shallow shrub-like plants with vascular tissue, stems, and shallow roots, which had no flowers. It was previously thought that atmospheric CO2 levels at that time were much higher than seen today, causing a greenhouse effect that led to a warmer climate. It was believed that the emergence of forests aided CO2 removal from the atmosphere, leading to the Earth\u2019s cooling. However, reconstructing atmospheric CO2 levels in the geological past is challenging and previously relied on proxies dependent on assumed parameters, leading to inaccuracies. Climate scientists agree that CO2 played a pivotal role in shaping our planet\u2019s climate in the past and present, but what controlled atmospheric CO2 levels is hotly contested. The researchers\u2019 new method looks to solve this ambiguity. Professor Tais Dahl, who led the study from the Globe institute at the University of Copenhagen, explained: \u201cWe calibrated a mechanistic model for the gas exchange between plant leaves and the ambient air to the oldest lineage of vascular land plants, namely clubmosses. With this approach, we could calculate the CO2 level in the air solely from observations made on the plant material.\u201d Their innovative method builds on three observations that can be made in living plants and fossil plant tissue, such as the ratio of two stable carbon isotopes and the size and density of stomata through which the plant uptakes CO2. The team calibrated the method in living clubmosses, illuminating that the method can accurately reproduce ambient CO2 levels in the greenhouse. Barry Lomax, Professor at the University of Nottingham and a co-author on the study, commented: \u201cThe newly calibrated method to study CO2 levels from the geological record is superior to previous approaches that produce estimates with unbound error bars simply because they depend on parameters that cannot be independently constrained in the geological record.\u201d The team utilised their method on several of the oldest vascular plant fossils that lived before and after trees evolved on our planet, revealing that the ratio of the two stable carbon isotopes, carbon-13 and carbon-12, is similar to modern plants. Moreover, the stomata\u2019s density and size were also similar, prompting a more comprehensive investigation of the early CO2 record, The scientists acquired data from 66 fossils of three distinct species of club mosses found in nine different areas globally, ranging from 410 to 380 million years in age. The atmospheric CO2 levels were only 30-70% higher \u2013 525 to 715 parts-per-million (PM) \u2013 than today in all cases. This is significantly lower than the previously believed 2,000-8,000 ppm. Additionally, the researchers employed a paleoclimate model to demonstrate the Earth was a temperate planet with a mean tropical surface air temperature of 24.1 to 24.6\u00b0C. Georg Feulner from the Potsdam Institute for Climate in Germany, who co-authored the study, said: \u201cWe used a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model to find that Earth had ice-covered poles when forests emerged. Yet, land plants could thrive in the tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones.\u201d The research suggests that trees actually play an insignificant role in reducing atmospheric CO2 levels over long periods because early trees had deeper root systems and produced more developed soils associated with lower nutrient loss. Due to more efficient nutrient recycling in soils, trees have a smaller weathering demand than shallow shrub-like vegetation living before them. This contradicts previous beliefs that trees with deeper root systems accelerated CO2 removal through enhanced chemical weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks. The model shows that primitive shrub-like vascular plants potentially drove a huge decline in atmospheric CO2 earlier in history as they spread among the planet. However, the model also demonstrates that the vascular ecosystem would have also led to a rise in atmospheric CO2 levels simultaneously.\n\n     \n \n  \n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n  \n\n  \u0394 Innovation News Network brings you the latest science, research and innovation news from across the fields of digital healthcare, space exploration, e-mobility, biodiversity, aquaculture and much more.

          "Biodiversity legislation increasingly calls for better vegetation monitoring, but can LIDAR imagery be beaten by space-based solutions? Despite their enormous complexity, a view from space has become almost commonplace. Thanks to online maps, everyone equates satellite imagery to an image of the roof of your home from several kilometres up. In recent months, many will have seen satellite images from the invasion of Ukraine, supplying up-to-date images piercing the fog of war. But these mental images hide the other potentials of space imagery, and the fact that visual data is only one part of the picture. Obtaining space imagery is no longer difficult, as advances in microsatellites have opened up the imagery market. These create a wealth of space-based imagery data, which can give answers to biodiversity questions when using appropriate post-processing. Utilities are increasingly employing predictive maintenance on their power lines, meaning regular scanning and monitoring. In a recent interview with Power Technology, Marc Spieler of Nvidia claimed LiDAR and supercomputers could seed a wave of infinitely complex digital twins. But Abhishek Singh, CEO of satellite imagery analysis company AIDash, and Sashin Mishra, AIDash\u2019s head of Europe and sustainability, disagree. They told us that much more comes from above than meets the eye, and that the complexity involved in monitoring utilities, landscapes or particular environments means that space might be the only environment for accurate asset monitoring. Various satellite companies offer imagery from different angles, at different times, across different wavelengths. Singh says: \u201cSo, the visual band is just one wavelength we have available. We also have multi-spectral bands, which has bands like near infrared, shortened wave infrared, radio waves \u2026 and each different bands give us different information, and they all have different capabilities. \u201cIf we wanted to monitor flooding, then we cannot use visual bands because they cannot see through clouds. We can use synthetic aperture radar imagery to penetrate through cloud and give complete flood mapping in almost real-time.\u201d This range of processes means space-based monitoring can be used for a range of functions, both within a particular industry, or with broader environmental applications such as monitoring biodiversity. \u201cIf I have to monitor temperatures, or if there\u2019s a wildfire, I can use infrared imagery to find if there are pockets or sections on land which are hotter than others,\u201d continues Singh. \u201cTo monitor forest health, I can use multi-spectral imagery which has visual signatures, but also has other bands which tell us about the tree health. It tells us about the dryness of the vegetation, showing dying trees, dead trees, healthy trees. From there, we can start to assess the health of an ecosystem, and its biodiversity.\u201d Most areas cannot be monitored frequently, regularly, quickly or in detail without significant cost. In many applications, LiDAR offers a comparable service. For systems monitoring, particularly on power lines, space-based imagery competes with ground-based LiDAR imagery. LiDAR uses laser emitters to build 3D models of their surroundings from relatively close range. This has created increasingly large digital twins of power supply lines, such as Fugro\u2019s digital twin of Tasmania\u2019s power distribution network. In the US, various power companies use LiDAR to map their power lines, and assess their vulnerability to storms. Naturally, Singh and Mishra have criticisms of the application of LiDAR. Singh says: \u201cLiDAR data collection is both slow and expensive. You have to fly your helicopter, or drive your vehicle along the power lines, so it takes months to collect data. Once that data is collected, analysing it takes weeks or months, so by the time the analysis is made, things have changed. \u201cNo utility in the world is using LiDAR frequently on their distribution lines. The use of LiDAR is primarily limited to transmission line monitoring. In the US, it monitors less than 10% of distribution lines.\u201d Mishra continues, pointing to the environmental damage associated with LiDAR monitoring: \u201cA helicopter typically flies at around 200kph. If it covers a line in one direction, it then has to fly back, halving its effective coverage over time. That doesn\u2019t count take-off and landing. That means that, for a line of about 150km or 200km, emissions would be about one ton of carbon dioxide. \u201cIf we break down a satellite\u2019s entire life cycle, including days of operation, images captured per day, then monitoring a 150km line would emit 69g per view. Ultimately, it\u2019s self-defeating from a sustainability point-of-view.\u201d While satellites are not without environmental impact, the satellites used for image gathering are much smaller than conventional satellites. These occupy otherwise unused spaces on other, larger satellite launches, in sizes down to that of a clenched fist. While these have much shorter operating lives than larger satellites, these microsatellites arguably have small launch emissions, and no operating emissions. Biodiversity describes the variety of plants and animals within an ecosystem. Each site has its own unique considerations, but biodiversity gives a broad-brush description of humanity\u2019s impact on an area. Many sectors \u2013 construction, mining, most heavy industries \u2013 can deal significant damage to an environment, and in this context, companies will look to maintain a region\u2019s biodiversity by ensuring the environment remains unchanged once its work is complete. The variety of animal life is hard to track via any distant method. However, all animals eventually rely on plants, which can be more easily assessed, and provide a snapshot of an industrial process\u2019s impacts on an area. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about utilities, but because of biodiversity monitoring, we\u2019re seeing interest from mining companies as well,\u201d says Mishra. \u201dWe\u2019re talking to a customer who would like us to look at the forest in Mozambique, which has regulations around biodiversity. Because they\u2019ve got these regulations, we can just map their definition [of biodiversity] back into our system\u201d Mishra adds: \u201cYou require some sort of a regulatory framework to be able to determine how to measure biodiversity, and that will be based on the country you operate in. Not all countries have regulations for this, but Europe is not the only area thinking about it. \u201cLocal flora and fauna change every few hundred kilometres. How, then, do you determine whether you bringing the right biodiversity? Can you just bring in any variety of tree or animal? The answer to that is no. You have to bring in local varieties, and that\u2019s where the regulatory framework really helps.\u201d Currently, definitions of biodiversity vary between countries and companies must take care to follow local regulations. Mishra said he believes that a unified global definition for a region\u2019s biodiversity would \u201ctruly benefit the industry a lot\u201d. This would allow a worldwide fungible biodiversity market, but this concept remains far from reality at the moment. Such a market would make regular biodiversity assessments a regular part of operations, with otherwise disinterested countries able to subscribe to the scheme. The deep complexity of establishing a unified biodiversity unit cannot be understated. However, there is no reason to believe it to be entirely impossible.

          "  The Global Impact STEM Academy in Springfield is working on two expansion initiatives: constructing a new facility on Clark State College\u2019s campus and adding new career pathways for students to connect to jobs in aviation and aerospace. Since 2020, Global Impact\u2019s governing board and administration have discussed and researched opportunities for the academy to create more space at the current location on South Limestone Street, serve more students, reduce barriers to college courses and expand the school\u2019s existing footprint. Global Impact, in partnership with the West Central Ohio Port Authority, now plans to build a 30,000-square-foot facility on Clark State\u2019s Springfield campus with an anticipated cost of $11 million to create an \u201cUpper Academy\u201d for grades 10-12. Founding director Josh Jennings said officials are in the design phase of the new facility, and he hopes to break ground in the summer of 2023 with occupancy in August 2024. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position where we can put a significant amount of capital towards the project. In addition, we\u2019re developing plans with long-standing partners who have expressed an interest in investing to support our efforts,\u201d Jennings said.  Along with providing the land for the Upper Academy facility, Clark State will also provide additional space on the campus for Global Impact programming and classes. Clark State President Jo Alice Blondin said the college and Global Impact have collaborated for years, and she looks forward to the location on the Leffel Lane campus. Having Global Impact\u2019s new building on Clark State\u2019s campus will allow the two entities to collaborate on what Blondin called \u201cone of the most exciting economic and workforce development opportunities in our region,\u201d the air mobility field. That includes work on electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles, called eVTOLs, at Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport. That is where the National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence is now under construction. The Global Impact site at Clark State \u201cwill serve as a training site for careers of the future, and students can complete their degree at Clark State,\u201d Blondin said. By alleviating capacity restrictions at Global Impact\u2019s current location inside the Springfield Center of Innovation at The Dome, the new facility will also help serve more students. The goal is to expand programming down to sixth grade starting in August 2024 and serve more students overall in grades 7-12. \u201cThis is in response to the current demands we see in our region,\u201d Jennings said. Mke McDorman, president and CEO of the Greater Springfield Partnership, said, \u201cThis is an important next step as the community seeks to develop new company investments and jobs\u201d related to the National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence being built at the airport. \u201cThese aerospace and aviation technology curriculum opportunities will help pave the way for area students to step into good-paying jobs right here in Springfield,\u201d he said. \u201cGISA, working with Clark State and the National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence, will also help our area win over other locations around the country in the attraction of these \u2018Jetson\u2019s like\u2019 aviation company investments and jobs.\u201d The Upper Academy will serve the higher grade students who will be preparing to enter the workforce or to choose a career path to continue their education. For example, of the 91 students who graduated in 2022, 32 received an associate\u2019s degree and a total of 3,584.5 college credits were earned. As for next steps, Jennings said it will be a continuation of working through the design process to finalize what is needed based on the programming. Over the next few weeks, initial surveying will take place and, once a design is finalized, a guaranteed maximum price will be proposed. The new career pathway will be Aerospace and Aviation Technology. Global Impact leadership, industry professionals from around Ohio and the Ohio Department of Education\u2019s Office of Career Technical Education have explored this new pathway and what programming would look like to support the technologies. Although the academy has had success in its current programs of agriculture, food, natural resources and bioscience, Jennings said \u201cit made sense\u201d to integrate the new pathway. Regional leaders approached the school over a year ago to consider exploring and implementing opportunities in the aerospace and aviation technology fields. \u201cConsidering the current implications that this industry already had on the agriculture industry in areas such as unmanned aerial systems (drone) technology and precision technology, it made sense to look at integrating these themes and concepts,\u201d Jennings said. How this new curriculum will be implemented will reflect how the current programming in agriculture and bioscience is delivered, Jennings said. Specific courses will depend on input from industry professionals and what is needed to support the emerging technologies in the area of advanced air mobility. \u201cWe want to continue to provide relevancy in traditional disciplines through authentic real-word scenarios and applications,\u201d he said. The academy is currently accepting applications for next year\u2019s seventh-grade class, with applications due Jan. 13. Students who apply will be considered for the lottery, and those who don\u2019t make it will be waitlisted and considered once the expansion begins next year in preparation for fall 2024.

Five North Korean drones crossed into South Korea on Monday, prompting South Korea's military to scramble fighter jets and attack helicopters, though it failed to bring down the drones, which flew over South Korea for hours. Amid criticism over South Korea's air defences at a time of North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threats, Yoon visited the state-run Agency for Defence Development to check the country's reconnaissance and interception capabilities and called for an overhaul of the response system against \"all flying objects\". \"North Korean drones' intrusion of our airspace is an intolerable incident,\" Yoon said. \"We should let them learn that provocations are always met by harsh consequences.\" Yoon has slammed the military's handling of Monday's incursion, the first since 2017, urging it to hasten the reinforcement of drone units.  The military apologised for its response, and said it could not shoot down the drones because they were too small. \"To secure peace, we need to prepare for a war with overwhelming capabilities,\" the president said, adding that the South's defence procurement strategy should also be reviewed in line with the North's weapons advances.  On Thursday, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the country's military would hold drone-focused exercises.  \"Our military will conduct joint air defence drills ... simulating response to enemy's small-sized unmanned aircraft,\" a JCS spokesperson told a regular briefing.

          "Sharon Wrobel is a tech reporter for The Times of Israel. Israel will fund a NIS 21.6 million ($6.1 million) program to train and integrate more than 2,000 Arab Israeli women and men into the local high-tech industry over the next two years as part of a continued effort to narrow the employment and income gaps between Jewish and Arab Israelis. The Israel Innovation Authority (IAA) together with the labor division of the Economy and Industry Ministry selected 12 programs for the training and placement of 2,239 people from the Arab population. The 12 selected programs will receive an aggregate government grant of NIS 12 million and the remainder is to be financed by private funds. Participation rates of the Arab population in the tech employment market remains low despite numerous government initiatives. Long touted as the growth engine of the Israeli economy, the tech sector accounts for around 25% of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total income tax revenue and constitutes about 10% of the workforce. Arab Israelis make up some 20% of the population but just 2% of Arab men and 1% of Arab women working in the tech industry, according to government data. That compares with 12% of secular Jewish men and 8% of secular Jewish women. At the same time, the tech industry is facing an acute shortage of skilled engineers and programmers. This scarcity could cause the engine to stall, and the country is seeking to tap into new populations sectors to keep it going. Low-income populations have largely been left on the sidelines of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-tech boom, including the ultra-Orthodox, Arab Israelis, and women, resulting in large income gaps. The ultra-Orthodox and Arab populations, among the poorest in Israel today, are expected to constitute half of the population by 2065, according to the OECD. \u201cThis reflects a lack of the skills needed for them to get high-productivity and well-paid jobs,\u201d according to the OECD report. \u201cIntegrating the Arab-Israeli and Haredim into the labour market remains one of the key challenges for the Israeli economy.\u201d This year, over 10,000 workers from the Arab population were employed in the tech industry, but half of them were in non-technological positions, according to Tair Ifergan, director general of the labor division at the Economy and Industry Ministry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough the percentage of Arab citizens employed in the tech industry is still below the national average, in recent years, we have seen an increasingly positive trend of integration of the Arab population and a significant increase in the number of Arab students studying tech-related subjects in academia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said IIA CEO Dror Bin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe aim to increase the number of Arab citizens employed in tech and create a significant economic, social and regional change as part of the strengthening and diversification of the Israeli tech sector.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRapid and proper integration of graduates of these programs will be one of the significant steps toward reducing the shortage of tech personnel in the long term,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bin noted. More than half of the selected programs in the project will train for advanced development positions in the tech sector, such as programming, and include theoretical and practical on-the-job training. Soft skills will also be part of the training to expand the candidates\u2019 skill set and boost their chances of getting a high-quality job in tech. One of the funded programs will provide training and help in the job placement in the following four tech areas: robotics and automation, verification, DevOps and data analytics. Another program focuses on career development and promotion to managerial positions for tech workers in Arab society.

          "L3Harris Technologies has obtained all regulatory approvals for its acquisition of the Tactical Data Link product line \u2013 commonly known as Link 16 \u2013 from Viasat. Christopher Kubasik, L3Harris CEO and Chair, said: \u201cWe are in a position to close this acquisition much earlier than expected, which means we can welcome our new employees and begin work even earlier on this important modernization effort. The team is excited to deliver advanced tactical data links for this broadly used network, which will give our warfighters distinct advantages in multiple domains.\u201d The company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the TDL network on October 3, 2022, with the deal originally expected to close in the first half of 2023. With US regulatory and allied partner approval now obtained, the deal is expected to close by January 3, 2023. The product line, comprised of nearly 450 employees and generating approximately $400m in annual sales, is installed in more than 20,000 US and allied platforms around the world enabling warfighters across multiple domains to securely share voice and data communications. L3Harris plans to modernise the technology, adding advanced tactical data links to the existing Link 16 network, achieving a level of resiliency relevant for evolving electronic warfare environments and JADC2 requirements.

tactical data links to the existing Link 16 network.\nL3Harris Technologies has obtained all regulatory approvals for its acquisition of the Tactical Data Link product line \u2013 commonly known as Link 16 \u2013 from Viasat.\nChristopher Kubasik, L3Harris CEO and Chair, said: \u201cWe are in a position to close this acquisition much earlier than expected, which means we can welcome our new employees and begin work even earlier on this important modernization effort. The team is excited to deliver advanced tactical data links for this broadly used network, which will give our warfighters distinct advantages in multiple domains.\u201d\nThe company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the TDL network on October 3, 2022, with the deal originally expected to close in the first half of 2023. With US regulatory and allied partner approval now obtained, the deal is expected to close by January 3, 2023.\nThe product line, comprised of nearly 450 employees and generating approximately $400m in annual sales, is installed in more than 20,000 US and allied platforms around the world enabling warfighters across multiple domains to securely share voice and data communications. L3Harris plans to modernise the technology, adding advanced tactical data links to the existing Link 16 network, achieving a level of resiliency relevant for evolving electronic warfare environments and JADC2 requirements.\n\nTagsfeaturedpost L3Harris Technologies Tactical Data Link TDL network ViaSat \n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMilitary and Government \u2022 News \u2022 Vertical Markets\nTerran Orbital completes order for SDA\u2019s Tranche 0 Transport Layer\n5 days ago\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBroadband/Connectivity \u2022 News \u2022 Tech Updates\nNokia and etisalat by e& show 100 Gbps fiber broadband\n7 days ago\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNews \u2022 Satellite\nVirgin Orbit receives UK\u2019s first orbital launch license\n7 days ago\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5G \u2022 News \u2022 Tech Updates\nEricsson, Solutions by STC and ACES to deliver indoor 5G solution in Saudi\n7 days ago\n\n \n\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNews \u2022 Sponsored Content\nOutside broadcast transformed by Newtec Dialog\nSeptember 11, 2019\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBroadband/Connectivity \u2022 IoT \u2022 Operators \u2022 Satellite \u2022 Sponsored Content \u2022 Vertical Markets\nConnect More People, Places and Things Everywhere\nMarch 7, 2019\n\n \n\n\nAdd Comment\nClick here to post a comment\n\n Cancel replyCommentName * \nEmail * \nWebsite\n Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n\u0394 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIGCOMSAT appoints new managing director \n\nComment\n\nShare This!\n\n Facebook \n Twitter \n Google Plus \n LinkedIn \n Email \n WhatsApp \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAviation \u2022 News \u2022 Vertical Markets\nGilat and Intelsat expand in-flight connectivity partnership\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNews \u2022 UAE Space Projects \u2022 Vertical Markets\nUAE Space Agency launches Space Workshops\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBroadcasting \u2022 News \u2022 Vertical Markets\nEutelsat issues statement on suspension of programmes in Russia and Iran\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNews \u2022 Sponsored Content\nOutside broadcast transformed by Newtec Dialog\nSeptember 11, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMilitary and Government \u2022 News \u2022 Vertical Markets\nTerran Orbital completes order for SDA\u2019s Tranche 0 Transport Layer\n5 days ago\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBroadband/Connectivity \u2022 News \u2022 Tech Updates\nNokia and etisalat by e& show 100 Gbps fiber broadband\n7 days ago\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNews \u2022 Satellite\nVirgin Orbit receives UK\u2019s first orbital launch license\n7 days ago\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5G \u2022 News \u2022 Tech Updates\nEricsson, Solutions by STC and ACES to deliver indoor 5G solution in Saudi\n7 days ago\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNews \u2022 Sponsored Content\nOutside broadcast transformed by Newtec Dialog\nSeptember 11, 2019\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBroadband/Connectivity \u2022 IoT \u2022 Operators \u2022 Satellite \u2022 Sponsored Content \u2022 Vertical Markets\nConnect More People, Places and Things Everywhere\nMarch 7, 2019\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAviation \u2022 News \u2022 Vertical Markets\nGilat and Intelsat expand in-flight connectivity partnership\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNews \u2022 UAE Space Projects \u2022 Vertical Markets\nUAE Space Agency launches Space Workshops\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBroadcasting \u2022 News \u2022 Vertical Markets\nEutelsat issues statement on suspension of programmes in Russia and Iran\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNews \u2022 Sponsored Content\nOutside broadcast transformed by Newtec Dialog\nSeptember 11, 2019\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGilat and Intelsat expand in-flight connectivity partnership\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUAE Space Agency launches Space Workshops\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEutelsat issues statement on suspension of programmes in Russia and Iran\n\n\n\n",

Get the best futuristic stories straight into your inbox before everyone else! Get the best futuristic stories straight into your inbox before everyone else! It\u2019s a fundamentally new technique. Electromagnetic noise poses a significant communication problem, prompting wireless carriers to invest heavily in technologies to overcome it. Despite being a nuisance, it can tell many things by studying noise. By measuring the noise in a material, physicists can learn its composition, temperature, how electrons flow and interact with one another, and how it spins to form magnets. It is generally difficult to measure how the noise changes in space or time. Scientists at Princeton University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have created a method to measure noise in a material by studying correlations. They can use this information to learn the spatial structure and time-varying nature of the noise. The method uses specially designed diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy centers. This method, which tracks minute variations in magnetic fields, is a significant advancement over earlier ones that averaged numerous different readings. The highly controlled diamond structures are called nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. These NV centers are modifications to a diamond\u2019s carbon atom lattice when a carbon atom is swapped out for a nitrogen atom, and there is an empty space, or vacancy, next to it in the chemical structure. A diamond with NV centers is one of the few instruments that can record changes in magnetic fields at the scale and speed required for crucial studies in quantum technology and condensed matter physics. Even while a single NV center made it possible to monitor magnetic fields with great precision, it wasn\u2019t until scientists figured out how to use several NV centers that they could analyze the spatial organization of noise in a material. Nathalie de Leon, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton University, said, \u201cThis opens the door to understanding the properties of materials with bizarre quantum behaviors that until now have been analyzed only theoretically.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamentally new technique. It\u2019s clear from a theoretical perspective that it would be very powerful to do this. The audience that I think is most excited about this work is condensed matter theorists; now that there\u2019s this whole world of phenomena, they might be able to characterize differently.\u201d Quantum spin liquid is one such phenomenon, where electrons are constantly in flux, in contrast to the solid-state stability that characterizes a typical magnetic material when cooled to a specific temperature. de Leon said, \u201cThe challenging thing about a quantum spin liquid is that by definition, there\u2019s no static magnetic ordering, so you can\u2019t just map out a magnetic field\u201d as you would with another type of material. Until now, there\u2019s been no way to measure these two-point magnetic field correlators directly, and people have instead been trying to find complicated proxies for that measurement.\u201d Scientists may determine how electrons and their spins flow throughout a material\u2019s space and time by measuring magnetic fields simultaneously at several sites with diamond sensors. To create the novel technique, the team exposed a diamond with NV centers to calibrated laser pulses and afterward noticed two spikes in photon counts coming from a pair of NV centers, a readout of the electron spins at each center at the same instant. Study coauthor Shimon Kolkowitz, an associate professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, \u201cOne of those two spikes is a signal we\u2019re applying, the other is a spike from the local environment, and there\u2019s no way to tell the difference.

As 2022 comes to a close, a few stories stand out as the wildest, most inspiring breakthroughs. Here\u2019s our list of the best Horizons stories of the year.

          "HELSINKI \u2014 China has conducted its 64th and final launch of the year, sending the Shiyan-10 (02) into orbit from Xichang spaceport. A Long March 3B rocket lifted off from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China at 11:43 p.m. Eastern Dec. 28, carrying Shiyan-10 (02). The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC), confirmed launch success shortly after.  The purpose of the satellites was not revealed. Shiyan series satellites are often classified and understood to be used to test new technologies and payloads for Chinese space systems. State media Xinhua stated the new satellite will be \u201cused for in-orbit verification of new space technologies, such as space environment monitoring.\u201d The Shiyan-10 (02) is a classified spacecraft which could be sent to join the earlier Shiyan-10 satellite in a highly-elliptical Molniya orbit to provide greater operational coverage of the northern hemisphere. The first Shiyan-10 satellite launch from Xichang Satellite Launch Center Sept. 27, 2021. It was initially reported by CASC to be stranded in transfer orbit. It was later picked up in a highly elliptical 1,880 by 38,881 kilometer altitude orbit with an inclination of 63.6 degrees, having effected a large alteration to its earlier orbital inclination, putting it into a Molniya orbit.  Such orbits\u2014the highly elliptical nature of which means spacecraft spend most of their roughly 12-hour orbital period visible over the northern hemisphere\u2014are used for communications, remote sensing or missile early warning systems, climate and weather monitoring, early warning systems and other purposes such as signals intelligence.  The new satellite could be sent into a similar orbit to the first satellite, but with a different right ascension of the ascending node to provide greater coverage over the northern hemisphere.  When the spacecraft is near its apogee over the northern hemisphere, it will appear to move slowly over the Earth below. This makes the orbit useful for providing communications between two sites in the northern hemisphere or monitoring for early warning. Constant services can be provided by placing three satellites in similar Molniya orbits, each providing links for several hours each day. China operates its China Remote Sensing Satellite North Polar Ground Station, which is located in Kiruna, northern Sweden, which would be visible to the Shiyan-10 satellites for long periods near its apogee.  The mission followed the Dec. 27 launch of the Gaofen-11 (04) Earth observation satellite from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north China using a Long March 4B rocket. Earlier reports indicate these satellites belong to a classified segment of China\u2019s Gaofen series, with the capability to return optical imagery at a resolution of around 10 centimeters. The Shiyan-10 (02) launch was China\u2019s 64th of 2022. This meant the country has far surpassed its previous national record for a calendar year of 55, set in 2021. 53 of the 2022 launches were Long March rocket launches conducted by CASC, all of which were successful.
