"One major driver of progress of the Indian private space sector has been the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which has a reputation for successfully launching low-cost satellite missions. This has attracted private companies to invest in the sector, as they see the potential for collaboration with ISRO and the opportunity to tap into the agency's expertise and facilities. The message to create ISRO as the nucleus for the space enterprising activities in India was reiterated by ISRO Chairman and Secretary Department of Space (DoS) Somanath S when he took charge of the organization earlier in January 2022," says Bhatt.
