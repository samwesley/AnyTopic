From successful launches and the deployment of satellites to groundbreaking collaborations and the development of new technologies, it has been a year of achievements and exciting milestones.The Indian private space sector reached untreaded territory and presented the potential to spur growth and create new opportunities faster than any other developed countries, and the current accomplishments achieved by India’s private space industry are apparent. This is the result of the landmark decision taken by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2020 to open our space industry to the private sector. The current space ecosystem is the effect of personal attention and support provided by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has been a source of strength &amp; motivation for the space industry.One major driver of progress of the Indian private space sector has been the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which has a reputation for successfully launching low-cost satellite missions. This has attracted private companies to invest in the sector, as they see the potential for collaboration with ISRO and the opportunity to tap into the agency's expertise and facilities. The message to create ISRO as the nucleus for the space enterprising activities in India was reiterated by ISRO Chairman and Secretary Department of Space (DoS) Somanath S when he took charge of the organization earlier in January 2022. The space enterprise vision must be collated with apropos policies that support the growth of the private space industry, such as providing financial and regulatory support to private companies and encouraging partnerships between the public and private sectors.As we look back at the year 2022, the industry witnessed some major milestones in the growth journey of the private sector with the landmark launch of first private launch vehicle from Skyroot and NSIL authorizing the space conglomerate formed by Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) and HAL a Rs 860-crore contract for the commercial development of next 5 Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLVs) and the pact of OneWeb with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) to launch LEO satellites from India and signing the first license contract with DoT for satellite broadband followed by the successful launch of 36 LEO satellites from Sriharikota and NELCO becoming the fourth company to seek GMCPS license to provide satellite broadband services in collaboration with Telesat. Hughes Communications India (HCI), in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), launched its first high throughput satellite (HTS) broadband internet service in the country. Astrome received a grant from DoT for developing the next-gen 5G wireless X-haul gear, GalaxEye won among the 30 most promising space startups of 2022 as per the 11th annual edition of the 'Tech30 Report' by Tech Sparks 2022. Oceansat-3 satellite launched with active contributions of Aidin Technologies, MIL Industries, Ananth Technologies &amp; Kepler Aerospace. Centum Electronics partnered with Rafael -Advanced Defense Systems for indigenous manufacture of electronic warfare systems. Elena Geo Systems Private Limited has developed the first NavIC based Drone Navigation Unit. MapMyIndia unveiled ‘Mappls’ a swadeshi consumer application providing state-of-the-art indigenous maps and navigation tools.Rising Indian space startups like Skyroot launched the first private launch vehicle in this year which has made significant strides in the growth of the private space industry. Also, Pixxel launched its third hyperspectral satellite ‘Anand’ for Earth observation applications following the launch of ‘Shakuntala’ earlier this year, Dhruva Space successfully validated its Satellite Orbital Deployer during the PSLV C53 mission and subsequently launched 2 nanosatellites for amateur communications in PSLV C54 using P-dot satellite platform, Digantara built the world’s first commercial space weather sensor, Agnikul Cosmos under the aegis of IN-SPACe established India’s first private space vehicle launch pad at Sriharikota. SpaceKidz's satellite 'FunSat' was successfully launched by Skyroot's Vikram S. Alpha Design Technologies provided ISRO with their first crew module fairing (CMF) structure to protect astronauts for the incumbent Gaganyaan mission. These strides by the startups and young entrepreneurs will encourage technology development in space for defence applications through 75 Defence Space Challenges aka Mission DefSpace launched by Hon’ble PM during DefEXPO 2022.The establishment of IN-SPACe as a single-window, independent, nodal agency in lieu of Department of Space (DOS) has also benefited the space programme vision. As of December 26, 2022 IN-SPACe has received a total 101 proposals based on category and a total of 396 NGEs have registered on IN-SPACe Digital Platform. The formation of IN-SPACe to handhold and promote the private sector culminated in the breakthrough signing of MoUs between ISRO/IN-SPACe and ISpA Startup members (Agnikul, Astrome, Bellatrix, Dhruva, Digantara, TSC Technologies and Skyroot).These administrative measures to streamline the advent of private companies in the space sector signify a growing demand for satellite-based services in India, including satellite-based communication, remote sensing, and earth observation. This demand is being driven by the country's expanding economy, population, and infrastructure, as well as by the increasing reliance on technology and the need for more efficient and effective ways to manage natural resources.The initiatives by the government authorities brought together the industry stakeholder for their suggestions on the new Space Policy, spectrum auctions and licensing framework for establishing satellite earth station gateway and DoTs landmark move on abolishing the NOCC charges which signifies government's continued commitment in supporting the growth of digital communication therefore giving a much-needed push to the spread of satellite communication in the country.For furthering support to the nascent space industry and to reduce the ‘digital divide’ the government may consider the administrative allocation of spectrum. The sustainable growth of satellite communications in India depends on the harmonization of 28 GHz frequency according to the global standards set by ITU-APT, as the retention of 28 GHz frequency within the space sector will support and help connect the unconnected and provide impetus to local manufacturing &amp; innovation.The number of space startups in India has already crossed the 100th mark and these startups have raised funding of more than $263.35 million. We expect the new ‘Indian Space Policy’ to be announced early next year which will enable India to likely achieve the capabilities much earlier, as compared to other developed countries like the US. The new ‘Indian Space Policy’ followed by the Space Activity Bill will be a complete game changer which will cover upstream and downstream activities and help formulate vision to bolster the investment climate in the private space sector. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for satellite manufacturing just like the mobile handsets and telecom equipment will further boost the private space ecosystem and help encourage new startups to come up. With the first private launch taking place in India recently we envision more independent launch solutions of Indian private companies for satellites and other spacecraft in the coming year. The Indian space industry is at a nascent stage and access to cost effective capital for startups will further give impetus to the rapid growth. With the private companies shaping up and increasing productions, there is also a need for holistic skills development which is competency of systems engineering, training on how to operate satellites skillfully, and technology associated with special alloy for launch vehicles.We at the Indian Space Association are hopeful that overall, the combination of technical expertise, favorable government policies, and increasing demand for satellite-based services will make the Indian private space sector a promising area for growth and opportunities in the coming years and are proud of all that we have accomplished and are looking forward to continued growth and success in the coming year.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETTelecom.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

From successful launches and the deployment of satellites to groundbreaking collaborations and the development of new technologies, it has been a year of achievements and exciting milestones.<br><br>The Indian private space sector reached untreaded territory and presented the potential to spur growth and create new opportunities faster than any other developed countries, and the current accomplishments achieved by India’s private space industry are apparent. This is the result of the landmark decision taken by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2020 to open our space industry to the private sector.

The message to create ISRO as the nucleus for the space enterprising activities in India was reiterated by ISRO Chairman and Secretary Department of Space (DoS) Somanath S when he took charge of the organization earlier in January 2022. The space enterprise vision must be collated with apropos policies that support the growth of the private space industry, such as providing financial and regulatory support to private companies and encouraging partnerships between the public and private sectors.<br><br/><div class="in-page-promotions-buckets-featured featured_section_disabled bucket-position-in_page" data-bucket-design="3" data-bucket-id="2" data-bucket-limit="1" data-bucket-position="in_page" data-ftd-callback="inPagePromoCallback" data-ftd-params="design=3&amp;limit=1&amp;entity_type=all&amp;position=in_page&amp;bucket_id=2&amp;rendered_items=0&amp;" data-ftd-type="in-page-promotions" data-type="in-page-promotions" id="in-page-promotions_in_page_1_96564002"><div class="in-page-promotions-buckets hide"></div></div>As we look back at the year 2022, the industry witnessed some major milestones in the growth journey of the private sector with the landmark launch of first private launch vehicle from Skyroot and NSIL authorizing the space conglomerate formed by Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) and HAL a Rs 860-crore contract for the commercial development of next 5 Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLVs) and the pact of OneWeb with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) to launch LEO satellites from India and signing the first license contract with DoT for <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/satellite+broadband">satellite broadband</a> followed by the successful launch of 36 LEO satellites from Sriharikota and NELCO becoming the fourth company to seek GMCPS license to provide satellite broadband services in collaboration with Telesat. Hughes Communications India (HCI), in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), launched its first high throughput satellite (HTS) broadband internet service in the country. Astrome received a grant from DoT for developing the next-gen 5G wireless X-haul gear, GalaxEye won among the 30 most promising space startups of 2022 as per the 11th annual edition of the 'Tech30 Report' by Tech Sparks 2022. Oceansat-3 satellite launched with active contributions of Aidin Technologies, MIL Industries, Ananth Technologies &amp; Kepler Aerospace. Centum Electronics partnered with Rafael -Advanced Defense Systems for indigenous manufacture of electronic warfare systems.

Also, Pixxel launched its third hyperspectral satellite ‘Anand’ for Earth observation applications following the launch of ‘Shakuntala’ earlier this year, Dhruva Space successfully validated its Satellite Orbital Deployer during the PSLV C53 mission and subsequently launched 2 nanosatellites for amateur communications in PSLV C54 using P-dot satellite platform, Digantara built the world’s first commercial space weather sensor, Agnikul Cosmos under the aegis of IN-SPACe established India’s first private space vehicle launch pad at Sriharikota. SpaceKidz's satellite 'FunSat' was successfully launched by Skyroot's Vikram S. Alpha Design Technologies provided ISRO with their first crew module fairing (CMF) structure to protect astronauts for the incumbent Gaganyaan mission. These strides by the startups and young entrepreneurs will encourage technology development in space for defence applications through 75 Defence Space Challenges aka Mission DefSpace launched by Hon’ble PM during DefEXPO 2022.<br/><br/>The establishment of IN-SPACe as a single-window, independent, nodal agency in lieu of Department of Space (DOS) has also benefited the space programme vision. As of December 26, 2022 IN-SPACe has received a total 101 proposals based on category and a total of 396 NGEs have registered on IN-SPACe Digital Platform. The formation of IN-SPACe to handhold and promote the private sector culminated in the breakthrough signing of MoUs between ISRO/IN-SPACe and ISpA Startup members (Agnikul, Astrome, Bellatrix, Dhruva, Digantara, TSC Technologies and Skyroot).<br/><br/>These administrative measures to streamline the advent of private companies in the space sector signify a growing demand for satellite-based services in India, including satellite-based communication, remote sensing, and earth observation. This demand is being driven by the country's expanding economy, population, and infrastructure, as well as by the increasing reliance on technology and the need for more efficient and effective ways to manage natural resources.<br/><br/>The initiatives by the government authorities brought together the industry stakeholder for their suggestions on the new Space Policy, spectrum auctions and licensing framework for establishing satellite earth station gateway and DoTs landmark move on abolishing the NOCC charges which signifies government's continued commitment in supporting the growth of digital communication therefore giving a much-needed push to the spread of satellite communication in the country.<br/><br/>For furthering support to the nascent space industry and to reduce the ‘digital divide’ the government may consider the administrative allocation of spectrum. The sustainable growth of satellite communications in India depends on the harmonization of 28 GHz frequency according to the global standards set by ITU-APT, as the retention of 28 GHz frequency within the space sector will support and help connect the unconnected and provide impetus to local manufacturing &amp; innovation.<br/><br/>The number of space startups in India has already crossed the 100th mark and these startups have raised funding of more than $263.35 million. We expect the new ‘<a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/indian+space+policy">Indian Space Policy</a>’ to be announced early next year which will enable India to likely achieve the capabilities much earlier, as compared to other developed countries like the US. The new ‘Indian Space Policy’ followed by the Space Activity Bill will be a complete game changer which will cover upstream and downstream activities and help formulate vision to bolster the investment climate in the private space sector. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for satellite manufacturing just like the mobile handsets and telecom equipment will further boost the private space ecosystem and help encourage new startups to come up. With the first private launch taking place in India recently we envision more independent launch solutions of Indian private companies for satellites and other spacecraft in the coming year. The Indian space industry is at a nascent stage and access to cost effective capital for startups will further give impetus to the rapid growth. With the private companies shaping up and increasing productions, there is also a need for holistic skills development which is competency of systems engineering, training on how to operate satellites skillfully, and technology associated with special alloy for launch vehicles.<br/><br/>We at the <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/indian+space+association">Indian Space Association</a> are hopeful that overall, the combination of technical expertise, favorable government policies, and increasing demand for satellite-based services will make the Indian private space sector a promising area for growth and opportunities in the coming years and are proud of all that we have accomplished and are looking forward to continued growth and success in the coming year.<br/><br/><em>DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETTelecom.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.
