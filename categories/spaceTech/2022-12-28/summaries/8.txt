Skycorp, Lonestar's space logistics company, has selected Phison to supply the storage for their upcoming 2023 lunar mission, where the 8TB M.2 SSDs must pass NASA TRL-6 certification tests including deep cryogenic temperatures and simulated launching and landing conditions. This is on top of other space missions Phison has been a part of, with extra shielding added to reduce radiation damage risk in its NAND data cells for qualified SSDs.
