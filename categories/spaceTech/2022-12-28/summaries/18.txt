Outpost Technologies has tested a stratospheric paraglider as part of their plan to create a "Cargo Ferry" for safely returning space technology back to Earth and address issues such as the production of space debris, lack of room on the International Space Station, and rising launch costs. The successful test included landing within 5 meters (16 feet) of the target site and further tests are planned in April 2022. Outpost has raised $7 million in funding to develop their venture with hopes it can be used not only on current programs but also future missions beyond 2030.

Outpost Technologies is testing a stratospheric paraglider to bring used space hardware back down to Earth for reflight or examination, with an early-stage contract from NASA on December 6th for their "Cargo Ferry" version. This project aims to not only return hardware like satellites and experiments safely, but help reduce the amount of space debris in Earth's orbit as well.
block 3:  Elizabeth is an post-secondary instructor in communications and science, whose interest in space was triggered by watching the movie Apollo 13 in 1996. She has been discussing various solutions to tackling the issue of space junk, such as using a giant electromagnet or laser beams to redirect them into Earth's atmosphere.
