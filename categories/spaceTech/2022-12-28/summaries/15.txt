A new study reveals that the feathered dinosaur Microraptor, which was the size of a crow and closely linked to the origin of birds, was an opportunistic predator with a generalist diet including fish, birds, lizards and small mammals. This is evidenced by the discovery of a rare fossil containing preserved remains of a small mammal foot inside its body cavity. Of hundreds of carnivorous dinosaur skeletons found only 20 cases have their last meal preserved making this find one of 21 extremely rare occurrences.
