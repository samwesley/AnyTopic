block 1: For South African developers, it’s the perfect time to build AI applications with real-world impact.At Alphawave, a new innovation unit is busy building solutions like Foresight – an “object recognition and motion prediction” platform that turns surveillance cameras into smarter security systems for businesses.The team plans to expand the offering – currently in pilot phase – using innovative ways of predictive analytics as well as cloud computing capabilities.

Alphawave, a South African technology investment group, is investing in five deep tech applications within their innovation units which includes Web3, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and more to promote and support technologies based on scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation - sometimes referred to as 'problem-solving' technology - for organizations globally.

Alphawave, a South African technology investment group, is backing at least five deep tech applications in its innovation units to solve real-world problems with AI. From optimising traffic flow to reducing the cost and environmental impact of waste, predictive insights from machine learning engineers can provide businesses looking for top line growth or cost savings powerful solutions. Their ventures have also extended into space exploration and virtual reality which are both seeing an increase in adoption by businesses and academic institutions. Additionally, agri tech is improving efficiency on farms through smart farming technologies such as GPS tracking for vehicles.
block 3: But AI is becoming much smarter.Unlike the web, it can recognise images and with natural language processing can even form conversations.This has real-world implications as AI can now identify objects in photographs and respond to questions posed by humans without input from a programmer directly coding every single step of each process.In 2021, Alphawave invested in ByteFuse, an AI research and development company that helps companies to build better products, create better customer experiences, and deliver actionable insights – powered by its proprietary predictive analytic platform for businesses of any size or industry.Led by Etienne Barnard (chief executive) and Greg Newman (chief technical officer), this team works on building solutions that help make sense of vast data sets to provide insight into future trends like medical diagnostics models or fraud detection systems – all running reliably on local hardware infrastructure rather than cloud servers

This article discusses the deep technology trends South African entrepreneurs are exploring as well as Alphawave's portfolio companies investing in these technologies such as EMSS Antennas for radio astronomy projects like MeerKAT space texlescope; ByteFuse providing their Artificial Intelligence platforms & Fanfire using blockchain technologies such Web3.

Deep tech is a rapidly evolving field that enables entrepreneurs to solve real-world problems with cutting-edge technology such as AI, space tech, extended and virtual reality, and agritech. Alphawave's portfolio of deep tech ventures are experimental solutions for optimising traffic lights and next-gen chatbots, predictive insights that help restaurants reduce costs and environmental impact of waste, and IoT products for secure livestock tracking.
