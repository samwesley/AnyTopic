The Financial Times reports that organizations including Google and Facebook's parent companies Alphabet and Meta are leading the way in abandoning their leased premises in the two cities. Rising interest rates and an increased desire for home working having made office space less of a requirement and more of a financial burden, and in many cases companies are now seeking to cut their losses by subletting floor space. Google was already planning to move the majority of its staff to a new London base but is now reportedly shutting down its former HQ altogether, as well as looking for tenants for its premises. \"Walk round any of those (big tech) offices and there is a huge amount of space given over to non-fee-generating functions which look very generous,\" Chris Lewis, of property company DeVono Cresa, told the FT. \"The amount of space taken was taken by a really ambitious view of headcount.\" The Times newspaper also reports that over a year ago, Facebook's owner Meta agreed a 20-year lease on a high-profile London office, which was interpreted as a sign of business confidence post-pandemic, but as of December 2022, it remains unoccupied, and it has been confirmed that the company will try to sublet it, a situation that is being repeated at its European headquarters in Dublin, for which the company signed a 25-year lease in 2018. The Techradar website said this follows on from the company subletting a building in Austin, Texas, and terminating the leases on two of its three offices in Manhattan. In recent years the growth of the tech sector has been a safe bet for British property investors, so the drying up of demand will hit landlords particularly hard, when combined with rising interest rates. Aaron Guy, a property analyst at Citi, told the Times that over the next couple of years, London office space value could fall by up to one-third, \"driven primarily by recessionary impacts on higher unemployment and continued work-from-home office shrinkage\". The position of another of the big tech companies, Twitter, remains unclear amid the on-going upheaval caused by its recent takeover by Elon Musk, and significant job cuts and calls for remaining staff to return to offices, but the FT noted that the company's real estate vice-president had recently left the organization. More optimistic news comes from TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. Since September 2022, it has insisted that staff be present in the office two to three days a week. And it is reportedly close to agreeing deals to occupy Verdant, a major new office development in the city of London, and expand its presence in Dublin, which has long been a popular destination for tech companies.", "", "", "", ""], "prompt": [], "summary": [], "blockWordCount": ["3056", "0", "0", "0", "0"]}}, "2": {"title": "Your Coworking Space May Be Killing Your Creativity, Study Finds : ScienceAlert", "link": "https://www.sciencealert.com/your-coworking-space-may-be-killing-your-creativity-study-finds", "html": " ", "article": {"htmlTag": ["p", "article", "id=\"article-body\"", "class_=\"caas-body\"", "itemprop=\"articleBody\""], "block": ["Shared working spaces have boomed in recent years.

A Bowling Green State University senior and pair of graduates are taking complex and often difficult to understand data at NASA and turning it into straightforward visualizations that communicate the important work of the national space agency. BGSU alumnae Morgan Johnson \u201822 and Heather Monaghan \u201817 are graphic designers and illustrators for NASA\u2019s Space Communications and Navigation program. Olivia Francese, a senior, is a 3D modeling intern in the virtual reality Graphics and Visualization Lab at NASA\u2019s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. Collectively, their digital creations have played an essential part in communicating more broadly to the general public the work at NASA and its wide-ranging impact on society while representing BGSU on a global stage. Heather Monaghan Monaghan, who has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in digital arts from BGSU, is based at the organization\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., though she often works remotely. Monaghan and her team at SCaN enable the success of more than 100 NASA and non-NASA missions, including providing communications and navigation support for major missions like the recent Artemis 1 and James Webb Space Telescope. \u201cMy job is to communicate about communications,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have all these different spacecraft, but nobody really thinks about how we send commands to the spacecraft and how we receive data and images from them. I teach people what we do and how all that works.\u201d As a graphic designer and communications specialist, Monaghan creates graphics, illustrations, posters, social media content and infographics to help make the complexity of NASA\u2019s work intelligible \u2013 and fun \u2013 to those outside the science community. Monaghan said educating the public about the essential work at NASA helps inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and astronauts. Some of Monaghan\u2019s outreach efforts have included comic book illustrations and digital spaced-themed Valentine\u2019s Day cards to appeal to younger generations. She said it\u2019s also important to make people aware of the numerous innovations and technological and scientific advancements developed by NASA. \u201cSpace exploration is a lot more than just space exploration, and most people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cSpace exploration enables technology on Earth.\u201d Monaghan said examples of \u201cspinoffs\u201d \u2013 products or innovations developed from space travel \u2013 include camera phones, scratch-resistant lenses, wireless headphones, memory foam, ear thermometers and more. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have things like that without space exploration,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cThere\u2019s amazing, complex science that\u2019s happening at NASA, but it\u2019s pointless if the public doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. We have to excite them.\u201d Morgan Johnson Johnson, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in digital arts and a minor in biology, was recently hired as a graphics lead for the Glenn Research Center SCaN program office after completing four internships at NASA\u2019s Glenn Research Center. In her new full-time role, Johnson said she\u2019ll continue working with project teams at NASA to portray complex processes and technologies through digital art. \u201cThere are so many highly technical people who are so knowledgeable about what they do, but sometimes we need somebody to translate those messages and meet people where they\u2019re at,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe incredible projects at NASA and in Space Communications and Navigation need to be shared in a way that appeals to people and excites them about the work that\u2019s happening here.\u201d A recent project the Kansas, Ohio, native worked on included an animated video and illustration showing how NASA uses artificial intelligence to reroute communication signals between satellites when there\u2019s interference in the atmosphere. \u201cIn a typical communications relay, when a satellite communicates to a ground station to get data back to Earth, we rely on the communication signals having no interference,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen something interferes with those signals, like clouds or bad weather, cognitive communications technology can use artificial intelligence to reroute those communication signals from one satellite to another as another way of getting that information to the ground and back to us.\u201d Olivia Francese Francese, a BGSU senior from Detroit majoring in digital arts, has a slightly different role than Johnson and Monaghan. She works in the Graphics and Visualization Lab at the Glenn Research Center, creating 3D models used in virtual and augmented reality. Francese said the models of testing facilities she receives \u2013 including the equipment, walls, floors and cursory items inside \u2013 lack real-world color information. It\u2019s her job to add textures, light, shadows and reflections to objects to mimic real life. Recently, she\u2019s been working on an aero-testing facility. Francese said she uses reference photos and notes taken during facility tours to guide her visualization. Once complete, the 3D models are imported into software to create a virtual reality experience, allowing the public a view into facilities they may never see otherwise. \u201cNASA has a very technical vocabulary,\u201d Francese said. \u201cI\u2019m able to take that and visually communicate to the public about what NASA is doing.\u201d Francese works full time as an intern for NASA and is a part-time student at the University. She works remotely for NASA other than Fridays when she travels from Bowling Green to the NASA office in Cleveland. From BGSU to NASA Monaghan was the first of the three Falcons to work at NASA. She interned as a designer and illustrator at the Glenn Research Center in 2018 following her graduation in 2017. Monaghan returned to NASA full time in 2020 and soon after received a message from Johnson, who learned of her experiences when a professor in a digital painting class at BGSU used her art as an example. Johnson reached out to Monaghan for advice on getting an internship at NASA. Monaghan connected Johnson with her current mentor, Molly Kearns, a digital media specialist at NASA, who offered her a shadowing internship in the summer of 2021. Three more internships followed throughout 2021 and 2022. Then, in a pay-it-forward type of moment, Johnson gave a presentation on her internship to the BGSU graphic design club, and Francese was there. The two connected after the presentation, and Johnson put Francese in touch with the right people at NASA, similar to how Monaghan helped her. \u201cI was really fortunate to have met Heather, which ultimately led me to my now full-time career at NASA, and it felt great to be able to do the same for Olivia,\u201d Johnson said. For Monaghan, helping fellow Falcons find success at NASA has been among the most rewarding parts of her career. \u201cIt was this really cool moment of \u2018that used to be me.\u2019 I was the person cold emailing people, asking questions and picking people\u2019s brains,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m able to extend that help to other people, and the fact that they are fellow Falcons makes it even more rewarding.\u201d Quality public education The three women each lauded their quality public education at BGSU and the role it played in preparing them to work at the world\u2019s leading space institution. Monaghan, an out-of-state transfer student, said she arrived at the University with little confidence in her work. Through her classes and with help from attentive professors, she said she slowly started to see herself as an artist. \u201cI had the most wonderful professors who constantly encouraged me and pushed me,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cAt BGSU, the experience of having to constantly present your work and talk about it has been incredibly helpful for me. It was the hardest thing at the time, but that\u2019s basically what I have to do every day now.\u201d Johnson\u2019s decision to minor in biology proved to be incredibly beneficial to her work at NASA. Although she acknowledged biology is not directly related to digital art or space, she said the ability to break down complicated scientific topics into easy-to-understand graphics has been crucial to her success. \u201cIn college, I was always thinking about these complex scientific topics and my own ways to translate them into artwork,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was really helpful to have that experience of taking something that was super complex and showing it visually. That definitely translates to what I do here when working with engineers and scientists.\u201d Francese enrolled at BGSU with plans to pursue digital illustration. That changed after taking an introduction to 3D modeling class. \u201cI just fell in love with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized this is what I want to do.\u201d", "\n\n\n\nHome  News  BGSU senior, graduates communicate importance of space exploration at NASA\nNews\n\nBGSU senior, graduates communicate importance of space exploration at NASA\nBy BGSU Marketing & Communications\n\nBy Staff Reports -   January 2, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp\n\n\n\nBGSU alumnae Morgan Johnson \u201822 is a graphic designer and illustrator for NASA\u2019s Space Communications and Navigation program.\nA Bowling Green State University senior and pair of graduates are taking complex and often difficult to understand data at NASA and turning it into straightforward visualizations that communicate the important work of the national space agency.\nBGSU alumnae Morgan Johnson \u201822 and Heather Monaghan \u201817 are graphic designers and illustrators for NASA\u2019s Space Communications and Navigation program.

Australia, and Canada are set to impose restrictions on travellers from China in the wake of spike in Covid-19 cases. So far, more than a dozen countries and territories have imposed similar measures on travellers from China due to significant wave of Covid-19 infections in the country. Australia and Canada mandates negative Covid-19 test results for all passengers travelling from mainland China, including the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Effective from 5 January 2022, travellers to Australia will be required to show negative results for Covid-19 tests taken within the 48hrs prior to travel. Australian Health Minister Mark Butler said: \u201cWhile we are no longer in the emergency phase of the pandemic response in Australia, this decision has been made to safeguard Australia from the risk of potential new emerging variants, and in recognition of the rapidly evolving situation in China and uncertainty about emerging viral variants.\u201d Butler said that the new precautionary and temporary arrangements will be under review based on available information and the health advice. Furthermore, Canada requires negative COVID-19 test results for air travellers two years of age and older. This new 30-day measure is effective from 05 January. In a press statement, the government said: \u201cIn response to the surge of COVID-19 in the People\u2019s Republic of China and given the limited epidemiological and viral genomic sequence data available on these cases, the Government of Canada intends to put in place certain temporary health measures for air travellers entering Canada from China.\u201d \n\t\tThe leading site for news and procurement in the airport industry \n\t\t\t\tPowered by\n\t\t\t\t\n \u00a9 Verdict Media Limited 2023", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nSchiphol starts major maintenance works at Zwanenburgbaan Runway\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nWork on India\u2019s Noida Airport reaches 20% completion\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nUS calls for probe into Southwest Airlines meltdown\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nAir India Express, AirAsia prepare for merger\n\n", "", "", ""], "prompt": [], "summary": [], "blockWordCount": ["1811", "279", "0", "0", "0"]}}, "5": {"title": "Startups set to go to space for the first time on SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-6 mission \u2022 TechCrunch", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/02/startups-spacex-transporter-6-mission/", "html": " ", "article": {"htmlTag": ["p", "article", "id=\"article-body\"", "class_=\"caas-body\"", "itemprop=\"articleBody\""], "block": ["SpaceX is poised to launch 114 payloads to orbit on a Falcon 9 tomorrow morning, the sixth mission of its smallsat rideshare program.

You spin me right round: Picture, in your mind\u2019s eye, a space settlement, the dream of the Bezos and Musks of the world. If you watch enough scifi, you likely envision a rotating mass, whose constant, precisely controlled motion creates simulated gravity for its denizens. Such a moving metropolis is called an \u201cO\u2019Neill cylinder,\u201d named for physicist Gerard O\u2019Neill, who designed them at the bequest of NASA in the 1970s. Since its conception, the O\u2019Neill cylinder has since become among the most popular of space city ideas, popping up in numerous science fiction pieces and even being touted by the current figures of the new space age. (Jeff Bezos touted their use, drawing a humorous rebuke from Elon Musk, who deemed the idea \u201clike trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d) One of the largest hurdles to creating O\u2019Neill cylinders would be the sheer cost of their construction. Getting the building materials \u2014 and labor \u2014 from Earth to space would be exceedingly expensive. A partial solution could be building an asteroid city, taking advantage of the rocky bodies already out there, building upon them, and then setting them spinning. \u201cAll those flying mountains whirling around the sun might provide a faster, cheaper, and more effective path to space cities,\u201d Frank said. Their abundance and rock layer, which could protect from space radiation, further make an asteroid city an attractive candidate. But the team found a problem with this plan too when they ran the math: the asteroids will break apart well before they hit the speeds needed to keep our feet on the ground. And on top of that, most asteroids are less \u201cchunk of rock\u201d than \u201cloosely assembled pile of rocks.\u201d Their answer: a giant bag. Specifically, a giant, flexible, and lightweight mesh bag made from carbon nanofibers.   In the bag: Frank and fellow U of R colleagues and students Peter Miklav\u010di\u010d, Alice Quillen, John Siu, Esteban Wright, Alex Debrecht, and Hesam Askari decided to turn their attention to the problem while locked down for COVID-19. \u201cThis project started as just a way for physicists and engineers to blow off steam, set aside worldly stresses for a while, and imagine something crazy,\u201d Miklav\u010di\u010d, the study\u2019s first author, said. By running the math on the various forces and material necessary for building an asteroid city with different techniques, they hit on a possible \u2014 albeit science-fantastical \u2014 solution. Their answer, published in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences (frontiers indeed!), is a giant bag. Specifically, a giant, flexible, and lightweight mesh bag made from carbon nanofibers \u2014 tubes only a few atoms in diameter \u2014 each with a strength that belies their small size.  \u201cA cylindrical containment bag constructed from carbon nanotubes would be extremely light relative to the mass of the asteroid rubble and the habitat, yet strong enough to hold everything together,\u201d Miklav\u010di\u010d said. And carbon nanotubes are currently being developed in labs around the world with an eye to scale, Miklav\u010di\u010d noted. The idea may look something like this: You cover the asteroid in the bag. You set the asteroid spinning to create gravity. The bag catches the rubble being flung off as a result, creating a layer of rock thick enough to protect from radiation, and you\u2019ve got yourself a set up for your asteroid city. Easy, right? \u201cBased on our calculations, a 300-meter-diameter asteroid just a few football fields across could be expanded into a cylindrical space habitat with about 22 square miles of living area,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat\u2019s roughly the size of Manhattan.\u201d \u201cOur paper lives on the edge of science and science fiction.\u201d Futurist speculation: Of course, all of this is so far down the pike that it\u2019s difficult to imagine as anything other than fantasy.

As an attendee, people will be amazed by innovations in artificial intelligence technology, virtual reality, robotics and consumer technology products filled with the latest transformative technologies, as well as new categories: NFT, food technology, space technology and more. \nThe International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), sponsored by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), is considered the Super Bowl of global consumer electronics and consumer technology and is the international consumer technology show. A gathering place for those who thrive in the industry.\n The International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), sponsored by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), is considered the Super Bowl of global consumer electronics and consumer technology and is the international consumer technology show. A gathering place for those who thrive in the industry. This time, EMEET is exhibiting again at CES, and it is evident that the algorithm and software behind it can improve the user experience and efficiency of consumer electronics. These algorithms, software and products are integrated, optimizing the user experience in places where users cannot perceive. The advancement of artificial intelligence technology determines the extent to which they can \"humanize\" care or respond to human needs and commands so that users can feel the temperature of technology to the greatest extent. It is known that EMEET will continue focusing on its flagship product at this CES exhibition and will also give consumers a comprehensive understanding of it from the appearance, function, and design concept behind it. This flagship product is EMEET Meeting Capsule. This product is an All-in-one high-end conference device integrating an exclusive brilliant 360\u00b0 flip lens, 8-microphone array, Hi-Fi speakers and exclusive audio and video algorithms, aiming to provide a perfect one-stop-shop for online/remote conference solutions. From the appearance, the flip camera subverts the proportion and shape of the traditional conference all-in-one device. It creates a simple and technologically integrated form with the ultimate subtractive design. The overall body is slender, and the upper part is equipped with an innovative flip camera to facilitate the presentation of 360\u00b0 panorama strips; the lower part is the speaker cavity, and the textures are full of metal technology. Also, it has three changeable lens modes, and the three lenses correspond to five conference modes. It is easy to find that EMEET's products contain the design concept behind them. The three lenses and five modes are set in consideration of the needs of various groups of people. The 360\u00b0 meeting panorama bar, AI portrait tracking and image presentation also consider the inability to accurately identify the speaker in today's remote meetings, which makes the meeting lack some real sense of participation, etc. After considering many humanistic factors, EMEET combines its software algorithms to integrate all of them into one product, constantly examines products from the perspective of users, and continuously optimizes the user experience. Upcoming Product: EMEET Meeting Capsule Pro There is not too much information on the Meeting Capsule Pro just yet, but based on current information, the Meeting Capsule Pro not only has all the key features from the Meeting Capsule but more. Some new features include: There are more brand new features that haven't been said, but let's save the best for the CES 2023. Upcoming Product: EMEET StreamCam One EMEET's first ever self-created streaming camera is suitable for various streaming platforms such as Facebook Live, Twitch, Youtube Live, Twitter, Linkedin, etc. Three cameras can be bluetooth connected and display 3 different angles at once. Stream your story anywhere with the EMEET StreamCam One. More key features will be displayed at CES 2023. The CES event will open soon, and EMEET will head back to Las Vegas again with a much larger booth and more advanced technology and products to showcase to the world. Driving change in essential areas, challenging the status quo, driving innovation, and providing multi-scenario conference solutions, is the way EMEET is moving forward.

The most significant feature of these two modes is that the lower half of the screen will present a panorama of the meeting room, and the speaker's image will also appear on the upper half of the screen. This is EMEET's exclusive AI algorithm, which is captured and presented perfectly according to the sound. Animate the face of the speaker so that the remote team on the other end can see their face immediately, recreating the face-to-face interaction for an immersive meeting experience.\nWhen the camera is facing forward, that is, when the camera is 180\u00b0, the corresponding conference modes are classic and lecturer modes. The classic mode uses a 180\u00b0 angle of view to restoring the scene of the current meeting truly; the speaker mode can be understood as a \"selfie angle of view\". Although the lens is 180\u00b0, in the speaker mode, the angle is only 60\u00b0. Users will see a little background of themselves and behind them, which is convenient for them to communicate with others without being disturbed by the surrounding environment.\nWhen the lens is facing down, that is, when the lens is at 0\u00b0, the corresponding mode at this time is the privacy mode. In this mode, the other party cannot hear the voice and image on user's side, which is suitable for the intermission of large meetings.\nIt is easy to find that EMEET's products contain the design concept behind them.

He warned that if China prevails, it may claim ownership of territory on the moon. Former astronaut and Florida senator Bill Nelson, the administrator of NASA, told Politico that if China first establishes a foothold on the moon, they may cordon off the most resource-rich portions of the lunar surface.  \u201cIt is a fact: we\u2019re in a space race,\u201d he told the outlet.  He further stated that the US should watch out that Beijing doesn\u2019t get to a place on the moon under the premise of conducting a scientific study, and it is not beyond the horizon of possibilities that they say, \u201cKeep out, we\u2019re here, this is our land.\u201d Nelson continued by bringing up China\u2019s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, where the Chinese government frequently asserts its sovereignty over territories that belong to other nations. Nelson\u2019s critical remarks come after NASA\u2019s 26-day Artemis I mission, during which an unmanned Orion spacecraft circled the moon. Widely viewed as a success, the mission represented the first significant step in NASA\u2019s ambition to send astronauts to the moon in 2025.  The aggressive space program of China, which recently saw the debut of a new space station, is becoming a severe threat to the US. Beijing has stated that it hopes to land taikonauts on the moon before the end of this decade.  In December, China\u2019s government announced its plans for more ambitious projects, including creating a space governance system and building space infrastructure. Meanwhile, the US space agency has been working on its Artemis series of lunar missions. Nevertheless, the US program could risk falling behind the Chinese if there are substantial setbacks or delays because it depends on several novel systems and apparatuses still under development.  High-ranking US officials have repeatedly cautioned in recent years that China\u2019s Space capabilities are developing rapidly, posing significant challenges to American supremacy in outer space. In November 2022, the US Space Force\u2019s director of staff, Nina Armagno, stated that Beijing had made substantial strides in developing military space technology, particularly in fields like satellite communications and reusable spacecraft, which enable nations to build up their space programs quickly. \u201cI think it\u2019s entirely possible they could catch up and surpass us, absolutely. The progress they\u2019ve made has been stunning, stunningly fast,\u201d Armagno said at an event hosted by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. A Pentagon report also highlighted recent advancements in the Chinese space program. It noted China\u2019s innovative capacity to land on the far side of the moon and establish a communications relay using a satellite between the Earth and the moon. The report discovered that China is improving at producing space launch systems to enable more human space exploration. The communist government in China, however, insists that these concerns regarding its motives are baseless. Chinese Embassy in Washington spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement that certain American officials had talked carelessly to disparage China\u2019s routine and legitimate space endeavors. \u201cChina firmly rejects such remarks,\u201d he added. Exploration and peaceful applications of outer space are a shared human endeavor that should benefit all, Pengyu noted.  He said that China consistently promotes the peaceful use of space, opposes the militarization and space weapons race, and actively seeks to establish a space community with a shared future for humanity. Nevertheless, Nelson expressed assurance that the American mission to return to the moon first is proceeding according to plan, pointing out that the Artemis program has congressional funding. Congress authorized $24.5 billion for NASA in fiscal 2023, approximately half of what President Joe Biden sought.  He stated that the next lunar trip, Artemis II, will take place \u201cwithin two years\u201d and that \u201chopefully, we can accelerate it.\u201d That mission plan calls for sending a crew into lunar orbit by 2024.  However, he revealed that the space agency is under severe pressure because it has been compelled, as a cost-cutting measure, to reuse all of the avionics within the Artemis I capsule for Artemis II. The latest remarks from the head of NASA show how China and the US are vying for access to the moon\u2019s abundant resources in an increasingly competitive contest. Copyright \u00a92021.

Both sides were right. The university had equipped the space with large trestle tables that seated six people, but it turned out that if just one person was sitting at a table nobody else would. The solution: Place houseplants in the middle of the table to divide the space and create a perception of privacy. In short, the space plan looked good on paper but didn\u2019t account for human behavior. That\u2019s a bug Boston-based Lambent is hoping to fix. Thanks to mobile phones, smart cameras and Wi-Fi, it\u2019s now possible for organizations to gather fine-grained anonymous data about how space is used to inform smarter planning decisions. Lambent, where Lord is chief technology officer, is out to apply machine learning to the process. There\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. A recent survey the company conducted found that 75% of space planners believe people ask for more space than they need and 90% of senior leaders say they don\u2019t have the data they need to make smart decisions about space planning. \u201cIt\u2019s not about reducing the amount of space that we have,\u201d Lord said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that that space fits what employees or students need from it.\u201d Lambent, which is the business name of Armored Things Inc., shifted its strategy from public safety to data-driven space planning in the wake of the pandemic. Launched in 2017, the company initially set out to apply analytics to crowd control but it discovered that the bigger opportunity was in the more prosaic area of helping businesses create more efficient workplaces. \u201cIt\u2019s the same core technology under the covers, but it is now being applied to a very different set of problems,\u201d Lord said. \u201cPeople who manage spaces need more than just an understanding of how many people are in an area. They need to understand how that relates to how that space is used.\u201d COVID-19 complicated the picture. Businesses and universities have struggled to understand what the long-term impacts of social distancing and remote work will be on the workplace. Lambent\u2019s survey found that 86% of corporate space planners believe managing a return to work has been a challenge. Failure to gather data creates inefficiency and waste. For example, businesses often allocate ample space for conference rooms but don\u2019t check back late on how that space is used. \u201cThey need to look at how many people are in the conference room relative to capacity,\u201d Lord said. \u201cIf people are popping in just to take a phone call, then that\u2019s an ineffective use of space.\u201d A better solution in that scenario would be to install small phone booth-like spaces where one or two people could take a call. Lambent is applying machine learning to analyze data culled from devices that permeate the workplace and passively track the whereabouts of people. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking those small signals sprinkled across the space, fusing them together and turning them into that big-picture understanding of how many people are there,\u201d he said. Lambent says one university customer used the platform to analyze its use of centrally scheduled instructional computer labs and determined that nine of the labs could be replaced by virtual learning experiences, saving $2 million in rent over the next several years. Machine learning can make intelligent predictions about where people are even if their devices aren\u2019t visible. \u201cYou can infer where people are based on where you\u2019ve seen them in the spaces where you have coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data comes from instrumentation that lives in the environment already. We call it \u2018dark data\u2019 and in most cases, nothing is being done with it.\u201d Analytics can not only improve space efficiency but influence workplace practices. For example, knowing that people are more likely to come into the office for meetings rather than to work at a desk can guide decisions about how to allocate collaboration space. Empty offices on Mondays and Fridays caused by people extending their weekends may prompt a company to offer incentives such as pizza parties on those days. \u201cThe more advanced customers care about pulling people into the office, giving them a reason to come in\u201d and not demanding what days they should be there, Lord said. Simply observing behavior or scrutinizing conference room reservations can be misleading. \u201cUsing poor signals is going to inform the wrong actions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that the conference room was booked, but not if it was booked for the capacity it can handle.\u201d Lambent says its platform aggregates data across a portfolio of spaces the organization controls and pulls it into a single view that can be filtered across time periods, space types or tags to make it easier to track the metrics that matter. The most advanced companies are rethinking the whole idea of fixed workplace design, Lord said. \u201cThey want to get to a point where spaces are not big capital assets that you invest in once,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are malleable depending on what you need this month or this quarter and what the teams and the projects demand.\u201d Click here to join the free and open Startup Showcase event.

CMOs are hoping to grow outsourcing to significantly higher levels in many different areas, with a focus on analytical testing, toxicity testing, and fill/finish operations. Outsourcing has become a crucial part of the biopharmaceutical industry, with many contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) being the only facilities with the ability to produce vaccines and therapies in the vast volumes requested. Other reasons for outsourcing include the need to control costs/minimize internal staff and resources, getting a product out to the market in an efficient way, and having no alternative ways to complete manufacturing capabilities (1). For the near future, CMOs are hoping to grow outsourcing to significantly higher levels in many different areas, with a focus on analytical testing,toxicity testing, and fill/finish operations. In addition to these predictions, CMOs are already making shifts in their operations to have more options and advanced services (1). An example of this is how many sponsor companies are heading toward contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) service agreements to further improve their processes. In October 2022, Societal CDMO entered two new contract development and manufacturing service agreements, which will provide an array of analytical method, technical transfer, formulation, manufacturing, and packaging services for novel therapeutics (2). The first contract focuses on services such as analytical method development and validation, technical transfer combined with formulation optimization, clinical trial batch manufacturing, and primary packaging for the drug. Meanwhile, the second contract targets on Societal CDMO\u2019s services like formulation development, analytical method transfer and verification, and good manufacturing practice (GMP) batch manufacturing and fill/finish (2). Other companies are focused on expanding their CDMO services for parenteral drugs to customers outside of the United States. For example, Terumo Pharmaceutical Solutions is set to offer end-to-end services with pre-filled syringes (PFS) design, molding, drug preparation, filling, assembly, and final packaging for biotech drugs and small molecules (3). Additionally, the services would include early development stage to large-scale commercial production for global pharmaceutical customers, such as assembly of PFS with devices such as autoinjectors and needle safety devices (3). With the ever-changing state of CDMOs, acquisitions are continuing to occur for the overall better development of the pharmaceutical industry (4). Kindeva Drug Delivery, a CDMO, acquired iPharma Labs, which is a CDMO focused on inhaled medicines, in June 2022. iPharma comes from a specialization background in inhalation formulation and the development of liquid, dry powder, and propellant-based therapies and has worked with dry powder inhalation, soft mist inhalers, and nebulizers for both small and large molecules in the earlier stages of drug development (4). Catalent has also completed the expansion of its clinical supply facility in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in Shangai, China. The expansion has allowed for installation of additional refrigerated and deep-frozen storage, including the development of secondary packaging capabilities (5). As new facilities begin to open, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s opening of a new facility in Hangzhou, China, more companies are aimed to be at the forefront of boosting biologics, sterile development, manufacturing capabilities, and more. In addition to offering integrated clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product capabilities, the company plans to feature commercial packaging and labeling capabilities in the near future (6). The expansion of new facilities calls for an effort on new investments to better manufacture products. For example, Recipharm announced it would be advancing their CDMO with a new high-speed filling line for pre-filled syringes and cartridges at one of their sterile manufacturing facilities in Germany. The line will be fully Annex 1 compliant and designed to support both small- and large-volume projects (7). As for trends in outsourcing strategies, the latest CPHI report predicts that a significant shift in outsourcing strategies is being experienced globally, with innovators planning out a product\u2019s full lifecycle as early as the pre-clinical stage (8). A key finding in the report found that \u201cpharma-ready\u201d synthetic routes are being planned much earlier in the development process, whereas \u201cphase-appropriate development\u201d is believed to be an outdated approach specifically when dealing with accelerated pathways. Further, the report mentioned that innovators will need to decide on using asingle end-to-end provider or a multi-provider model, and CDMOs need to reevaluate their approaches to development and marketing (8). Through single-use/disposable systems, advanced therapeutics/cell and gene therapy technologies, continuous bioprocessing, and other differentiated bioprocessing services, the future of biopharmaceutical CMOs is set to emerge into multiple markets to increase productivity and cut costs (1). 1.

Sebastian, like many others, was responding to the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the spotlight it shined on persistent racial inequality. He asked Motley to join with him and technology innovator Kelauni Jasmyn to launch a Black-led venture to create change. In addition to their concern over race and social issues, the three also came together over another initiative \u2014 one that Jasmyn began in 2016. Jasmyn is the founder and CEO of Black Tech Nation, a Pittsburgh-based education and advocacy group that works to bring Black people into the tech industry. Imagined, initially, as sort of a Saturday morning meet-up for tech nerds, once Jasmyn joined Motley and Sebastian, the group eventually created Black Tech Nation Ventures, a $50 million venture capital fund that invests in African American and diverse technology startups. \u201cWe know that ideas don\u2019t have color,\u201d says Jasmyn, \u201cso the goal is to open up a space in tech for Black people and the Black community and create more opportunities.\u201d Black Tech Nation Ventures in its first year has drawn investors that include Carnegie Mellon University, Bank of America, First National Bank, Mastercard, the Pittsburgh Pirates and Mark Cuban as it seeks to not only find and fund emerging Black tech talent, but also to recruit and nurture other Black professionals into the venture capital funder space. It also seeks to diversify the geography of venture capital influence and not have it all be centered in Silicon Valley. At its core, the trio sees Black Tech Nation Ventures as an engine of Black and diverse generational wealth creation, an opportunity to invest in communities that have been left out and underrepresented. Much of this began with Jasmyn. She graduated from Howard University with a pre-medicine degree and then decided she didn\u2019t want to be a physician. She worked as a teacher and lived for a while in Los Angeles, New York, Spain and parts of Africa. As she considered next steps for building a career, a colleague\u2019s idea to try tech intrigued her. \u201cJust being a Black woman in tech, and the opportunity to make six figures in your first job,\u201d she says, \u201csounded good to me.\u201d An opportunity to train in a three-month tech bootcamp, Academy of Pittsburgh, brought her to the city in 2016. Her plan was to learn coding and find a path to Google. However, the immersion into tech exposed Jasmyn to the digital divide, the racial and economic gap that limits access to computers and careers in the tech industry. As she went around town to events and programs, she says she was often the only Black person in the room. \u201cWE\u2019RE ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR WEAKEST LINKS, SO THE GOAL IS TO WORK HARD TO CREATE BETTER SPACES FOR EVERYONE TO WIN, REGARDLESS OF RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION.\u201d \u2013 KELAUNI JASMYN Transformational Wealth In search of community, she founded the nonprofit Black Tech Nation. It quickly grew, reaching people in Denver, Seattle, South Africa, etc. Parents wanted their children involved, tech veterans wanted a home and tech newbies wanted a safe space to network and build careers. Black Tech Nation, which now has more than 2,000 members and supporters, positioned itself as a \u201cdigital Wakanda\u201d and began to host forums for Black professionals to build awareness of and address the digital divide. The energy of the advocacy caught the attention of Sebastian, who moved to Pittsburgh 25 years ago to found Birchmere Ventures here. Since then, it has invested in more than 100 companies, about a quarter of them with significant diversity in their leadership teams. He became the first to invest in Black Tech Nation because he says he believed the work was relevant to the moment \u2014 and that supporting it would be a way to diversify the industry and create \u201ctransformational wealth\u201d for diverse communities. Sebastian, like Jasmyn, also knew that in trying to bring capital and access to African Americans they would need to scale beyond the limitations of a nonprofit. Sebastian, using his business \u201cmuscle memory\u201d and experience of working with a diverse portfolio, would mentor Jasmyn, showing her how to launch a fund. In spring of 2021, along with Motley, they co-founded Black Tech Nation Ventures. The diversity of the trio \u2014 a mashup of race, gender, generational and professional experiences \u2014 and their varied interests are large parts of what fuels the venture. \u201cWe\u2019re the most unlikely group ever,\u201d says Jasmyn.  \u201cWe laugh about it, but it\u2019s what makes it work.\u201d Jasymn is an African American millennial who grew up in an underserved community on the outskirts of Chicago. Although she\u2019s an outsider to Pittsburgh, she\u2019s energized a community of Black techies here. Motley says he readily came onboard. He is a Pittsburgh native who grew up in the city\u2019s East End. After earning a degree in engineering from the University of Pittsburgh, he earned an MBA from Harvard and founded the African American Directors Forum, a project that seeks to increase the representation of Blacks on public company boards nationally. He\u2019s been able to leverage the talents and resources of a broad network of Black professionals to aid the venture. Sebastian is from Washington, D.C., and has lived here for decades. Though he\u2019s white, he is aware of tech\u2019s lack of diversity and is an ally in wanting to make it more inclusive and progress beyond it being \u201cYale, pale, male and stale.\u201d \u201cPITTSBURGH\u2019S RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND ITS POOL OF TALENTED PEOPLE ENABLES POTENTIALLY POWERFUL CONNECTIONS THAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IN BIGGER CITIES.\u201d \u2013 DAVID MOTLEY The Right Timing As Pittsburgh\u2019s new economy was being heralded as one of medicine, business and education, technology was increasingly becoming a part of the conversation. \u201cI came at the right time, making the right noise,\u201d Jasmyn says, a time when the city, foundations and others were able and willing to invest in making the city more inclusive for all. It didn\u2019t hurt, says Motley, that \u201cPittsburgh\u2019s relatively small size and its pool of talented people enables potentially powerful connections that might not happen in bigger cities.\u201d As it pushes toward a goal of being a top-tier firm, so far, Black Tech Nation Ventures has a portfolio that includes support of three startups in the financial tech and education tech space. These include Boston-based BrightUp and Hive Wealth, in Washington, D.C.; founded by African American women, both are devoted to closing racial wealth gaps. There\u2019s also BlendEd, a company based in Cleveland, that is headed by a Black man. It is developing an open-source educational platform to help cultivate world-class learning at community colleges. Black Tech Nation Ventures is also working to close its first deal with a Pittsburgh business with a Latina founder; it also has made an undisclosed investment in a diverse-led Pittsburgh-based company. While it is a national fund, the founders hope to invest about 25% of its portfolio in Pittsburgh-based companies with investments ranging from $250,000 to $1 million. THERE IS THE DEEP SATISFACTION OF \u201cKNOWING THAT YOU MADE POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE THAT JUST HAVEN\u2019T HAD A FAIR SHOT, WHO HAVEN\u2019T BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THE ROOM. AND THAT FEELS GOOD.\u201d \u2013 SEAN SEBASTIAN The Psyche Reward As they build toward a portfolio of 30 investments, the trio will evaluate strategies that support health care tech and what it calls culture-based markets, aiming toward tech-enabled businesses that provide solutions for specific groups of people, such as Black women and hair care. It also is fulfilling its mission of seeking diversity at every level. It is supported by an all-female legal team and a Black accounting firm and uses other diverse providers. The fund is based Downtown in a co-working space known as Emerald City, which is owned and managed by African American women. According to Jasmyn, Black Tech Nation Ventures is the only Black-owned fund over $50 million in Pittsburgh. By and large, Jasmyn and her partners are in good company. Other Black venture capitalists have recently started new firms: In 2018, Adeyemi Ajao raised $137 million to kick start his Base10 Partners firm, making it the most well-funded venture capital account led by a Black founder. That same year, Sarah Kunst raised $3.5 million to launch Cleo Capital, which at the time was the second-largest debut by a Black woman-led venture capital fund, according to The Plug, a Black tech news and insights platform on Bloomberg. In 2014, tennis champion Serena Williams formed Serena Ventures, a project reported to have raised $111 million. An analysis by The Plug found that the median investment amount for Black women-led venture capital funds is $3.3 million. As it moves forward, says Sebastian, the fund is striving to be financially successful, and then the trio can aim at what he calls the \u201cpsyche reward,\u201d the deep satisfaction of \u201cknowing that you made possible opportunities for people that just haven\u2019t had a fair shot, who haven\u2019t been able to get in the room. And that feels good.\u201d The three believe the city has a way to go to address some structural issues, but Black Tech Nation and the venture capital fund can help bring some national attention to Pittsburgh and the contributions of people of color. \u201cWe\u2019re only as strong as our weakest links,\u201d says Jasmyn, \u201cso the goal is to work hard to create better spaces for everyone to win, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.\u201d Ervin Dyer is a Pittsburgh-based writer who covers Africana life and culture. \u00a9 2023 Pittsburgh Magazine.", " \nMod Squad: Meet The People Behind Pittsburgh\u2019s Black Tech Nation Ventures\nA trio of diverse innovators launched a $50 million tech venture fund to empower Black and inclusive startups.\n\n\n14 hours ago\n\n\n\nErvin Dyer, \nPhotos by Huck Beard, \n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2020, businessman David Motley received a call from his friend, Sean Sebastian, a Pittsburgh investor and financial consultant.

It also is fulfilling its mission of seeking diversity at every level.\nIt is supported by an all-female legal team and a Black accounting firm and uses other diverse providers. The fund is based Downtown in a co-working space known as Emerald City, which is owned and managed by African American women.\nAccording to Jasmyn, Black Tech Nation Ventures is the only Black-owned fund over $50 million in Pittsburgh.\nBy and large, Jasmyn and her partners are in good company. Other Black venture capitalists have recently started new firms: In 2018, Adeyemi Ajao raised $137 million to kick start his Base10 Partners firm, making it the most well-funded venture capital account led by a Black founder. That same year, Sarah Kunst raised $3.5 million to launch Cleo Capital, which at the time was the second-largest debut by a Black woman-led venture capital fund, according to The Plug, a Black tech news and insights platform on Bloomberg.\nIn 2014, tennis champion Serena Williams formed Serena Ventures, a project reported to have raised $111 million. An analysis by The Plug found that the median investment amount for Black women-led venture capital funds is $3.3 million.\nAs it moves forward, says Sebastian, the fund is striving to be financially successful, and then the trio can aim at what he calls the \u201cpsyche reward,\u201d the deep satisfaction of \u201cknowing that you made possible opportunities for people that just haven\u2019t had a fair shot, who haven\u2019t been able to get in the room.

Space solar power provides a way to tap into the practically unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space, where the energy is constantly available without being subjected to the cycles of day and night, seasons, and cloud cover. The launch, currently slated for early January, represents a major milestone in the project and promises to make what was once science fiction a reality. When fully realized, SSPP will deploy a constellation of modular spacecraft that collect sunlight, transform it into electricity, then wirelessly transmit that electricity over long distances wherever it is needed\u2014including to places that currently have no access to reliable power. A Momentus Vigoride spacecraft carried aboard a SpaceX rocket on the Transporter-6 mission will carry the 50-kilogram SSPD to space. It consists of three main experiments, each tasked with testing a different key technology of the project: An additional fourth component of SSPD is a box of electronics that interfaces with the Vigoride computer and controls the three experiments. SSPP got its start in 2011 after philanthropist Donald Bren, chairman of Irvine Company and a lifetime member of the Caltech Board of Trustees, learned about the potential for space-based solar energy manufacturing in an article in the magazine Popular Science. Intrigued by the potential for space solar power, Bren approached Caltech's then-president Jean-Lou Chameau to discuss the creation of a space-based solar power research project. In 2013, Bren and his wife, Brigitte Bren, a Caltech trustee, agreed to make the donation to fund the project. The first of the donations (which will eventually exceed $100 million) was made that year through the Donald Bren Foundation, and the research began. \"For many years, I've dreamed about how space-based solar power could solve some of humanity's most urgent challenges,\" Bren says. \"Today, I'm thrilled to be supporting Caltech's brilliant scientists as they race to make that dream a reality.\" The rocket will take approximately 10 minutes to reach its desired altitude. The Momentus spacecraft will then be deployed from the rocket into orbit. The Caltech team on Earth plans to start running their experiments on the SSPD within a few weeks of the launch. Some elements of the test will be conducted quickly. \"We plan to command the deployment of DOLCE within days of getting access to SSPD from Momentus. We should know right away if DOLCE works,\" says Sergio Pellegrino, Caltech's Joyce and Kent Kresa Professor of Aerospace and Professor of Civil Engineering and co-director of SSPP. Pellegrino is also a senior research scientist at JPL, which Caltech manages for NASA. Other elements will require more time. The collection of photovoltaics will need up to six months of testing to give new insights into what types of photovoltaic technology will be best for this application. MAPLE involves a series of experiments, from an initial function verification to an evaluation of the performance of the system under different environments over time. Meanwhile, two cameras on deployable booms mounted on DOLCE and additional cameras on the electronics box will monitor the experiment's progress, and stream a feed back down to Earth. The SSPP team hopes that they will have a full assessment of the SSPD's performance within a few months of the launch. Numerous challenges remain: nothing about conducting an experiment in space\u2014from the launch to the deployment of the spacecraft to the operation of the SSPD\u2014is guaranteed. But regardless of what happens, the sheer ability to create a space-worthy prototype represents a significant achievement by the SSPP team. \"No matter what happens, this prototype is a major step forward,\" says Ali Hajimiri, Caltech's Bren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering and co-director of SSPP. \"It works here on Earth, and has passed the rigorous steps required of anything launched into space. There are still many risks, but having gone through the whole process has taught us valuable lessons. We believe the space experiments will provide us with plenty of additional useful information that will guide the project as we continue to move forward.\" Although solar cells have existed on Earth since the late 1800s and currently generate about 4 percent of the world's electricity (in addition to powering the International Space Station), everything about solar power generation and transmission needed to be rethought for use on a large scale in space. Solar panels are bulky and heavy, making them expensive to launch, and they need extensive wiring to transmit power. To overcome these challenges, the SSPP team has had to envision and create new technologies, architectures, materials, and structures for a system that is capable of the practical realization of space solar power, while being light enough to be cost-effective for bulk deployment in space, and strong enough to withstand the punishing space environment. \"DOLCE demonstrates a new architecture for solar-powered spacecraft and phased antenna arrays. It exploits the latest generation of ultrathin composite materials to achieve unprecedented packaging efficiency and flexibility. With the further advances that we have already started to work on, we anticipate applications to a variety of future space missions,\" Pellegrino says. \"The entire flexible MAPLE array, as well as its core wireless power transfer electronic chips and transmitting elements, have been designed from scratch. This wasn't made from items you can buy because they didn't even exist. This fundamental rethinking of the system from the ground up is essential to realize scalable solutions for SSPP,\" Hajimiri says. The entire set of three prototypes within the SSPD was envisioned, designed, built, and tested by a team of about 35 individuals. \"This was accomplished with a smaller team and significantly fewer resources than what would be available in an industrial, rather than academic, setting. The highly talented team of individuals on our team has made it possible to achieve this,\" says Hajimiri. Those individuals, however\u2014a collection of graduate students, postdocs, and research scientists\u2014now represent the cutting edge in the burgeoning space solar power field. \"We're creating the next generation of space engineers,\" says SSPP researcher Harry A. Atwater, Caltech's Otis Booth Leadership Chair of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science and the Howard Hughes Professor of Applied Physics and Materials Science, and director of the Liquid Sunlight Alliance, a research institute dedicated to using sunlight to make liquid products that could be used for industrial chemicals, fuels, and building materials or products. Success or failure from the three testbeds will be measured in a variety of ways. The most important test for DOLCE is that the structure completely deploys from its folded-up configuration into its open configuration. For ALBA, a successful test will provide an assessment of which photovoltaic cells operate with maximum efficiency and resiliency. MAPLE's goal is to demonstrate selective free-space power transmission to different specific targets on demand. \"Many times, we asked colleagues at JPL and in the Southern California space industry for advice about the design and test procedures that are used to develop successful missions. We tried to reduce the risk of failure, even though the development of entirely new technologies is inherently a risky process,\" says Pellegrino. SSPP aims to ultimately produce a global supply of affordable, renewable, clean energy.

You\u2019ve heard of earthquakes. You may have even heard of Marsquakes. But have you heard of earthquakes in space, or spacequakes? Earth experiences a sort of quake in its magnetic field. It\u2019s part of the complex space weather the planet endures on a daily basis (very different than atmospheric weather \u2014 more on that later). Let\u2019s explore what spacequakes are, why they happen and what effect they have on our planet. Before talking about the ones that occur in space, it\u2019s useful to understand what causes earthquakes in the first place. Earthquakes happen when the planet\u2019s tectonic plates, which are constantly moving and shifting, get stuck. Stress builds up between the plates, and when they are finally able to move again, a tremendous amount of energy known as an earthquake is released. The moon and Mars both have quakes on their surfaces, too, just like Earth, but they are distinct from one another. Earthquakes travel in a direct way through the planet while moonquakes are more scattered. Marsquakes fall in between these two. And that\u2019s not all \u2014 there are all kinds of quakes around our solar system. Starquakes occur in a specific type of dense neutron star, which is the remnant of a massive star\u2019s core after it\u2019s collapsed, called a magnetar. A magnetar is a neutron star with a magnetic field so strong that it actually warps the outer layer of the star, a hard crust that forms over a fluid core. When this warping occurs, it\u2019s called a starquake. Asteroids have quakes, too. Over the millions and billions of years that asteroids move through space, their surface turns a dark red color thanks to exposure to cosmic rays and radiation. But some don\u2019t, and scientists believe this is due to close flybys of planets that cause seismic events on asteroids. As they\u2019re twisted and rocked by the gravity of other planets, that red muck is cleaned off thanks to seismic asteroidquakes. Obviously, spacequakes are different than earthquakes and quakes of other planetary bodies because there aren\u2019t shifting tectonic plates to think about. But there are strong magnetic forces that make up spacequakes. These earthquakes in space are still considered temblors or tremors, but instead of being on land, they\u2019re located inside Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Earth\u2019s magnetosphere is one of the reasons life can exist on this planet. We have a strong magnetic field compared to our fellow inner rocky planets. This protects us from space radiation and our atmosphere from erosion, among other things. But despite its protective nature, our magnetosphere isn\u2019t a calm and tranquil place. Interaction between our magnetic field and solar wind is what creates space weather \u2014 and earthquakes in space. Earth\u2019s magnetic field is extended out like the tail of a comet thanks to solar wind. When it gets overstretched, it ends up snapping back like a rubber band. That\u2019s when spacequakes, which were first detected in 2010 by the THEMIS spacecraft, occur. Solar wind plasma (also called ionized gas) that\u2019s trapped in the magnetic tail is released and races toward Earth. It gets caught in Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field, but the impact sets off a chain of events in which the trapped plasma actually bounces off the magnetic field over and over again. When this happens, it creates \u201cspace twisters,\u201d or vortices, high above Earth\u2019s equator. They\u2019re visible from Earth through auroras, where they can create ripples. Spacequakes are so strong that their energy is equivalent to a magnitude 5 or 6 earthquake, and while they occur in space, the reverberations can reach Earth\u2019s surface. These strong magnetic events can also instigate spikes in electricity that can affect the power grid. While these earthquakes in space may have electromagnetic effects that can reach Earth\u2019s surface, they generally don\u2019t cause permanent damage of any kind. But researchers are still delving into the potential implications of these natural phenomena to understand their short- and long-term effects on the planet.

The emerging technologies of mixed reality (MR) and virtual reality (VR) are afroth with specialized terminology. Beyond MR and VR, this technology space includes terms like augmented reality, augmented virtuality, extended reality, spatial computing, wearable computing, ubiquitous computing and metaverse. By the time you read this, there may be more. Any \u201cdigital realities\u201d discussion obliges a commitment to define terms and contexts. The surfeit of terms can be laboriously exhausting to understand and erode the excitement and interest of the curious outside of innovators and early adopters. MR and VR are destined to merge into a single entity and are already slowly converging. We should reflect this when speaking about the technology space by being concise when referencing the general and intentional and when diving into nuances. Luckily, we already have a way of taming the jargon and do not need to expand the already unwieldy lexicon. Extended reality (XR) is the consensus term for \u201call real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions.\u201d Intelligent Security Summit On-Demand Learn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch on-demand sessions today. The reality-virtuality continuum describes a digital reality space with endpoints of reality and virtual reality. Mixed reality is the spectrum between the endpoints. From a contemporary perspective, there are clear boundaries between reality and MR, and reality and VR. The MR spectrum is naturally and unreconcilably fuzzy and without well-defined boundaries. Reality and VR are discrete states, but MR is a non-linear gradient.   Extended reality is the spectrum from MR up to and including VR, or from another perspective, it is the reality-virtuality continuum excluding reality.  We can call this subset of the reality-virtuality continuum the extended reality continuum. Technological advancements and improved experience design will reduce the significance of the differences between MR and VR, causing users (even sophisticated ones) to become unaware of the differences. Classifications, as defined by the XR continuum, will have meaning only for designers and developers.   It is interesting to imagine that the distinction between MR and VR may not always be as straightforward as it is today. We are seeing early instances of immersive digital experiences being fluid and not distinctly MR or VR. This duality raises questions about how being both MR and VR impacts the quality of user experience. For the sake of exploration, let us assume hardware and software exist to support both high-quality MR and VR experiences. The form factor is immaterial, but to aid the imagination, think of Geordi La Forge\u2019s visor (Star Trek: The Next Generation), any helmeted character in Star Wars (Darth Vader, the Mandalorian, stormtroopers), or an implanted device (contact lens or eye replacements) like in Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d (S1E3). Several questions immediately arise when considering the impact of multidimensional extended reality on experience design. What are the benefits and detriments of an experience having multiple postures in the XR continuum? Can a single experience successfully go back and forth between MR and VR? Can a single experience successfully cover multiple stops in the MR spectrum? How do we design MR experiences that are actual augmented reality? Where in the XR continuum is the best experience for my users and their problem space? Here are some of my early speculative thoughts. Designers should declare to be either MR or VR and stay true to that posture, but this thinking should be challenged and validated. Switching between MR and VR, if possible, will likely be through well-defined modalities, or shift so slowly that the user is unaware of any change. However, attempting to be both MR and VR within the same experience is probably a design trap. For now, it is impossible to do anything more than speculate and experiment. However, we can advance educated hypotheses using past wisdom from interactive experience design. Device hardware will take on this dichotomy too. The most recent wave of stand-out devices, like Oculus, HoloLens, Magic Leap and smartphones (iPhone and Android), have a strong disposition toward either MR or VR. Each device optimizes to enable one experience type or another, but not both, and for good reason. Supporting both creates many technical challenges and can dramatically affect production costs, in addition to the previously mentioned experience design challenges. However, this is changing, and future device iterations will support both MR and VR experiences. Devices like those from Varjo, Lynx and Meta are screen-based, with passthrough camera capabilities. Passthrough means the device uses an exterior camera to capture what the screen obscures, allowing the user to \u201csee through the screen.\u201d These devices can support MR and VR experiences with high resolution. The Magic Leap 2 (ML2) can dim the outer lens to create a not-quite-opaque view of reality. This feature is more about improving the visual quality of rendered content and less about a meaningful attempt to enable VR experiences. MR devices fall significantly short of supporting a quality VR experience due to a limited field of view and an inability to block out the physical environment completely. It is easy to imagine (and hope) for a generation of XR devices \u2014 any device capable of supporting any experience along the XR continuum \u2014 and not devices solely dedicated to MR or VR. Unfortunately, this may take several years and likely require different form factors than we have today. Still, there will continue to be a market for dedicated MR and VR devices. As the technologies become commoditized, low-cost or solution-optimized hardware will continue to singularly support either VR or MR. Embrace XR as the general anchor point for discussing MR and VR technologies, as it best fits the general expressions of MR and VR. The term supports discussions with a broad audience and within the creator community. There is a cognitive benefit in simplification for all. The extended reality continuum is a grounding structure for technical or detailed discourse that designers and developers require. Settling on a simpler lexicon lets us focus on much more interesting things. Simplifying and coalescing terminology helps us move beyond the \u201cCan we do this?\u201d phase of an emerging technology and into exploring what experiences the technology can enable. Designers and technologists need to prepare for the full spectrum of XR experiences. Now is the time to explore the XR continuum and establish the experience design principles which will define the future and success of the medium. We are beginning what I find to be the most exciting and exuberant phase of any emerging technology. Jarrett Webb is technology director at argodesign Welcome to the VentureBeat community!

Beyond MR and VR, this technology space includes terms like augmented reality, augmented virtuality, extended reality, spatial computing, wearable computing, ubiquitous computing and metaverse. By the time you read this, there may be more.\nAny \u201cdigital realities\u201d discussion obliges a commitment to define terms and contexts. The surfeit of terms can be laboriously exhausting to understand and erode the excitement and interest of the curious outside of innovators and early adopters.\nMR and VR are destined to merge into a single entity and are already slowly converging. We should reflect this when speaking about the technology space by being concise when referencing the general and intentional and when diving into nuances.\nLuckily, we already have a way of taming the jargon and do not need to expand the already unwieldy lexicon. Extended reality (XR) is the consensus term for \u201call real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\nIntelligent Security Summit On-Demand\nLearn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies.

Mixed reality is the spectrum between the endpoints. From a contemporary perspective, there are clear boundaries between reality and MR, and reality and VR. The MR spectrum is naturally and unreconcilably fuzzy and without well-defined boundaries. Reality and VR are discrete states, but MR is a non-linear gradient.  \nExtended reality is the spectrum from MR up to and including VR, or from another perspective, it is the reality-virtuality continuum excluding reality.  We can call this subset of the reality-virtuality continuum the extended reality continuum.\n\nTechnological advancements and improved experience design will reduce the significance of the differences between MR and VR, causing users (even sophisticated ones) to become unaware of the differences. Classifications, as defined by the XR continuum, will have meaning only for designers and developers.  \nThe impact on experience design\nIt is interesting to imagine that the distinction between MR and VR may not always be as straightforward as it is today. We are seeing early instances of immersive digital experiences being fluid and not distinctly MR or VR. This duality raises questions about how being both MR and VR impacts the quality of user experience.\nFor the sake of exploration, let us assume hardware and software exist to support both high-quality MR and VR experiences. The form factor is immaterial, but to aid the imagination, think of Geordi La Forge\u2019s visor (Star Trek: The Next Generation), any helmeted character in Star Wars (Darth Vader, the Mandalorian, stormtroopers), or an implanted device (contact lens or eye replacements) like in Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d (S1E3).\nSeveral questions immediately arise when considering the impact of multidimensional extended reality on experience design. What are the benefits and detriments of an experience having multiple postures in the XR continuum? Can a single experience successfully go back and forth between MR and VR? Can a single experience successfully cover multiple stops in the MR spectrum? How do we design MR experiences that are actual augmented reality? Where in the XR continuum is the best experience for my users and their problem space?\nHere are some of my early speculative thoughts. Designers should declare to be either MR or VR and stay true to that posture, but this thinking should be challenged and validated. Switching between MR and VR, if possible, will likely be through well-defined modalities, or shift so slowly that the user is unaware of any change. However, attempting to be both MR and VR within the same experience is probably a design trap.\nFor now, it is impossible to do anything more than speculate and experiment. However, we can advance educated hypotheses using past wisdom from interactive experience design.\nThe impact on hardware\nDevice hardware will take on this dichotomy too. The most recent wave of stand-out devices, like Oculus, HoloLens, Magic Leap and smartphones (iPhone and Android), have a strong disposition toward either MR or VR. Each device optimizes to enable one experience type or another, but not both, and for good reason. Supporting both creates many technical challenges and can dramatically affect production costs, in addition to the previously mentioned experience design challenges.\nHowever, this is changing, and future device iterations will support both MR and VR experiences. Devices like those from Varjo, Lynx and Meta are screen-based, with passthrough camera capabilities. Passthrough means the device uses an exterior camera to capture what the screen obscures, allowing the user to \u201csee through the screen.\u201d These devices can support MR and VR experiences with high resolution.\nThe Magic Leap 2 (ML2) can dim the outer lens to create a not-quite-opaque view of reality. This feature is more about improving the visual quality of rendered content and less about a meaningful attempt to enable VR experiences. MR devices fall significantly short of supporting a quality VR experience due to a limited field of view and an inability to block out the physical environment completely.\nIt is easy to imagine (and hope) for a generation of XR devices \u2014 any device capable of supporting any experience along the XR continuum \u2014 and not devices solely dedicated to MR or VR. Unfortunately, this may take several years and likely require different form factors than we have today. Still, there will continue to be a market for dedicated MR and VR devices. As the technologies become commoditized, low-cost or solution-optimized hardware will continue to singularly support either VR or MR.\nConverging points\nEmbrace XR as the general anchor point for discussing MR and VR technologies, as it best fits the general expressions of MR and VR. The term supports discussions with a broad audience and within the creator community. There is a cognitive benefit in simplification for all. The extended reality continuum is a grounding structure for technical or detailed discourse that designers and developers require. Settling on a simpler lexicon lets us focus on much more interesting things.\nSimplifying and coalescing terminology helps us move beyond the \u201cCan we do this?\u201d phase of an emerging technology and into exploring what experiences the technology can enable. Designers and technologists need to prepare for the full spectrum of XR experiences. Now is the time to explore the XR continuum and establish the experience design principles which will define the future and success of the medium.\nWe are beginning what I find to be the most exciting and exuberant phase of any emerging technology.\nJarrett Webb is technology director at argodesign\n\nDataDecisionMakers\nWelcome to the VentureBeat community!\nDataDecisionMakers is where experts, including the technical people doing data work, can share data-related insights and innovation.\nIf you want to read about cutting-edge ideas and up-to-date information, best practices, and the future of data and data tech, join us at DataDecisionMakers.\nYou might even consider contributing an article of your own!\nRead More From DataDecisionMakers\n \n\n", "", "", ""], "prompt": [], "summary": [], "blockWordCount": ["7681", "7647", "0", "0", "0"]}}}}
