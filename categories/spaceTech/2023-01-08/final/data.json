            "text": "New images from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal for the first time galaxies with stellar bars \u2014 elongated features of stars stretching from the centers of galaxies into their outer disks \u2014 at a time when the universe was a mere 25% of its present age. The finding of so-called barred galaxies, similar to our Milky Way, this early in the universe will require astrophysicists to refine their theories of galaxy evolution.\n\nPrior to JWST, images from the Hubble Space Telescope had never detected bars at such young epochs. In a Hubble image, one galaxy, EGS-23205, is little more than a disk-shaped smudge, but in the corresponding JWST image taken this past summer, it\u2019s a beautiful spiral galaxy with a clear stellar bar.\n\n\u201cI took one look at these data, and I said, \u2018We are dropping everything else!\u2019\u201d said Shardha Jogee, professor of astronomy at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThe bars hardly visible in Hubble data just popped out in the JWST image, showing the tremendous power of JWST to see the underlying structure in galaxies,\u201d she said, describing data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS), led by UT Austin professor, Steven Finkelstein.\n\nThe team identified another barred galaxy, EGS-24268, also from about 11 billion years ago, which makes two barred galaxies existing farther back in time than any previously discovered.\n\nIn an article accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, they highlight these two galaxies and show examples of four other barred galaxies from more than 8 billion years ago.\n\n\u201cFor this study, we are looking at a new regime where no one had used this kind of data or done this kind of quantitative analysis before,\u201d said Yuchen \u201cKay\u201d Guo, a graduate student who led the analysis, \u201cso everything is new. It\u2019s like going into a forest that nobody has ever gone into.\u201d\n\nBars play an important role in galaxy evolution by funneling gas into the central regions, boosting star formation.\n\n\u201cBars solve the supply chain problem in galaxies,\u201d Jogee said. \u201cJust like we need to bring raw material from the harbor to inland factories that make new products, a bar powerfully transports gas into the central region where the gas is rapidly converted into new stars at a rate typically 10 to 100 times faster than in the rest of the galaxy.\u201d\n\nBars also help to grow supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies by channeling the gas part of the way.\n\n\n\nThis simulation shows both how stellar bars form (left) and the bar-driven gas inflows (right). Stellar bars play an important role in galaxy evolution by funneling gas into the central regions of a galaxy, where it is rapidly converted into new stars, at a rate typically 10 to 100 times as fast as the rate in the rest of the galaxy. Bars also indirectly help to grow supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies by channeling the gas part of the way. Credit: Francoise Combes, Paris Observatory\n\nThe discovery of bars during such early epochs shakes up galaxy evolution scenarios in several ways.\n\n\u201cThis discovery of early bars means galaxy evolution models now have a new pathway via bars to accelerate the production of new stars at early epochs,\u201d Jogee said.\n\nAnd the very existence of these early bars challenges theoretical models as they need to get the galaxy physics right in order to predict the correct abundance of bars. The team will be testing different models in their next papers.\n\nJWST can unveil structures in distant galaxies better than Hubble for two reasons: First, its larger mirror gives it more light-gathering ability, allowing it to see farther and with higher resolution. Second, it can see through dust better as it observes at longer infrared wavelengths than Hubble.\n\nUndergraduate students Eden Wise and Zilei Chen played a key role in the research by visually reviewing hundreds of galaxies, searching for those that appeared to have bars, which helped narrow the list to a few dozen for the other researchers to analyze with a more intensive mathematical approach.\n\nReference: \u201cFirst Look at z > 1 Bars in the Rest-Frame Near-Infrared with JWST Early CEERS Imaging\u201d by Yuchen Guo, Shardha Jogee, Steven L.

            "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has been good for tech companies.\n\nThe global economy has moved online overnight. From groceries to medical consultations to art, the economy has become tech-driven.\n\nThe pandemic has thus enabled technology to become the engine of our daily lives faster than expected. One of the big changes also accompanied by tech during the pandemic is the transformation of the way we work.\n\nRemote work has established itself as the new organization of work. Regardless of the activity, working remotely has become the norm, which has forced the restaurant industry to develop home delivery, for example. This transformation of the economy into a tech-regulated economy has thus benefited Silicon Valley, which is home to a large number of tech companies.\n\nWhen the economy reopened, many habits born during the pandemic became anchored in everyday life and even within tech companies themselves. This is the case with remote work. Many employees no longer want to return to the office because the pandemic, they explain, has shown that working from home is just as effective. So why change, they seem to ask.\n\nWork From Home\n\nFearing the disappearance of the corporate culture, many firms have tried different formulas to bring back their employees, but it has not worked. Apple (AAPL) - Get Free Report, Google (GOOGL) - Get Free Report and Meta Platforms (META) - Get Free Report have had to postpone the return to the office several times.\n\nSome firms have ended up adopting a hybrid formula consisting of a minimum number of days in the office. But even this arrangement isn't enough to bring employees back to the office.\n\nBut what appeared to be a problem for companies is now finally proving to be a boon at a time when a recession is anticipated. Faced with the slowdown in growth, many tech companies have begun to drastically reduce their costs to protect their profits. Not only are they cutting thousands of jobs, but they are also closing offices.\n\nRecently Salesforce (CRM) - Get Free Report, whose tower is one of San Francisco's most visible symbols, unveiled, on January 4, a vast restructuring plan, including massive job cuts, downsizing of its office space and exits from some property markets.\n\nUnsurprisingly, San Francisco is one of the cities that suffers the most from the growing phenomenon of empty offices.\n\nA report from Savills found that the office availability rate in San Francisco set a new all-time high in the fourth quarter at 32.1%, up from 28.9% in the third quarter. This means that almost a third of the office space in the city is currently empty. Availability of sublease space increased to 8.2M square feet, up from 7.7M SF in the third quarter.\n\n\"Persistent uncertainty over the economy, the widespread adoption of the hybrid workplace, slow return to office utilization, and an ongoing correction in the technology sector has shown that lower office space demand might be the new normal going into 2023,\u201d the report said.\n\n\"As a result, expect highly tenant-favorable office market conditions to remain for the foreseeable future as record-high availability levels are forecasted to continue to increase even if local employers attempt to get their employees back into the office [this] year.\"\n\n'It Will Go Lower'\n\nElon Musk, the new owner of Twitter currently headquartered in San Francisco, thinks the situation will even get worse. It all started with a message from investor David Sacks saying he had a very attractive offer to rent offices in the city.\n\n\"Just got offered office space in San Francisco (SOMA) for the same price as 2009. Yikes,\" Sacks, who is also Musk's friend posted on January 8.\n\n\"It will go lower,\" Musk commented.\n\nMusk hasn't said if Twitter will leave San Francisco yet, but given this tweet and other remarks he's already made about the city, it won't be surprising to see the platform leave California in the coming months.\n\nIn adddition, Twitter's landlord -- Columbia Reit- 650 California LLC --, said in late December it notified the platform that the company will default on its rent. The New York Times reported on Dec. 13 that Twitter hadn't paid rent for several weeks for any of its global or San Francisco offices.\n\nMusk moved Tesla (TSLA) - Get Free Report to Texas from California in 2021.\n\nTech has helped make remote work a norm. Now tech cities are suffering.",

Even with that, Elon Musk expects even lower prices for offices. Companies such as Twitter are now defaulting on conventional rent payments and some firms have adopted a hybrid work model instead of returning to the office full time."

            "text": "2022 was a busy year for the United States National Aeronautic and Space Administration and 2023 promises more space progress. Today, we look forward to some of NASA\u2019s planned missions.\n\nLunar landings\n\nOne of NASA\u2019s major missions last year resulted in a successful uncrewed test flight that sent the Orion spacecraft into orbit around the moon. The mission is part of the space agency\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to land American astronauts on the moon by the mid-2020s.\n\nIn preparation of that goal, NASA has contracted with private companies to build landers for the moon. Their design permits them to carry equipment and instruments for studying conditions on the lunar surface.\n\nSeveral landers are expected to arrive on the moon this year. One, developed by NASA partner Intuitive Machines, is set to launch in early to mid-2023. The IM-1 mission will land at an area called Schroter\u2019s Valley on the near side of the moon.\n\nAnother, built by NASA partner Astrobotic, is to launch sometime before April. The space agency said that spacecraft, called the Peregrine Lunar Lander, is expected to land near Lacus Mortis, an area near the equator of the moon.\n\nThe landers\u2019 instruments will collect data on and examine many parts of the moon\u2019s atmosphere and surface. In addition, they will study things like how radio signals behave on the moon and will test landing technologies and communication systems.\n\nESA Jupiter mission\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) plans to launch a spacecraft to explore Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is a giant gas planet, with an atmosphere made up mostly of hydrogen and helium.\n\nESA officials have said they plan to launch the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft, called JUICE, sometime in April. The mission will make detailed observations of Jupiter as well as its three large moons, Ganymede, Callisto and Europa.\n\nESA says it hopes the in-depth observations will help scientists learn more about Jupiter\u2019s complex environment as they use the planet as a model for other gas giants across the universe.\n\nAsteroid missions\n\nNASA plans to launch its Psyche spacecraft in early October. It is expected to travel three-and-a-half years to an asteroid. The metal asteroid is orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter. NASA wants to study it. Scientists believe it may have separated in violent crashes during the creation of the solar system.\n\nThe other will be a return mission of NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft. It spent more than two years observing an asteroid named Bennu. In October 2020, the spacecraft successfully collected sample material from the asteroid.\n\nOSIRIS-Rex is now on a trip back to Earth, with an expected arrival in September of 2023. Scientists say they hope the sample can help them better understand how planets formed, as well as how life might have developed on Earth.\n\nBoeing Starliner test flight\n\nBoeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft is set to attempt its first crewed test mission to the International Space Station (ISS) in April. The test is the last step in the process before NASA approves the spacecraft to carry out regular missions to the ISS. Private American company SpaceX, another NASA partner, has been transporting astronauts and materials to the ISS since 2020.\n\nStarliner completed its first uncrewed flight test to the ISS in May. But Boeing experienced several technical difficulties with the spacecraft during the mission and has worked with NASA to fix the problems as it prepares for the planned crewed flight.\n\nExperimental aircraft\n\nNASA also plans to fly two experimental aircraft in 2023.\n\nThe first mission is called Quesst. It involves a NASA research plane called X-59, a supersonic aircraft. Supersonic is a term for an object that travels faster than the speed of sound.\n\nThe goal of Quesst is to provide data that could change rules that ban supersonic flight over land. NASA says X-59 was developed with technology that reduces the loudness of a sonic boom to very low levels heard on the ground.\n\nNASA\u2019s other experimental plane with plans to fly in 2023 is called X-57. The aircraft runs on electric power. It was built to demonstrate that all-electric technology could make flying cleaner, quieter and more sustainable.\n\nI\u2019m Bryan Lynn.\n\nBryan Lynn wrote this story for VOA Learning English, based on reports from NASA, The Associated Press and Reuters.\n\nQuiz - Space Missions to Watch in 2023 Start the Quiz to find out Start Quiz\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWords in This Story\n\nmission \u2013 n. an important project or trip, especially involving space travel\n\ngiant \u2013 adj. very large\n\nsample \u2013 n. a small amount of something that gives you information about the thing it was taken from\n\nsonic boom \u2013 n. an explosive sound made by an aircraft, bullet, etc. made when something travels faster than the speed of sound\n\nsustainable \u2013 adj. able to continue over time\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nWhat do you think of this story?

Founded by NASA-affiliated entrepreneur and engineer Anja Contractor, the idea stemmed from giving astronauts exact, individualized, 3D-printed meals in microgravity. Here, crew time is restricted, and cooking is not an option.\n\n\"What you see over here is a shipping container...we have completely changed that,\" Contractor said. \"On one side, plastic waste is collected, which will be shredded. It will eventually move into the bioreactor, which contains very specific engineered bacteria.\"\n\nIE learned that the engineered bacteria eat the plastic and convert it into biomass. This biomass can then be used to produce a variety of textures and shapes.\n\n\"So if you want to create steak out of plastic, the entire mechanism on one side of this container will be able to produce steak out of plastic- or chicken breasts,\" he explained.\n\nTackling food insecurity on Earth\n\nAs you can imagine, printing 3D meals could help tackle food issues right here on Earth.\n\nContractor revealed that the project is funded by The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)- one of the biggest government-backed forces behind innovation in the US.\n\n\"The idea is to first put this type of container at food disaster relief operations such as those related to FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), or locations where there are refugee camps.,\" he said.",

            "text": "According to recent research from the University of Bath in the UK, newborn supramassive stars, rather than black holes, may be the cause of gamma-ray bursts.\n\nSatellites orbiting Earth have detected Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as luminous flashes of extremely energetic gamma-ray radiation that last from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. These catastrophic blasts occur in distant galaxies billions of light-years away from Earth.\n\nA type of GRB called a short-duration GRB is produced when two neutron stars collide. These ultra-dense stars, which have the mass of our Sun compressed into a size smaller than a city, generate ripples in space-time called gravitational waves just before triggering a GRB in their final moments.\n\nUntil now, space scientists have largely agreed that the \u2018engine\u2019 powering such energetic and short-lived bursts must always come from a newly formed black hole (a region of space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it). However, new research by an international team of astrophysicists, led by Dr. Nuria Jordana-Mitjans at the University of Bath in the UK, is challenging this scientific orthodoxy.\n\nAccording to the study\u2019s findings, some short-duration GRBs are triggered by the birth of a supramassive star (otherwise known as a neutron star remnant) not a black hole.\n\nDr. Jordana-Mitjans said: \u201cSuch findings are important as they confirm that newborn neutron stars can power some short-duration GRBs and the bright emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum that have been detected accompanying them. This discovery may offer a new way to locate neutron star mergers, and thus gravitational waves emitters when we\u2019re searching the skies for signals.\u201d\n\nCompeting theories\n\nMuch is known about short-duration GRBs. They start life when two neutron stars, which have been spiraling ever closer, constantly accelerating, finally crash. And from the crash site, a jetted explosion releases the gamma-ray radiation that makes a GRB, followed by a longer-lived afterglow. A day later, the radioactive material that was expelled in all directions during the explosion produced what researchers call a kilonova.\n\nHowever, precisely what remains after two neutron stars collide \u2013 the \u2018product\u2019 of the crash \u2013 and consequently the power source that gives a GRB its extraordinary energy, has long been a matter of debate. Scientists may now be closer to resolving this debate, thanks to the findings of the Bath-led study.\n\nSpace scientists are split between two theories. The first theory has it that neutron stars merge to briefly form an extremely massive neutron star, only for this star to then collapse into a black hole in a fraction of a second. The second argues that the two neutron stars would result in a less heavy neutron star with a higher life expectancy.\n\nSo the question that has been needling astrophysicists for decades is this: are short-duration GRBs powered by a black hole or by the birth of a long-lived neutron star?\n\nTo date, most astrophysicists have supported the black hole theory, agreeing that to produce a GRB, it is necessary for the massive neutron star to collapse almost instantly.\n\nElectromagnetic signals\n\nAstrophysicists learn about neutron star collisions by measuring the electromagnetic signals of the resultant GRBs. The signal originating from a black hole would be expected to differ from that coming from a neutron star remnant.\n\nThe electromagnetic signal from the GRB explored for this study (named GRB 180618A) made it clear to Dr. Jordana-Mitjans and her collaborators that a neutron star remnant rather than a black hole must have given rise to this burst.\n\nElaborating, Dr. Jordana-Mitjans said: \u201cFor the first time, our observations highlight multiple signals from a surviving neutron star that lived for at least one day after the death of the original neutron star binary.\u201d\n\nProfessor Carole Mundell, study co-author and professor of Extragalactic Astronomy at Bath, where she holds the Hiroko Sherwin Chair in Extragalactic Astronomy, said: \u201cWe were excited to catch the very early optical light from this short gamma-ray burst \u2013 something that is still largely impossible to do without using a robotic telescope. But when we analyzed our exquisite data, we were surprised to find we couldn\u2019t explain it with the standard fast-collapse black hole model of GRBs.\n\n\u201cOur discovery opens new hope for upcoming sky surveys with telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory LSST with which we may find signals from hundreds of thousands of such long-lived neutron stars before they collapse to become black holes.\u201d\n\nDisappearing afterglow\n\nWhat initially puzzled the researchers was that the optical light from the afterglow that followed GRB 180618A disappeared after just 35 minutes. Further analysis showed that the material responsible for such a brief emission was expanding close to the speed of light due to some source of continuous energy that was pushing it from behind.\n\nWhat was more surprising was that this emission had the imprint of a newborn, rapidly spinning and highly magnetized neutron star called a millisecond magnetar. The team found that the magnetar after GRB 180618A was reheating the leftover material of the crash as it was slowing down.\n\nIn GRB 180618A, the magnetar-powered optical emission was one-thousand times brighter than what was expected from a classical kilonova.\n\nReference: \u201cA Short Gamma-Ray Burst from a Protomagnetar Remnant\u201d by N.

When complete near the end of the decade, the space lab will be about one sixth of the size of the International Space Station (ISS), featuring two habitation modules that will force crew members to all but forgo personal space.\n\n\"The International Habitation module will have habitable space of about 8 cubic meters [280 cubic feet] and you will have to share it with three others,\" Ren\u00e9 Waclavicek, a space architect and design researcher at Austria-based LIQUIFER Space Systems, said at the Czech Space Week conference in Brno (opens in new tab), the Czech Republic, on Nov. 30, 2022. \"In other words, that would be a room 2 by 2 by 2 meters [6.6 by 6.6 by 6.6 feet]. And you are locked in there. There are other rooms but they are not bigger and there are not many of them.\"\n\nRelated: Watch NASA's next-generation lunar Gateway space station build up in concept video\n\nWaclavicek was involved in the design phase of the Europe-built International Habitation module (opens in new tab), or I-Hab, which is one of Gateway's two habitable elements, essentially bed rooms combined with lab space (the other being the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (opens in new tab), HALO, developed by Northrop Grumman in the U.S.).\n\nWhen working on the design, the architects had to bow down to practical demands dictated by the nature of the project, Waclavicek said. Their initial hopes for larger modules, offering a more generous volume of habitable space akin to that available at the International Space Station, had to be abandoned due to the impossibility of launching massive components to the moon .\n\n\"We started off in the first phase with a cylinder with outer dimensions similar to what we know from the ISS,\" Waclavicek said. \"That's about 4.5 m [15 feet] in diameter and 6 m [20 feet] long. But due to mass restrictions, we had to shrink it down to 3 m [10 feet] in outer dimensions. And that left us with an interior cross section of only 1.2 m by 1.2 m [4 feet by 4 feet]. Most of the internal volume is consumed by machinery, so it's essentially just a corridor, where you have to turn 90 degrees if you want to stretch out.\"\n\nThe International Space Station, with its 7.2 by 7.2 feet-wide (2.2 by 2.2 m) interiors, where astronauts could even perform space gymnastics routines , offers a luxury experience compared to what awaits moon explorers on Gateway.\n\n\"[The I-Hab] really is just a cylinder with a hatch on each end and two hatches at the sides and a corridor going through the length axis,\" Waclavicek said. \"Even if you want to pass one another, it's already quite difficult, you have to interrupt whatever you are doing in the moment to let the other fellow pass by you.\"\n\nThe crew quarters of the NASA-led lunar Gateway station will be so small that astronauts will not be able to stand upright. (Image credit: ESA/NASA/ATG Medialab)\n\nSomehow, the architects managed to incorporate about 53 cubic feet (1.5 cubic m) of private space protected by closing doors for each crew member living inside the i-Hab. But the experience of staying aboard the Gateway will be challenging for more reasons than the cramped living quarters alone. As Waclavicek said, most of the module will be occupied by noisy and vibrating life-support technology, the constant hum of which will likely badly grate on the nerves of most mere mortals.\n\n\"Actually, you are living in a machine room,\" Waclavicek said. \"The life-support systems make noise, they have a lot of fans, and you have only 1.5 cubic m of private space where you can close the door and tame the noise.\"\n\nThe architects explored ways to ease the pressure on the crew and make the experience of staying aboard the Gateway more enjoyable, but they kept hitting technical limits, including those of launch vehicles available to send the module to its destination.\n\n\"We always get asked \"where is the window?\" Waclavicek said. \"At the International Space Station, the most popular place where astronauts spend every free minute is the window. But there are technical problems associated with it. The moon is a thousand times farther away [than the ISS] and each window is a disturbance in the continuity of the structure. Also, glass is very heavy so a window is the first thing that gets canceled.\"\n\nThere will, however, be smaller windows on the Gateway, located in the refueling module ESPRIT, which will also be built in Europe.\n\nWhile the American HALO module may be launched as early as 2024, I-Hab's journey to the moon is not expected before 2027. Currently, Waclawicek said, the team is working on the Critical Design Review, an important milestone before hardware manufacturing can commence, and has started building a real-size mockup for testing human interaction with the habitat environment.",

The space program had previously fallen under the purview of the air force, as the air and space arm. Some Israeli analysts have commented that the new branch offers more headline fodder than substance. But military planners have also noted that despite its role, the air force had not made space a significant focus of operations or procurements, and the new taskforce seems to be a restructuring to ensure space is no longer neglected.\n\nBut now the military says that space will be a near future combat arena\u2014but against who, and with what capabilities?\n\nIsrael has been a space power for more than 30 years\u2014launching its first satellite in 1988, and many more since. Since then it has shown offensive space capabilities, in 2015 demonstrating the Arrow 3 missile's ability to intercept a target in space\u2014a capability that could easily double as an anti-satellite weapon like those shown off by the United States, Russia and China. These capabilities alone though were not enough to justify creating a new space command structure.\n\nBut in the past, Israel's adversaries did not pose a threat in space or to Israel's satellite and orbital communications infrastructure. The new space administration has its eyes focused on Iran, and Tehran has been advancing its space program by leaps and bounds, despite a string of recent catastrophic failures. Tehran has successfully launched their own satellites on modified ballistic missiles, and that advanced missile program poses an existential threat to Israel\u2014one that requires space capable interceptors such as the Arrow 3 to counter.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just a question of regional threats anymore\u2014the United States, China and Russia all have their own space force variations, and Russia has entered a strategic partnership with Iran over the war in Syria. This will allow Iran access to more advanced space technologies but also will force Israel to look for ways to counter Russian made space threats that could be provided by Moscow.\n\nIsrael's future will be one with for more spaceborne threats than the nation faced in the past\u2014meaning space technologies can no longer be neglected by the air force or consigned to the MAPAT research and development wing of the Defense Ministry. Instead a detailed space defense policy needs to be inked\u2014and that means a new command structure willing to invest in it.",

            "text": "Reddit Vote Share 0 Shares\n\nState-space models (SSMs) are models created to represent dynamic systems using state variables. These models primarily work with time-series data and use a collection of first-order differential equations to describe a system. With recent technological advancements, SSMs have achieved remarkable performance in domains like financial research and time series forecasting. However, one area where they fall short of expectations involves language modeling tasks, as they cannot match the performance of transformer systems. SSMs are also slower than Transformers, despite even scaling approximately linearly rather than quadratically for sequence length. Researchers believe that the primary cause behind this is hardware underutilization.\n\nResearchers from Stanford University collaborated with the State University of New York at Buffalo in an effort to comprehend and close this gap between SSMs and transformer language model attention mechanisms. The team documented the results of their investigation in the recent paper, \u2018Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling using State Space Models.\u2019 They also studied various methods to lower the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention and came up with a novel state-passing algorithm called FlashConv, which achieves 2x speedups on the Long Range Arena benchmark and enables 1.6x faster text generation than conventional transformer architectures.\n\nThe two key features existing SSMs struggle with are remembering previously encountered tokens and comparing tokens between sequences. The team used synthetic language modeling tasks focused on text manipulation to identify these expressivity gaps between SSMs and attention. The team contributed significantly to creating a new SSM layer termed Hungry Hungry Hippo (H3) as an alternative to attention in language modeling. The proposed H3 layer stacks two discrete SSMs with multiplicative interactions between input projections and the corresponding outputs to simulate comparisons between different points in a sequence. H3 compares favorably to Transformers on OpenWebText in terms of perplexity and matches attention on synthetic languages. Additionally, on the OpenWebText benchmark, a hybrid H3-attention model outperforms transformers by 1.0 PPL (perplexity).\n\nThe researchers also suggested FlashConv, a hierarchical approach, as a superior hardware-aware technique for SSMs. The algorithm was designed to enable SSMs to utilize contemporary accelerators and function more quickly than attention. FlashConv uses the FFT (fast Fourier transform) algorithm to enhance efficiency on text sequences. Inputs can be divided into smaller pieces to fit into GPU SRAM for effective computation by taking advantage of the recurring qualities of SSMs to process the input in chunks. As a result, FlashConv can scale SSMs on GPU SRAM to any sequence length with nearly linear computational complexity.\n\nAfter several experimental evaluations, the team concluded that FlashConv set a new state-of-the-art speed record on the long range arena benchmark by yielding a 2x speedup. Additionally, the team scaled hybrid H3-attention language models with up to 1.3B parameters using FlashConv. These models excelled on most SuperGLUE benchmark tasks using zero- and few-shot learning. The scaling of SSMs to larger sizes is a potential approach, the researchers concluded as a result. The researchers are eager to continue combining the complementing qualities of SSMs and attention in their future work. This was primarily due to their performance gains over the pure H3 model and Transformers by simply combining two attention layers to H3. The researchers are eager to investigate more sophisticated designs for combining SSMs.\n\nCheck out the Paper. All Credit For This Research Goes To the Researchers on This Project.
