Vice-chairman, Neuberg Diagnostics                         Over the years, the Indian diagnostics sector has witnessed exponential growth. The traditional medical practice has given way to evidence-based medical practice and nowadays to a great extent the clinicians depend on diagnostics segment to validate, accurately diagnose illnesses, so as to provide the necessary treatment protocols, as well as the shift in consumer psyche and preference. Clearly diagnostics medicine has emerged as a key component of overall healthcare management programme. The domestic diagnostic market is estimated to be about $10 billion, and over the following five years, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of almost 12% to 13%. No wonder therefore, the diagnostic sector has emerged as the key service sector with the highest growth in India. The main growth drivers for the sector include an increase in healthcare spending and life expectancy, rising income levels, greater awareness of preventative testing, improved diagnostic tests, an increase in diseases connected to lifestyle, and government healthcare initiatives. Impact of the pandemic on the diagnostic sector The COVID-19 pandemic in the last two years shook the medical diagnostics sector like never before. The need for diagnostics such as RT-PCR and Antigen tests increased dramatically overnight. The great demand for COVID-19 tests and treatments forced diagnostics manufacturers to refocus their operations with greater emphasis on home collection, although many struggled to gather the funding and personnel to do so. There have been a few trends that have been shaping up the diagnostics space in India: Genetic testing
This is one of the most advanced and in-demand diagnostic trends. There are many types of genetic testing based on the required outcome and the individual being tested. Predictive genetic testing: This type of testing aids in determining the likelihood that a person may contract a disease, whether they have a family history or not. Predictive testing is available for health issues like cancer, cardiovascular disease, and several single-gene illnesses. Diagnostic genetic testing: Diagnostic genetic testing is used to determine or confirm the diagnosis of a genetic disorder. Testing of this nature can occur at any point in a person’s life, including before birth. The test outcome may influence the treatment choice and how a disease develops. Chromosome analyses, direct DNA analyses, and biochemical and genetic testing are among the several such tests
Genomic testing: A genomic test takes a more thorough look at your genome, which is your complete collection of genetic “code” or instructions. A technique your doctor may employ to forecast how your cancer will progress and which medications may be most effective against it is ” Genomic testing.” It isalso referred to as “DNA sequencing.” Instead of focusing on one gene, the test examines all of your genes. Metabolomics: A new technology called metabolomics, which is the thorough examination of metabolites in a biological specimen, has the potential to guide the practice of precision medicine. The characterization of the metabolic phenotypes that underline the disease, the identification of novel therapeutic targets, and the identification of biomarkers that may be used to either diagnose a disease or track the effectiveness of therapeutics are all made possible by metabolomics, which provides detailed descriptions of these phenotypes. Proteomics: Technologies based on proteomics are used in a variety of ways for various research settings, including the identification of different diagnostic markers, the development of vaccine candidates, the comprehension of pathogenicity mechanisms, the alteration of expression patterns in response to various signals, and the interpretation of functional protein pathways in multiple diseases. Because proteomics involves classifying and analyzing a genome’s entire protein fingerprints. Real-time diagnostics
One of the most innovative methods in diagnostics, from wearable devices that can be used to track glucose to real-time PCR testing, real-time diagnostics have been truly path-breaking. Wearable biosensors can gather a wide range of physical health data, including heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, respiration rate, and body mobility. These devices can be integrated into watches, garments, bandages, glasses, contact lenses, and rings. Real-time diagnostics offer a significantly larger and more reliable data set for clinical decision-making than more conventional diagnostic procedures that record a “snapshot” picture of a patient for a specific parameter. They make it possible to monitor someone continuously, give prompt input on any deviations that may be noticed, and can be used to monitor someone’s general health and well-being. Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary technology that analyses complex data using computerized algorithms. Diagnostic imaging is one of the most potential clinical applications of AI, and increasing focus is being paid to establishing and optimizing its performance to make it easier to detect and quantify a variety of clinical disorders. Studies utilizing computer-aided diagnostics have demonstrated great specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy for detecting minor radiographic abnormalities, potentially enhancing public health. POCT
Faster than traditional lab-based testing, point-of-care testing (POCT) enables doctors to identify diseases at or close to the patient site. Microfluidics integration in POCT enables fluid manipulation and detection in a single device with less sample demand. The COVID-19 pandemic’s challenging circumstances have greatly increased the significance of POCT. In addition to glucose monitoring, pregnancy and infertility testing, infectious disease testing, cholesterol testing, and heart indicators, there are many point-of-care tests and diagnostic tools in the market and the numbers are only growing . Continuous development in the healthcare sector, especially diagnostics, helps in early detection and intervention and guides healthcare professionals on the best possible therapy method for that particular individual. From trivial pathologies to malignancies, the advancements in diagnostics have come a long way; this advancement not only helps in the treatment but also improves the quality and longevity of life.
