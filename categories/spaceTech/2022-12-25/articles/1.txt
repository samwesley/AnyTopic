Recreated 'Blue Marble' photo of Earth tests powerful new climate model | Space

The Blue Marble is arguably one of the most famous photographs of all time, so it makes perfect sense to use this beloved image as a test for a powerful new climate modeling program on one of the world's most powerful computers.  Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Germany set out to recreate the iconic image using nothing but the climate simulation and weather data from 1972. They didn't just want to recreate the view of swirling white clouds stretching across and around Earth, but also to bring that day in 1972 (or at least its weather patterns) to life. "Unlike the superficial beauty of the sun's light reflected by our Earth into the astronaut's camera lens, our Blue Marble is connected together by the laws of physics, which brings it into life and into motion," MPI-M officials wrote in a statement (opens in new tab).
