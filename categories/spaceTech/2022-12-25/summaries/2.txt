• Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari revealed that when he first proposed the idea of developing a hydrogen powered car in India, the members of the Parliament were scared as they thought it would blow up. 
• He made this statement during an event at All India Institute of Local Self Government (AIILSG) in Nagpur.
• According to him, these concerns regarding safety and feasibility have now been resolved and the project has gathered momentum due to its low-cost feature. 
• He further stated that once developed successfully, this hydrogen car could cost around Rs 5 lakh which is almost half the price compared to other vehicles running on electric or compressed natural gas (CNG). 
• Further work on building infrastructure for production and supply of hydrogen fuel from neighbouring countries is also being discussed with various stakeholders including France, Saudi Arabia and Iran.
