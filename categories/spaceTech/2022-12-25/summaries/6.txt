block 1: And the first results amazed astronomers.
"I downloaded the data, and I'm like, sitting in my pajamas...you know, it's pandemic, we're all working from home," Rigby said."I pulled down those data, and just started paging through them, pouring through them.And it was so beautiful." The telescope is only five months into its science mission, and it's already transforming astronomy.The telescope's instruments have allowed it to capture previously unobservable planets, stars and galaxies near and far. NPR spoke with three astronomers in different disciplines of astronomy about how JWST is advancing research in their area of expertise.They all agree JWST is a game changer, and that there's plenty more groundbreaking research still to come. 
Key Information: 
• One year ago on Christmas day the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) began its journey through space 
• After an initial calibration period the telescope started collecting data - stunning astronomers with its first images 
• An unparalleled tool for observing planets within our own solar system as well as distant galaxies  
• Coming up next year will be even more exciting discoveries from JWST
block 2:  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already begun to drastically change astronomy, with its observations of planets, stars and galaxies near and far. Three astronomers have discussed the impact JWST is having in their area of expertise, with particular attention being paid to the instrument's ability to detect Neptune's rings with unprecedented clarity. It has also helped researchers discover some of the oldest galaxies ever observed. Further images taken by JWST are helping us better understand our solar system and the evolution of stars.

Key Information: 
- The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is transforming astronomy 
- Able to capture previously unobservable planets, stars and galaxies 
- First results amazed astronomers 
- Clearest view of Neptune’s rings in decades  
- Allowing for identification of oldest known galaxies up to 13.4 billion years old 			
- Helping astronomers study distant icy giants like Neptune too  		   	        	     - Studying material composition through spectroscopy & cutting through cosmic dust    - Combining power from both Hubble & JWST for further research 
- Enough propellant onboard for more than 20 years
