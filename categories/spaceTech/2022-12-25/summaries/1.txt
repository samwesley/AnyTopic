Daily Briefing: 
-Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Germany set out to recreate an iconic Blue Marble photo using a powerful new climate modeling program and 1972 weather data.  
-The simulation not only produced the photo, but also recreated the day's climate patterns.  
-It incorporated hundreds of interacting climate variables, with precise detail down to clouds over Africa. 
-The MPI-M produced a video of the model bringing the image to life and beyond, incorporating ocean eddies below water surface too.
