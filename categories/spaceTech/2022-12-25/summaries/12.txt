Daily Briefing: 
- Startup Make Sunsets has reportedly launched weather balloons carrying reflective sulfur particles into the stratosphere in an effort to geoengineer Earth’s climate.
- Geoengineering is seen as a potential way to cool global warming and mimics a natural process that occurs after large volcanic eruptions.
- However, such efforts come with controversial implications and have mostly been refrained from receiving increased attention in scientific circles due to various dangers associated with it. 
- Company has allegedly attempted to sell “cooling credits” for future balloon flights carrying larger payloads, but this development is not viewed favorably by investors or researchers within the field of geoengineering.  
- Critics say attempts like these can set back research efforts in the field and necessitate greater oversight measures on whether experiments should continue or expand depending on what kind of social license exists amongst other nations globally.
