            "text": "If you ever have flexible dates for your travels, you might be wondering if it would be cheaper for you to book during the week rather than on a weekend.\n\nWe were very curious about this question as well so we analyzed nearly 3,000 data points to see what type of results we would find!\n\nBelow, I will break down the findings and tell you what you need to know about booking hotels during the week vs on the weekend.\n\nAre hotels cheaper during the week?\n\nAfter reviewing 2,800 data points for major US hotel chains, we found that the cheapest day of the week to stay at a hotel was Sunday, while Saturday was the most expensive.\n\nTo give you a sense of how much you could save, we ranked just how much cheaper every day of the week was compared to Saturday below:\n\nSaturday: most expensive\n\nFriday (3% cheaper)\n\nTuesday (3% cheaper)\n\nWednesday (4% cheaper)\n\nThursday (7% cheaper)\n\nMonday (8% cheaper)\n\nSunday (15% cheaper)\n\nThere are a few key takeaways for these findings.\n\nDifferent chains\n\nSaturday was the most expensive day for Hilton, Hyatt, and IHG. Interestingly, Tuesday was the most expensive day for Marriott.\n\nSunday was the cheapest day for all of the chains except for Hilton which had its cheapest day on Monday (Sunday was just barely more expensive than Monday for Hilton).\n\nSingle day stays\n\nIf you were just planning on staying a single day during the week, you may want to watch out for Tuesdays since it compares to the prices found on Friday which can be pretty high.\n\nMulti-day stays\n\nIf you were chasing the lowest rates then an ideal five night itinerary could be beginning your stay on Sunday and checking out on Friday morning.\n\nI\u2019ll show you an example so you can see how much you could save.\n\nLet\u2019s say that a Saturday night rate at a luxury hotel was $600 and that the prices for the other days of the week followed the same pattern as the data above.\n\nIf you checked in on a Sunday and checked out on Friday you would spend $2,244.94.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that you checked in on a Friday and then checked out on Wednesday, you would spend $2,779.08.\n\nSo by starting your trip on Sunday, you would save $534.14. Not bad.\n\nOf course, not every hotel follows this pattern and we dive deeper into the price trends below.\n\nRates almost always change throughout the week\n\nMost of the time, a hotel will have different rates for different days of any given week.\n\nIn fact, of the 2,800 data points we looked at, only about 7% of the hotels did not change price throughout the week. (Interestingly, most of the hotels that did not change price belonged to the IHG chain.)\n\nOn average, a given week had about five days with different prices. So for example Monday and Tuesday could be the same but every other day of the week would have a unique price.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t come as a big surprise as many hotels use sophisticated software to set the prices and we have even seen prices fluctuate by the hour.\n\nThe average price fluctuation that we saw between the cheapest and most expensive days of the week was $83.\n\nSo for the most part, the fluctuations during the week and on the weekends were not that bad.\n\nHowever, they are still worth paying attention to for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, about a quarter of the fluctuations were over $110, which can definitely add up.\n\nAlso, some hotels had pretty huge fluctuations during the week like The Adolphus, Autograph Collection which jumped up over $600 for a Friday and Saturday.\n\nTypically, you would think that the big fluctuations would happen on the weekends when the prices tend to go up in general.\n\nBut that was not always the case.\n\nFor example, the The Blackstone, Autograph Collection made a pretty big jump on Monday and Tuesday of almost $400 per night.\n\nUsually, these fluctuations would be caused by some kind of local event taking place, although it was not always easy to verify that.\n\nThese wild fluctuations are why it\u2019s always good to search with all of your actual travel dates and to compare your proposed travel dates to other dates.\n\nWhen going for searching efficiency, it can be tempting to simply choose a single date that falls within your travel date range and base your hotel expenses on that.\n\nBut that can often backfire if you are not accounting for the fluctuating prices throughout the week. You never know if one or two days have huge spikes.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t just search for your travel dates because then you won\u2019t know if other dates don\u2019t have the same fluctuations. I\u2019ve saved myself hundreds of dollars on trips just by swapping out one day for another.\n\nTry to use the calendar view on the hotel\u2019s website if you can.\n\nLeisure travel versus business travel\n\nI\u2019ve always been told that hotels that cater to business travelers will be more expensive during the week and those that cater towards leisure travelers will be more expensive during the weekend.\n\nIt certainly makes sense as that is the time when each of those respective groups tend to travel.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always so simple.\n\nFor one, lots of properties cater to both crowds and it can be difficult to designate a property as primarily business or primarily leisure. Unless you\u2019re very familiar with a specific brand or property, making this determination may not be practical.\n\nSo personally, I would just focus on searching for properties that you are interested in and not necessarily chasing business or leisure hotels based on their perceived categories.\n\nThen there is the king bed vs two queen beds comparison.\n\nTypically, a business traveler would probably prefer a king bed while a family traveling would prefer two queen beds.\n\nTherefore, you would think that two queen beds could be more expensive than a king bed at leisure property on the weekend. Also, two queen beds could be cheaper during the week at a hotel for business travelers.\n\nDuring our research, we did not classify rooms as queen or king so we did not test this out but it might be worth looking into. I know that many times I have seen the prices as the same for both king and queen bedrooms so at some hotels the pricing may not be affected.\n\nFinal recommendations\n\nSo after considering all of the data, here would be my recommendations.\n\nOverall, you can usually expect Saturday to be the most expensive day of the week and for Sunday or Monday to be the cheapest.\n\nIf you\u2019re staying during the week then you can expect Thursday to be your best bet at getting a cheaper rate and watch out for Tuesdays because those can be pretty expensive.\n\nBut just remember prices can dramatically jump up on any day of the week.\n\nWhile these trends will probably hold out to be true in most cases, when it comes to an individual booking, you just need to check your actual travel dates and compare those to others to see if you are getting hit with a big fluctuation.\n\nData\n\nBelow you can find all of the data that we used in the study. The room rates are the cheapest available room rates we found which were almost always a basic king or queen room.\n\nWe selected hotels from the four major chains: Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, and IHG. Also, we made sure to include a variety of different brands within those chains so that we included a large variety of room rate prices.\n\nProperty Name Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central $365 $361 $364 $333 $382 $361 $412 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New York Times Square West $245 $258 $258 $247 $244 $299 $199 Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collection by Hilton $272 $275 $265 $249 $249 $319 $254 DoubleTree by Hilton New York Midtown Fifth Ave $319 $355 $355 $357 $355 $391 $261 Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square South $273 $305 $305 $265 $281 $297 $190 Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square $300 $300 $298 $286 $323 $334 $256 DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown $243 $280 $280 $232 $307 $275 $181 Canopy by Hilton Jersey City Arts District $224 $224 $224 $207 $240 $304 $233 Home2 Suites by Hilton New York Long Island City/ Manhattan View, NY $283 $347 $341 $342 $359 $359 $358 Hilton New York Times Square $274 $374 $374 $274 $357 $357 $265 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles Downtown $188 $188 $188 $188 $206 $224 $188 Hilton Checkers Los Angeles $293 $268 $267 $274 $227 $233 $293 Hampton Inn & Suites Los Angeles/Hollywood $231 $238 $252 $269 $288 $288 $266 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles \u2013 Commerce $140 $160 $155 $140 $163 $235 $140 Hampton Inn and Suites Los Angeles \u2013 Glendale $199 $199 $199 $199 $210 $235 $199 Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles Glendale $214 $214 $214 $214 $234 $234 $214 Hilton Los Angeles North/Glendale & Executive Meeting Ctr $199 $199 $199 $199 $199 $199 $199 Embassy Suites by Hilton Los Angeles Downey $165 $180 $181 $216 $252 $252 $235 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles \u2013 Rosemead $103 $127 $126 $103 $162 $156 $103 Hilton Los Angeles Airport $159 $164 $166 $167 $159 $175 $155 Palmer House a Hilton Hotel $304 $317 $317 $313 $287 $284 $315 Hilton Chicago $335 $310 $316 $371 $322 $308 $341 theWit Chicago \u2013 a DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel $239 $245 $236 $216 $180 $238 $214 Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave $218 $213 $224 $230 $250 $250 $274 Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown River North $202 $206 $214 $302 $314 $314 $296 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago \u2013 Magnificent Mile $196 $205 $256 $278 $296 $296 $269 Embassy Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile $223 $223 $252 $278 $324 $324 $278 Hilton Chicago/Magnificent Mile Suites $178 $191 $198 $216 $255 $261 $215 The Drake $156 $166 $170 $169 $228 $233 $176 DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Midway Airport $184 $184 $188 $188 $197 $197 $188 Hampton Inn & Suites Tempe/Phoenix Airport $165 $176 $175 $148 $141 $141 $132 Embassy Suites by Hilton Phoenix Downtown North $240 $274 $265 $265 $274 $274 $224 Hampton Inn Phoenix-Midtown-Downtown Area $253 $280 $275 $226 $218 $213 $218 DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Phoenix $179 $179 $179 $179 $179 $179 $179 Embassy Suites by Hilton Phoenix Airport $223 $228 $223 $222 $223 $228 $222 Hilton Phoenix Airport $179 $179 $179 $179 $183 $169 $165 Embassy Suites by Hilton Phoenix Biltmore $304 $306 $303 $242 $230 $225 $241 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Phoenix Tempe $136 $140 $148 $155 $142 $142 $150 Hampton Inn & Suites Phoenix Tempe $149 $162 $155 $173 $146 $159 $162 Senna House Scottsdale, Curio Collection by Hilton $361 $429 $450 $424 $464 $505 $382 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Center City $184 $200 $192 $181 $184 $204 $190 Hampton Inn Philadelphia Center City-Convention Center $232 $232 $232 $232 $271 $282 $190 The Logan Philadelphia, Curio Collection by Hilton $264 $261 $259 $240 $257 $319 $240 Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue $185 $187 $190 $184 $190 $212 $181 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Airport $141 $141 $144 $156 $160 $163 $131 Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Airport $152 $157 $190 $195 $251 $224 $144 DoubleTree by Hilton Cherry Hill Philadelphia $117 $117 $107 $107 $150 $161 $119 DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Mt.

            "text": "Chicago health official defends denial of Southeast Side metal shredder's permit\n\nThe city of Chicago has denied a permit for Southside Recycling, formerly General Iron, to operate a scrapyard on Chicago's Southeast Side.\n\nCHICAGO -- A top Chicago health official testified Wednesday that the denial of a Southeast Side metal shredder's permit was decided on multiple factors, including residents' concerns about cumulative air pollution and high rates of chronic diseases in the surrounding community.\n\nMegan Cunningham, managing deputy commissioner of the city's public health department, said that a comprehensive analysis of the health and environmental factors of three neighborhoods, East Side, Hegewisch and South Deering, persuaded Chicago officials to reject an application to open a car and scrap metal shredding facility on East 116th Street along the Calumet River.\n\n\"Our goal is to protect and promote public health,\" Cunningham said during a city administrative hearing over the rejected permit. \"Community conditions are themselves a result of policies.\"\n\nCunningham added that city officials were concerned about the \"inherent risk\" that large scrap metal operations posed, including potential explosions.\n\n\"A permit is only as strong as a company's willingness to abide by it,\" Cunningham said, defending the permit denial last February.\n\nRELATED | CPS teachers who participated in General Iron protests with students given warning\n\nReserve Management Group, the business that owns the shredding operation, wants an administrative law judge to determine whether the city exceeded its authority in denying the permit for the relocated and rebranded General Iron operation that was reconstructed on the Southeast Side after moving from its longtime home in Lincoln Park.\n\nGeneral Iron was acquired by an affiliate of Reserve Management in 2019 after it signed an agreement with the city that laid out a timeline for closing the Lincoln Park facility and moving it to the Southeast Side. Even as community members protested the move, holding demonstrations and even a hunger strike, Reserve Management built a new shredding operation - at an estimated cost of $80 million - confident that it would get city approval.\n\nOn cross examination, Reserve Management lawyer Jeffrey Rossman asked Cunningham a series of questions related to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's involvement in the shredder permit, a related civil rights investigation by federal housing officials and Mayor Lori Lightfoot's possible influence in the matter.\n\nThe permit denial was made by Lightfoot appointee Dr. Allison Arwady, who heads the Chicago Department of Public Health.\n\nBut it was Lightfoot who put a pause on the process in May 2021 after EPA Administrator Michael Regan, appointed by President Joe Biden, recommended a health impact analysis be conducted to determine if an already environmentally overburdened community would suffer as a result of added pollution.\n\nREAD MORE | City denies permit for scrapyard planning move to SE Side over pollution concerns\n\nReserve Management's lawyers have argued that the health impact assessment should not have been part of the process.\n\nCunningham said such health assessments are being conducted routinely across the country and that they allowed her department to take a more comprehensive approach to deciding the permit.\n\nSome of the factors that influenced the city decisions included the high levels of particle pollution common on the Southeast Side, the lack of access to health care and high rates of chronic heart disease and other illnesses, she said.\n\nRossman compared a zoning board's approvals for the shredding site in 2019 to those of the health department's assessment.\n\nHe noted advanced pollution controls that were put in place for the rebuilt General Iron.\n\nSEE ALSO | General Iron looks to return to Lincoln Park after permit denied, residents complain of pollution\n\nRossman also questioned why a rival metal shredder, Sims Metal Management, was able to continue to operate in Pilsen without adequate pollution controls.\n\nSims, which has run afoul of federal environmental laws, is building new pollution controls and must get a city operating permit.\n\nIt's not clear that the judge deciding the permit matter is going to be persuaded.\n\nAdministrative law Judge Mitchell Ex has repeatedly asked Reserve Management lawyers to not stray too far afield from the defining question: Did Arwady appropriately follow the rules when she denied the operating permit last February?\n\nReserve Management's lawyers asked for a subpoena of Arwady to testify at an upcoming hearing, a request Ex said he would consider. Last year, Ex turned down the same lawyers' request to take a deposition from the public health commissioner.\n\nThe video in the player above is from a previous report.\n\nBrett Chase's reporting on the environment and public health is made possible by a grant from The Chicago Community Trust.\n\nSource: ( Sun-Times Media Wire - Copyright Chicago Sun-Times 2023.)",

He\u2019s a 1995 graduate of New Trier High School in the suburbs and has run noteworthy restaurants in France and in the U.S. He\u2019s best known for Le Coucou in New York, which earned a Michelin star in 2019. He seems determined to grow his brand. Beyond Le Select, which is slated to open on Saturday, January 28 at 504 N. Wells Street in River North, Rose and Boka also opened a restaurant together last month in LA.\n\nAt Le Select, Rose and Boka imagine a bustling brasserie with diners enjoying dishes like roasted poultry (not just chicken, there\u2019s been a recent push for Americans to enjoy more quail and squab), steak au poivre, and pat\u00e9 en croute. The second floor will also hold a bar aimed at the after-dinner crowd called Bar 504, according to a news release.\n\nBoka has deployed AvroKO to redesign the space that once called the infamous sports bar Bottled Blonde and Sushi SambaRio home. As Rose will split his time across the country and at his Paris restaurant, La Bourse et La Vie, Boka has made some marquee hires. Industry vet Jason Heiman, last seen at Santo in Nashville (Chicagoans may know him from Pork Shoppe, Bangers & Lace, or Tizi Melloul) is the chef de cuisine. Boka VP of Operations Troy Weissmann worked with Rose at Le Coucou. Cara Sandoval, who co-founded two-Michelin-starred Oriole in West Loop, is the service director. GM Kevin Roskoskey is a former managing partner with Scott Harris Hospitality.\n\nCheck back for more coverage of the restaurant next week.\n\nLe Select, 504 N.

Wacker Drive \u2013 Rooftop\n\nSkender has announced the completion of the capital improvement program at 225 W. Wacker Drive, a 615,000-square-foot Class A office tower in Chicago. Cushman & Wakefield was in charge of management and represented the property\u2019s owner, Spear Street Capital.\n\nAccording to CommercialEdge, Spear Street purchased the 31-story building in 2020 for $210 million. The company appointed Skender as the general contractor of three different construction projects at the property, including upgrades to the lower lobby and Franklin Street entrance, fourth-floor amenity space and roof deck.\n\nSkender worked together with Valerio Dewalt Train as architect, Kohn Pederson Fox Associates as designer and Oehme Van Sweden as the appointed landscape architect of the rooftop terrace.\n\nProject details\n\nThe first phase of the renovation focused on the tower\u2019s tenant amenity floor, which has been transformed into a luxury space equipped with Skyfold partitions for conferences, high-quality audio and visual equipment, green areas and a commissioned art collection that is paying tribute to Chicago River, incorporating different minerals.\n\nConnected to the property\u2019s fourth-floor interior, the redesigned open terrace features vegetation with drainage and water filtration systems, curtainwall openings and a new vestibule space. Using high-end materials, the Skender team also redesigned the lobby while keeping the space fully functioning for office tenants.\n\nWood was used for the building\u2019s flooring, an overhead slab was cut to achieve double-ceiling heights and the tower\u2019s exterior now offers a new curtainwall on the Wacker Drive side.\n\nThe renovation began in 2021 and was mostly complete by November 2022. The office property is now a revitalized asset that can accommodate tenants\u2019 hybrid work needs. The tower has also received a LEED Recertification, reaching the Gold level status as of October 2022, according to USGBC.\n\nEarlier in 2022, Skender, together with JLL Construction acted as general contractors for a 200,000-square-foot office building in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market. Completed in 13 months, Sterling Bay\u2019s project was designed to achieve LEED certification. According to a recent Commercial Property Executive listicle, Illinois had more than 7.8 million square feet of LEED-certified office space during the first half of 2022, representing 6.7 percent of the total national volume. Chicago had 7.3 million square feet of office space that achieved the green certification, including a LEED Platinum award.",

He previously had been administrator for the village of Plainfield for 12 years, and was ousted in the spring of 2021 with the election of a new mayor. After that, he briefly served as interim community development director in Fox Lake, according to biographical information on him.\n\nWalsh, 29, has been River Forest\u2019s Assistant to the Village Administrator since April. A Forest Park native and current Chicago resident, Walsh was previously interim village manager in Homer Glen for about a year and prior to that was the assistant to the village manager in Homer Glen for 18 months, according to his bio.\n\nAmong Walsh\u2019s past work is having been elected to be a Park District commissioner in Forest Park in 2013, when he was just 20 years old. He served in that role for more than eight years until resigning in August 2021.\n\nNow \u2014 at least on an interim basis \u2014 Walsh will assume the top operational job for River Forest.\n\n\u201cI am very excited about the opportunity,\u201d Walsh told Pioneer Press. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that I didn\u2019t have longer to work with Brian Murphy, and I am surprised and excited to have the opportunity of the interim role.\u201d\n\nAsked if he will put his name forth to be considered for the village administrator job on a permanent basis, Walsh demurred.\n\n\u201cI think for now, I\u2019m just going to take it one day at a time and see what the (Village) Board\u2019s expectations are,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving that (interim) experience (in the past), I know what to expect with that role.\u201d\n\nGoldsborough is a freelance reporter.",

            "text": "by Emily Mack\n\nIt was another unusual year in Illinois real estate as sales slipped while prices remained high. New data from the Mainstreet Organization of REALTORS\u00ae outlines the details across Chicagoland.\n\nAccording to Mainstreet, a total of 35,741 single-family suburban homes were sold during 2022: a 22.5% decrease year over year. But continued low inventory kept prices up. The median sales price for a detached suburban home rose 5.5% to $343,000 in 2022.\n\nThe suburbs which saw the steepest sales declines throughout 2022 were, in order: River Grove (down 37.9%), Glen Ellyn (down 37.3%), Roselle (down 36.4%), Long Grove \u2013 Lake Zurich \u2013 Hawthorn Woods \u2013 Kildeer (down 35.1%), Bartlett (down 34.7%), Streamwood (down 33.6%), Wood Dale (down 33.3%), Oak Brook (down 33.1%), Bloomingdale (down 31.5%), Willowbrook (down 31.4%), Oswego and Vernon Hills (both down 31.1%), Hainesville \u2013 Grayslake and Rolling Meadows and Niles (all down 31%), ) Batavia (down 30.9%), Keeneyville \u2013 Lombard (down 30.8%), Mundelein (down 30.7%), Palatine (down 30.4%) and Arlington Heights (down 30.0%).\n\nMeanwhile, in December 2022 alone, 2,172 single-family homes were sold, down 38.2% year over year, with the median sale prices increased 1% to $315,000.\n\n\u201cLast year started out with the pandemic \u2026 where buyers were actively pursuing home purchases and the market was really competitive,\u201d Mainstreet President Debbie Pawlowicz said in a press release. \u201c[But] it ended with continued low inventory and higher interest rates, aiming at a more balanced market.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Dr. Anthony Chan, the chief economist and chairman of Chan Economics LLC, predicted a mild recession in the back half of 2023. He shared those thoughts recently at Mainstreet\u2019s 2023 Economic Outlook Breakfast\n\n\u201cWe know that we get a recession every 5.3 years, on average, certainly over the last 60 years. But a recession only lasts an average of 10.3 months,\u201d Chan said. \u201cThis is a bump in the road, but it\u2019s not a permanent bump. Things are going to get better eventually.\u201d He also predicted that interest rates will not exceed 4.4% by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see what 2023 brings, but I do think there is some seasonality returning to the market,\u201d Mainstreet President Debbie Pawlowicz concluded in the press release.",

So whether you\u2019re a newcomer or a longtime resident, impress your friends and family with these must-know Boston fun facts.\n\n1. The microwave was accidentally invented in Boston\n\nRaytheon Engineer Percy Spencer invented the microwave in 1945; however, it wasn\u2019t his intention to. He didn\u2019t make the connection to food until he accidentally melted chocolate that was left in his pocket. Raytheon released the first microwave oven in 1947.\n\n2. The first U.S. lighthouse was built here in 1716\n\nLocated on Little Brewster Island, the historic Boston Light was first lit on September 14, 1716. Although the original lighthouse was partially destroyed when the British took over the island, a new tower was constructed in 1783 and still stands today.\n\n3. Happy Hour isn\u2019t allowed in Boston\n\nThroughout a majority of the U.S., \u201cHappy Hour\u201d often includes a range of both food and drink specials. Not in Boston, though. Massachusetts banned time-limited drink specials in 1984 after a string of drunk driving accidents. However, in recent years, there has been a strong push to \u201cbring back Happy Hour\u201d across the state.\n\n4. The first subway line was created in the 1890s in Boston\n\nBuilt during the second wave of the Industrial Revolution in Massachusetts, this invention helped ease the street congestion Boston was facing. This set the stage for public transportation in America.\n\n5. You can actually drive 90 feet below the surface of Boston Harbor\n\nThe Ted Williams Tunnel is 1.6 miles long and the deepest vehicular tunnel in North America. It\u2019s named after the Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams.\n\n6. The first U.S. college was founded in the Greater Boston area\n\nFounded in 1636, Harvard University is the \u201coldest institution of higher education\u201d and is one of the most prestigious universities to this day. It\u2019s located in Cambridge, which is just under twenty minutes outside of downtown Boston.\n\n7. Over 2 million gallons of molasses flooded the North End in 1919\n\nThis deadly accident took the lives of 21 people, several horses, and injured over 100 others.\n\n8. The first-ever chocolate factory opened its doors in Boston\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t Willy Wonka who opened the factory. In 1780, James Baker founded The Baker Chocolate Company and was headquartered in Dorchester, Boston.\n\n9. In 1990, the world\u2019s largest art heist occurred in Boston\n\n13 pieces of art were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in just 81 minutes. The stolen collection is valued at $500 million.\n\n10. Boston is the only state whose capital is located along a coastline\n\nThe stunning city of Boston boasts 47 miles of ocean coastline. A mix of beaches, bays, harbors, ports, and peninsulas constitute the greater Boston Harbor. Boston is also surrounded by several small islands, such as Long Island and Governors Island.",

Whether you\u2019re a longtime resident of the city or you\u2019re new to the area, this list of fun facts about Washington DC is sure to educate and entertain you. From the city\u2019s founding to its iconic landmarks, there\u2019s plenty to learn about this fascinating city.\n\n1. The gorgeous cherry blossoms were a gift of friendship from the People of Japan\n\nIn 1912, around 3,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington DC from Japan. Now each spring, beautiful pink cherry blossoms lining the Tidal Basin bloom and draw in both locals and tourists to appreciate the gorgeous scenery. The National Cherry Blossom Festival takes place over four weekends and brings in hundreds of thousands of visitors.\n\n2. The first President to live in the White House wasn\u2019t George Washington\n\nThe second President of the United States, John Adams, was actually the first to live in the White House. This is because construction of the White House wasn\u2019t finished until a year after George Washington passed.\n\n3. DC is home to the largest library in the world\n\nThe Library of Congress may only consist of three buildings, but it has the most shelf space and number of volumes than any other library. If English isn\u2019t your native language, don\u2019t worry \u2013 around half of the books in the Library are in another language. It also holds the largest rare-book collection in North America, with more than 700,000 volumes. So if you\u2019re a bookworm or a history buff, there\u2019s bound to be something of interest for you here.\n\n4. Washington, DC is smaller than the smallest state in the country, Rhode Island\n\nDC is approximately 68 square miles and could actually fit into the state of Rhode Island 22.6 times.\n\n5. There was a \u201ctypo\u201d carved into the Lincoln Memorial\n\nInstead of carving \u201cFUTURE,\u201d it was misspelled and instead \u201cEUTURE\u201d was chiseled into the monument. Although it has now been corrected, if you look closely, you can see where the mistake was covered up.\n\n6. DC actually gets more rain than Seattle\n\nOn average, Washington DC gets about 40 inches of rainfall each year, while Seattle averages 38 inches a year.\n\n7. One of the oldest operating open air fish markets is located at The Wharf\n\nThe Municipal Fish Market opened in 1805 and remains an iconic destination for both tourists and those living in DC. Open daily, the market features a range of seafood vendors offering freshly caught fish, oysters, shrimp, and more. There are nearby plazas and parks, restaurants, and bars at The Wharf to enjoy after shopping around the market.\n\n8. There are over 70 museums in DC\n\nWhether you\u2019re intrigued by American history, an arts lover, or both \u2013 there\u2019s bound to be a handful of museums that are up your alley in Washington DC. Some of the most visited museums include the National Museum of Natural History, the National Gallery of Art, the National Air and Space Museum, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. You\u2019ll also find interesting museums with unique exhibits and collections, like the International Spy Museum and the National Post Museum.\n\n9. Although it may look small from afar, the Statue of Freedom is over 19 feet tall and weighs a whopping 15,000 pounds\n\nOn the top of the U.S. Capitol building, you\u2019ll find a bronze statue of a woman wearing a helmet with an eagle head and feathers. While it may look like your average-sized statue, don\u2019t be fooled.\n\n10. The Washington Monument was the tallest building in the world from 1884 to 1889\n\nWhen it was first constructed, it became the tallest structure in the world, but that title only lasted about five years until the Eiffel Tower was built. Another interesting fact about the Washington Monument is that it\u2019s actually two colors. It was constructed in two phases and once they began the second phase, nearly two decades later, they weren\u2019t able to match the quarry stone. So, you\u2019ll notice that the monument is a lighter shade at the bottom and darker at the top.",
