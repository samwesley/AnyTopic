They\u2019re still fifth in the Central Division, but they\u2019ve gotten to within three points of a wild card spot. St. Louis would still have to jump the Colorado Avalanche and knockout either the Calgary Flames or Edmonton Oilers, so it\u2019s definitely an uphill battle for the Blues to make the postseason.\n\nView from the other side Blues blog, St. Louis Game Time\n\nGood news for the Blues is that they\u2019re on a decent streak right now. They\u2019re currently in the midst of a seven-game homestead, having gone 3-2-0 so far and riding a two-game win streak. The latter two wins weren\u2019t against particularly difficult opponents \u2014 the Ottawa Senators and Nashville Predators \u2014 but the Blues did defeat them both convincingly. The 5-2 victory over the Predators was especially important and impressive because it knocked Nashville down a spot in the standings, and the Blues owned 61.84 percent of the shot attempt share and 55.68 of the expected goals share at 5-on-5. It was easily the Blues\u2019 most dominating performance of the season.\n\nDuring the Predators game, the Blues managed to get goals from five different scorers: Jordan Kyrou, Robert Thomas, Brayden Schenn, Brandon Saad, and Alexey Toropchenko. As is typical for the Blues, most of those names are from the top-six, but the team has been getting production chipped in from their lower lines more lately than they were even a month ago.\n\nThe team leaders during the last five games have been expected ones: Kyrou and Thomas both have two goals and three assists while Buchnevich added two goals and two assists himself. But typically lower-line forwards like Jake Neighbours (2 G, 1 A) and Tyler Pitlick (1 G, 2 A) have contributed in that span as well.\n\nAnother area of weakness for the Blues right now is their health: they have six players on injured reserve, including some pretty important names. Ryan O\u2019Reilly is out with a broken foot, Vladimir Tarasenko is still recuperating from a hand injury, Robert Bortuzzo and Torey Krug both have undisclosed lower-body injuries. Some of these players have returned to practicing with their team but are not expected to play against the Blackhawks. Tarasenko and Krug, in particular, have been big losses as they\u2019re both top-six producers for the Blues this season.\n\nThe Blues and Blackhawks have faced off twice already this season, with the Blues being victorious both times: first a 5-2 win on Nov. 16 and then a 3-1 victory on Dec. 29. Despite the score in the second game, it wasn\u2019t that close, as the Blues dominated in every shot category. St. Louis has gotten moderately worse on the power play (23.5 percent to 22.9 percent) but slightly better on the penalty kill (71.4 percent to 74.1 percent) since the last meeting. If the Blackhawks want a chance to get their first win against St. Louis this season, taking advantage in the special teams battle could be one key road to victory.\n\nTale of the tape (statistics from this season)\n\nBlackhawks \u2014 Statistic \u2014 Blues\n\n42.67% (32nd) \u2014 5-on-5 Corsi For \u2014 45.66% (28th)\n\n41.10% (31st) \u2014 5-on-5 Expected goals for \u2014 46.45% (25th)\n\n2.37 (31st) \u2014 Goals per game \u2014 3.11 (18th)\n\n3.63 (27th) \u2014 Goals against per game \u2014 3.50 (25th)\n\n56.2% (1st) \u2014 Faceoffs \u2014 50.4% (14th)\n\n20.3% (23rd) \u2014 Power play \u2014 22.9% (14th)\n\n74.8% (23rd) \u2014 Penalty kill \u2014 74.1% (25th)\n\nHow to watch\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. CT\n\nWhere: Enterprise Center, St. Louis\n\nTV: NBC Sports Chicago\n\nRadio: WGN 720\n\nLive stream: Sling TV", "title": "River Deep, Mountain High: Blackhawks at Blues", "keywords": ["river", "blackhawks", "high", "theyre", "louis", "deep", "goals", "blues", "team", "st", "win", "mountain", "game", "expected"], "link": "https://www.secondcityhockey.com/2023/1/21/23564890/chicago-blackhawks-st-louis-blues-january-21-2023-regular-season-time-preview-tv-info-lineup", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": ", Hulu + Live TV, FuboTV\n\n3/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 0}, "1": {"text": "Tanteo Tequila, the only distillery owned by its co-op of agave farmers, is bringing back their annual, nationwide river clean-up initiative to commemorate National Spicy Margarita Week.\n\nFrom January 23 - 30, Tanteo will be making the below donations:\n\nOn-Premise: donating $1 for every spicy margarita sold in participating venues.\n\nOff-Premise: Partnering with Agalima in FL, TX and CA for every bottle of Tanteo + Agalima purchased together Tanteo will donate $5\n\nE-comm: 10% of proceeds to Un Salto Con Destino\n\nInstagram: $1 to Un Salto Con Destino for every photo shared using the hashtag #nationalspicymargday and tagging Tanteo *on 1/26 only\n\nThe full list of charities and their respective regions below:\n\nTanteo Tequila is available in Jalapen\u0303o, Chipotle and Habanero expressions, Their tequila has solidified their category dominance as the original spicy tequila.\n\nFor more information, please visit https://www.tanteotequila.com/national-spicy-margarita-day\n\nPhoto Credit: Courtesy of Tanteo Tequila", "title": "TANTEO TEQUILA Brings Back River Clean-Up Initiative", "keywords": ["initiative", "river", "visit", "venuesoffpremise", "margarita", "tanteo", "salto", "using", "spicy", "cleanup", "brings", "agalima", "weekfrom", "tequila"], "link": "https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwfood-wine/article/TANTEO-TEQUILA-Brings-Back-River-Clean-Up-Initiative-20230120", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n2/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 2}, "2": {"text": "Indigenous tribe's river name to be restored under proposed bill\n\nCity Pier on the Thames River is illuminated at dawn in New London, Connecticut, Jan. 21, 2022.\n\nCity Pier on the Thames River is illuminated at dawn in New London, Connecticut, Jan. 21, 2022.\n\nCity Pier on the Thames River is illuminated at dawn in New London, Connecticut, Jan. 21, 2022.\n\nCity Pier on the Thames River is illuminated at dawn in New London, Connecticut, Jan. 21, 2022.\n\nA state representative wants to restore a piece of Connecticut's pre-colonial history to one of its major rivers.\n\nState Rep.

Wade on Sunday. It's a bitter historical milestone for the White House after the U.S. Supreme Court rolled back the national right to abortion.\n\nAdministration officials said she'll speak in Florida, where Democrats have been on guard for new efforts to restrict abortion from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate. The speech is a continuation of Harris' focus on reproductive rights in recent months, including meetings with activists, healthcare providers and state lawmakers from around the country.\n\nIt's also intended to be a signal that abortion remains a focus for the administration after the midterm elections. Democrats performed better than expected, but prospects for codifying Roe v. Wade into law haven't improved, and the administration has bumped up against the limits of its legal ability to keep abortion available.\n\n\u201cThe vice president will make very clear: The fight to secure women\u2019s fundamental right to reproductive health care is far from over,\u201d said a statement from Kirsten Allen, a Harris spokesperson. \u201cShe will lay out the consequences of extremist attacks on reproductive freedom in states across our country and underscore the need for Congress to codify Roe.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden will mark the anniversary with a proclamation, according to administration officials.\n\nNo additional executive actions or policy proposals are expected over the weekend. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday that \u201cthe administration has taken actions with our limited authorities,\" reiterating the president's call for national legislation.\n\n\u201cWomen must be empowered to make decisions about their own lives and health care, and those decisions should not be politicized or second guessed by politicians,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, told reporters on Wednesday that her organization will be focusing on state legislation and asking, \u201cWhat is the most ambitious we can be?\u201d\n\nDannenfelser recently met with DeSantis and said she was \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d with the conversation, although she said DeSantis didn't know what his next steps on abortion would be. Florida currently bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra plans to visit Minnesota this week as that state's legislature works on a new law to solidify abortion rights.\n\nBecerra expects to appear with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, stop at a Planned Parenthood facility and meet with organizers who want to use a mobile van to provide abortions to people who cross into the state from Wisconsin, which has strict abortion limits.\n\nBecerra then plans to visit a Wisconsin clinic that's no longer allowed to provide abortions and hold an event with Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Gwen Moore, both Democrats, to talk with medical students.\n\nOn Wednesday, Becerra recalled visiting a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis, Missouri, on the day that Roe v. Wade was overturned. He said he was shocked to see how quickly women were turned away for scheduled abortion appointments. Then he stopped at a clinic over the border in neighboring Illinois, which was still accepting patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now a fact in America that you can drive 16 miles across state lines and lose the rights to health care you need,\u201d Becerra said.\n\nIt's likely that the battle over reproductive rights will focus more on state legislatures than Washington, where the two parties appear deadlocked on the issue.\n\nDemocrats have 51 seats in the Senate, which means they can block any Republican attempts to ban abortion nationwide, but there's not enough support to sidestep filibuster rules to restore a national right to abortion.\n\nIn addition, the administration has limited tools to take executive action, although it's worked to make abortion pills more widely available.", "title": "Vice President Harris to Push Abortion Fight in Florida on Roe Anniversary", "keywords": ["democrats", "roe", "harris", "right", "vice", "anniversary", "push", "state", "administration", "fight", "rights", "abortion", "florida", "reproductive", "wade", "v", "president"], "link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/vice-president-harris-to-push-abortion-fight-in-florida-on-roe-anniversary-/6927129.html", "skip": "true", "gpt_score_reason": "\n\n0/10", "gpt_relevancy_score": 0}, "6": {"text": "DOWNTOWN \u2014 The latest addition to Chicago\u2019s Downtown skyline turned out to be far too bright to handle.\n\nSalesforce, the San-Francisco based software firm, lit up its large logo this month atop Wolf Point Tower, a new 60-story building that sits where the Chicago River splits into its North and South branches.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for blinded neighbors to weigh in, filing complaints and taking to Twitter to sound off on the sign\u2019s intensity.\n\nThat caused Ald.

It conforms with the city\u2019s high-rise sign regulations, according to Peter Strazzabosco, deputy commissioner with the Department of Planning and Development.\n\n\u201cThe City\u2019s sign code does not regulate lumens but it does say signs can\u2019t be a nuisance to nearby properties,\u201d Strazzabosco wrote in a statement.\n\nBecause of this, Reilly typically requests that these types of signs be installed with dimmers, his spokesman said.\n\nStrazzabosco confirmed Friday that Salesforce had turned down the sign\u2019s brightness and agreed to a new \u201cdaily illumination schedule.\u201d\n\nSalesforce will be the anchor tenant of the tower at 343 W.

They\u2019ve since met that goal, although the company announced this month it will cut 8,000 employees and close some locations, according to the Tribune.\n\nSalesforce is expected to move into Wolf Point this year, according to CoStar.\n\nSubscribe to Block Club Chicago, an independent, 501(c)(3), journalist-run newsroom.

Johnson, who has criticized Lightfoot for running as a progressive and then breaking campaign promises, wants to shift money away from the police department and toward better mental health care and other services for long-neglected neighborhoods like the one where he lives on the city\u2019s West Side.\n\nLightfoot has also clashed with the Chicago police union, the Fraternal Order of Police. At a City Council meeting, Lightfoot was caught on a microphone referring to a union leader as \u201cthis FOP clown.\u201d\n\nThe police union has endorsed mayoral candidate Paul Vallas, a former city budget director and schools leader who served as an adviser to the police union during negotiations with City Hall. He\u2019s repeatedly called for more police officers, saying, \u201cCrime is out of control.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLightfoot has criticized Vallas as a Republican in disguise, noting he has received campaign contributions from GOP donors. Her campaign blasted him for being too cozy with the police union, calling its leader a \u201cnotorious bigot\u201d and supporter of former President Donald Trump.\n\nLightfoot has increased her support in some areas of the city. Former Rep. Bobby Rush, a major critic during her first campaign turned prominent booster this year, joined Reps. Danny Davis and Robin Kelly \u2014 whose districts include predominantly Black neighborhoods \u2014 in praising her commitment to investing in the areas. Lightfoot maintained that commitment, Rush said, even \u201cunder the toughest of circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe mayor points to a record of achievements that include pushing through a $15 minimum wage that labor unions had sought for years and approval of a long-sought casino that\u2019s expected to bring millions in revenue and thousands of jobs. She also has budgeted over $3 million to protect access to abortion, including for people who travel to Chicago from states where the procedure is illegal.\n\nIn addition to Garcia, Vallas and Johnson, the other candidates running are wealthy businessman Willie Wilson, Chicago City Council members Sophia King and Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and state Rep. Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected by deleting the reference to Atlanta as among the major cities electing a mayor in 2023.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "title": "She made history as Chicago mayor.

It\u2019s also about ghosts and bad dreams and trying to move forward and climbing over a mountain and hoping to glimpse the other side.\n\n\u201cOver the years there\u2019s been a lot of geography in my music, a lot of landscapes. Sometimes the places are real, sometimes they\u2019re emotional. I\u2019ve always liked the idea of songs and albums that exist in a continuum with one another. I\u2019m not talking about some kind of deep series of concept albums, mind you. More like the idea that my songs are all pretty much tributaries of the same river. Which makes a lot of metaphorical sense because my path has been long and winding and often slow and muddy. But always moving towards the sea.
