Another fellow Emirati, Sultan al-Neyadi, will also make a voyage to the space station later this month.\n\nNicknamed the \"Sultan of Space\", the 41-year-old Neyadi will become the first Arab astronaut to spend six months in space when he blasts off for the ISS aboard a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nGulf monarchies have been seeking to diversify their energy-reliant economies through a plethora of projects.\n\nSaudi de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has also been trying to shake off the kingdom's austere image through a push for reforms.\n\nSince his rise to power in 2017, women have been allowed to drive and to travel abroad without a male guardian, and their proportion in the workforce has more than doubled since 2016, from 17 percent to 37 percent.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foray into space is not its first, however.\n\nIn 1985, Saudi royal Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, an air force pilot, took part in a US-organized space mission, becoming the first Arab Muslim to travel into space.\n\nIn 2018, Saudi Arabia set up a space program and last year launched another to send astronauts into space, all part of Prince Salman's Vision 2030 agenda for economic diversification.\n\nAxiom Space carried out its first private astronaut mission to the ISS in April 2022. Four private astronauts spent 17 days in orbit as part of Ax-1.\n\n",

File photo courtesy of NASA\n\nFeb. 13 (UPI) -- The crew for NASA's next privately-funded mission to space has been selected as the agency moves closer toward commercializing space travel. Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut, will be in command of Axiom Mission 2, which will be piloted by businessman John Shoffner, NASA said in a press release released Monday. Ali Alqarni and Rayyanah Barnawi, members of Saudi Arabia's first national astronaut program, will serve as specialists for the mission. Advertisement\n\nCommercial space technology company Axiom Space is funding the mission, which will send the crew to the International Space Station on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. They will spend 10 days at the space station taking part in several activities, including commercial and outreach activities.\n\n\"Axiom Space's second private astronaut mission to the International Space Station cements our mission of expanding access to space worldwide and supporting the growth of the low-Earth orbit economy as we build Axiom Station,\" said Michael Suffredini, president and CEO of Axiom Space.\n\nAX-2 will be a mission of firsts. It will be the first to include astronauts who are part of a foreign government agency and it will be the first commercial mission with a woman at the command position, NASA said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhitson has spent 665 days in space -- a U.S. record -- and embarked on 10 spacewalks.\n\n\"I'm honored to be heading back to the station for the fourth time, leading this talented Ax-2 crew on their first mission,\" said Whitson.\n\n\"This is a strong and cohesive team determined to conduct meaningful scientific research in space and inspire a new generation about the benefits of microgravity. It's a testament to the power of science and discovery to unify and build international collaboration.\"\n\nThe first Axiom Space and NASA mission, Ax-1, was completed last April. The mission was scheduled to last 10 days but weather conditions kept the crew in space for an extra week.\n\nNASA said private astronaut missions are a step toward privately funded commercial space stations. The agency is examining proposals for more private missions.",

            "text": "Just like fashioning decorative shapes and figures using the Japanese art of folding paper, tracing when and where origami originated is complicated. But what cannot be disputed is its incredible influence in modern engineering.\n\nWhile styles of origami can be incredibly diverse, the art is rooted in mathematical principles that make it applicable to science and industry.\n\nThe ability to fold two-dimensional structures into complex, yet compact three-dimensional shapes is especially valuable to space sciences and missions, where it pays to keep payloads small.\n\nPanel arrays on satellites must be folded down into compact forms in order to pack them into a relatively narrow rocket, and only unfurled to form large flat surfaces once the rocket has blasted into outer space. It\u2019s thought that the first origami solar array was packed into a Japanese spacecraft that launched in 1995. This was accomplished using the Miura fold, which is a method of folding a flat surface into a smaller area and named after astrophysicist Koryo Miura. A form of rigid origami, where a material only bends at pre-specified fold lines, the crease patterns of the Miura fold form a tessellation of the surface by parallelograms.\n\nScientists at Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are putting origami to a similar use to help capture images of planets outside our solar system by developing \u2018Starshade\u2019, a shield for use on space telescopes.\n\nStarlight can prevent space telescopes from imaging the low-intensity light reflected off exoplanets. In the same way as we shield our eyes from the glare of the Sun by placing our hand at arm\u2019s length in front of our face, this new device could shield a telescope\u2019s camera from the light of a distant star. The concept is known as the Hybrid Observatory for Earth-like Exoplanets. Flying tens of thousands of kilometres in front of a space telescope, Starshade\u2019s precise design would block light from a star so the telescope might be able to capture an image of the planets around the star.\n\nThe sunflower-shaped shade of the proposed Starshade is designed to be 36m in diameter but must fold down to less than 2.5m in diameter when stowed for launch. Origami concepts have been used to help work out the stow pattern. Experts developed algorithms allowing them to input specs, press enter and create a new pattern instead of having to make models and refold them over and over again.\n\nStarshade is still in development and details are far from finalised, but you can make your own paper origami model of Starshade\u2019s inner disc optical shield by following instructions on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory website.\n\nConcepts from origami are shaping medical research and the creation of medical devices. Researchers at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Misfolding Diseases, including Ryan Geiser, a PhD candidate who lost his grandfather to Alzheimer\u2019s, are using artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand the folding and misfolding of proteins that could unlock secrets about Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe debilitating disease affects around 57 million people worldwide. According to a leading hypothesis, it is caused by the abnormal misfolding or the build-up of proteins in and around brain cells. This build-up leads to a decrease in neurotransmitters that, over time, causes different areas of the brain to shrink, with devastating results.\n\nGeiser finds it helpful to compare folding proteins to origami. \u201cJust as paper must be folded into a particular structure to make a specific origami shape, in a cell, proteins are supposed to fold in a specific way, so each protein can carry out a certain function, with sticky spots within the protein holding the structure in place,\u201d he explains. Alzheimer\u2019s disease develops after some proteins in the brain fold incorrectly so that sticky spots are exposed outside of a protein. These toxic species can impair cell walls and create a cascade that recruits other proteins to clump together, causing a build-up that stops nutrients from reaching neurons. \u201cWithout these nutrients, along with subsequent issues, the brain cells are destroyed.\u201d\n\nGeiser is using study data and AI to identify existing drugs that might be able to slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So far, his team has identified four calcium-channel blocker drugs that may have potential to be repurposed for treating dementia, and this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cMany computational models are trying to understand \u2018origami\u2019 structures and, as computational power increases, this may become more achievable,\u201d Geiser says. Coupled with advances such as DeepMind \u2013 a subsidiary of Alphabet \u2013 releasing the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, which shares predicted structures for nearly all catalogued proteins known to science with researchers, it\u2019s likely that many more mysteries behind diseases will soon be revealed.\n\nThe use of origami in engineering is relatively new and is spurring the development of space technology, such as Nasa\u2019s \u2018Starshade\u2019, pictured here. Image credit: Nasa\n\nConcepts from origami can also be used to develop medical devices. Designs that start in a compact form and then morph into a functional form enable less invasive methods of treatment delivery, in which medical devices travel through the body to previously unreachable areas. For example, researchers at the University of Oxford developed a novel aortic heart stent to treat aneurisms that was reportedly inspired by an origami water bomb. Origami\u2019s influence can be seen in a wide range of medical devices, from an X-ray shroud to tetherless microgrippers.\n\nUsing the DNA origami method, scientists at the Centre for Structural Biology at the University of Montpellier have constructed a tiny robot to study mechanical forces applied at microscopic levels, which are crucial for many biological and pathological processes. The method enables the self-assembly of 3D nanostructures in a pre-defined form using the DNA molecule as construction material.\n\nThe researchers designed a \u2018nano-robot\u2019 approximately the size of a human cell composed of three DNA origami structures, making it possible for the first time to apply and control a force with a resolution of one piconewton, which is one-trillionth of a newton, or approximately one-trillionth of the force of a finger clicking on a pen. The team began by coupling the robot with a molecule that recognises a mechanoreceptor, which made it possible to direct the robot to some of the cells and apply forces to targeted mechanoreceptors on the surface of the cells in order to activate them.\n\nThis is the first time that a human-made, self-assembled DNA-based object can apply force with this accuracy. The tool is valuable for research as it could be used to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in cell mechanosensitivity, the dysfunction of which is involved in many diseases, including cancer.\n\nOrigami could also be used for large objects from furniture to buildings and infrastructure. Researchers from Georgia Tech, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Tokyo have developed a \u2018zippered tube\u2019 origami configuration that makes paper structures stiff enough to hold weight while still being able to fold flat for easy shipping and storage. The researchers used Miura-Ori folding to make precise, zigzag-folded strips of paper, then glued two strips together to make a tube. While the single strip of paper is highly flexible, the tube is stiffer and does not fold in as many directions. They hope their method will be applied to other thin materials, such as plastic or metal, to create furniture or buildings.\n\nIchiro Ario of Hiroshima University tested an origami-inspired Mobile Bridge Version 4.0 (MB4.0) in 2015 that he designed to assist the transport of aid to disaster zones where permanent infrastructure had been destroyed. Its scissor design relies on \u2018X\u2019 shapes to retain strength while being quickly deployed in areas where existing bridges and access points have been damaged. Tests showed it could be assembled in one hour, with the actual bridge extension taking just five minutes.\n\nResearchers at Georgia Tech are exploring whether a new class of origami- and kirigami-inspired flexible, lightweight structures could adapt to changing environmental conditions. (Kirigami is when paper is cut as well as folded.) They hope these will one day be used in a range of applications, from multifunctional robots and collapsible antennas to rapidly assembled bridges and temporary structures such as inflatable shelters.\n\nEngineers have also drawn inspiration from the art of origami to create programmable surfaces so their dimensions and corresponding properties can shift as needed. Their technique could one day be applied to aerospace and architecture, for example.\n\nTo create the structures, an international team of researchers began with cells of four kite-shaped figures, or rhombuses. Each rhombus is connected to two others along two sides, with a tail end of each rhombus free. The connecting sides are hinged in special ways, so each cell can click through a variety of forms, from a wide basket to thin folds. This means they can be combined to make a wide range of surfaces and, when the cells are adjusted, the compressibility, flexibility and density of the surface can be changed.\n\nThe technique takes advantage of a phenomenon that physicists call \u2018frustration\u2019. In geometry, frustration is a feature that stops a pattern from propagating across a wide space, like a jagged rock in a snowfield. With the adjustable cells, the researchers can introduce frustration into structures. They use this to change the properties of the surface. They can do so over wide areas and small spots.\n\nThe researchers can use these engineered frustrations to precisely change the patterns of the surface and, by doing so, they can adjust the surface\u2019s properties. \u201cUsually, a single origami pattern has one specific mechanical property,\u201d says Tomohiro Tachi, one of the researchers and a professor at the University of Tokyo. \u201cThis structure can switch between multiple states that have distinct properties. It is a universal module for programming and reprogramming materials with versatile properties.\u201d\n\nOrigami is already transforming space travel and medicine, but applying artificial intelligence to the art form could lead to more breakthroughs.\n\nWhile computers are already used to help develop folding structures, it is hard to predict whether a 3D origami design can be flattened effectively and without any damage simply by looking at it. But new work from the UvA Institute of Physics and research institute AMOLF has demonstrated that machine-learning algorithms can accurately do this, or in more technical terms, whether it can predict the properties of combinatorial mechanical metamaterials.\n\nAI should make designing new metamaterials slightly easier by reducing the need for time-consuming trial and error. The team found that even when given only a relatively small set of examples to learn from, so-called convolutional neural networks are able to accurately predict the metamaterial properties of any configuration of building blocks down to the finest detail.\n\n\u201cThis far exceeded our expectations,\u201d says PhD student Ryan van Mastrigt, who led the study. \u201cThe accuracy of the predictions shows us that the neural networks have actually learned the mathematical rules underlying the metamaterial properties, even when we don\u2019t know all the rules ourselves.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that engineers could use AI to design new complex metamaterials with useful properties, which could make everything from tiny folding medical devices, to enormous easy-to-assemble temporary infrastructure a reality.\n\nWe\u2019ll just have to wait to see what unfolds.\n\nStructure The Miura-Ori fold The Miura-Ori fold is a flat-folding technique that reduces and compresses a sheet of paper by using a tessellated crease pattern made of a series of parallelograms. It\u2019s used for everything from pop-up maps to solar arrays. In one direction, the creases lie along straight lines, with each parallelogram forming the mirror reflection of its neighbour across each crease. In the other direction, the creases zigzag, and each parallelogram is the translation of its neighbour across the crease. Each of the paths of creases consists solely of simple mountain folds or of valley folds. Miura-Ori is an example of an origami tessellation and rigid origami because each parallelogram stays flat whether it is folded or unfolded. Experts have discovered that by adding defects or changing the fold pattern of a Miura-Ori sheet slightly, they can enhance the stiffness of a sheet, allowing them to tune it to potentially switch between structural forms with different properties.",

Credits: Axiom Space\n\nNASA and its international partners have approved the crew for Axiom Space\u2019s second private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, Axiom Mission 2 (Ax-2).\n\nAxiom Space\u2019s Director of Human Spaceflight and former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson will command the privately funded mission. John Shoffner of Knoxville, Tennessee, will serve as pilot. The two mission specialists, Ali Alqarni and Rayyanah Barnawi from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), are members of the inaugural Saudi national astronaut program. They are flying through an arrangement between KSA and Axiom Space.\n\n\u201cEnabling more people to go to space is an important component of NASA\u2019s continuing efforts to grow the low-Earth orbit economy,\u201d said Angela Hart, manager of NASA\u2019s Commercial Low-Earth Orbit Development Program. \u201cPrivate astronaut missions are a key component to enable a successful transition to a model of commercially owned and operated platforms in low-Earth orbit. I appreciate the commitment of our International Space Station and commercial partners to help us achieve this future.\u201d\n\nThe Ax-2 crew will launch from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and travel to the space station. Once docked, the private astronauts plan to spend 10 days aboard the orbiting laboratory implementing a full mission of science, outreach, and commercial activities. The mission, targeted for launch in spring 2023, will be the first private space mission to include both private astronauts and astronauts representing foreign governments, as well as the first private mission commanded by a woman.\n\n\u201cAxiom Space\u2019s second private astronaut mission to the International Space Station cements our mission of expanding access to space worldwide and supporting the growth of the low-Earth orbit economy as we build Axiom Station,\u201d said Michael Suffredini, president and CEO of Axiom Space. \u201cAx-2 moves Axiom Space one step closer toward the realization of a commercial space station in low-Earth orbit and enables us to build on the legacy and achievements of the station, leveraging the benefits of microgravity to better life on Earth.\u201d\n\nWhitson will become the first female commander of a private space mission, adding to her prior accomplishments, including as NASA\u2019s chief astronaut and the first female commander of the space station. In addition, she will add to her standing record for the longest cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be heading back to the station for the fourth time, leading this talented Ax-2 crew on their first mission,\u201d said Whitson. \u201cThis is a strong and cohesive team determined to conduct meaningful scientific research in space and inspire a new generation about the benefits of microgravity. It\u2019s a testament to the power of science and discovery to unify and build international collaboration.\u201d\n\nShoffner, a businessman, has always had an interest in space, the stars, and flying, becoming a pilot at the age of 17 and since amassing than 8,500 flight hours and earning ratings for multiple aircraft types. He also is an advocate for science, technology engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education.\n\nThe first private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, Axiom Mission 1 (Ax-1), launched April 8, 2022, with four private astronauts who spent 17 days in orbit working on 26 science payloads aboard the station and conducting more than 30 STEAM educational and public outreach engagements. The crew splashed down off the coast of Florida on April 25, 2022, to conclude the mission.\n\nPrivate astronaut missions to the space station are a precursor to privately funded commercial space stations as part of NASA\u2019s efforts to develop a thriving low-Earth orbit ecosystem and marketplace. NASA is currently reviewing proposals for the third and fourth private astronaut missions to the space station.\n\nFor more than 22 years, NASA has supported a continuous U.S. human presence in low-Earth orbit aboard the space station. The agency\u2019s goal is to enable a strong, commercial marketplace in low-Earth orbit where NASA is one of many customers for private industry. This strategy will provide services the government needs at a lower cost, enabling the agency to focus on its Artemis missions to the Moon in preparation for Mars while continuing to use low-Earth orbit as a training and proving ground for those deep space missions.",

            "text": "Last week, I received a newsletter from WirtschaftsWoche entirely written by Chatgpt. The artificial intelligence-empowered chatbot developed by OpenAI analyzes large amounts of data and has a well-worded answer to almost any question. But artificial intelligence may have far more life-altering applications in space.\n\nForbes wrote on Dec. 21, 2022:\n\nArtificial intelligence \u2026 has graduated from the hype stage of the last decade and its use cases are now well documented, spanning a wide range from health-care applications to autonomous vehicles\u2014but its introduction to warfare will likely be the deciding factor in who will dominate the information age.\n\nForbes added that \u201cwhichever nation best adapts this technology to its military\u2014especially in space\u2014will open new frontiers in innovation and determine the winners and losers.\u201d The United States and China are racing to win this contest. Less noticed are Europe\u2019s space programs.\n\nAirbus, Europe\u2019s largest aeronautics and space company, is working on Europe\u2019s Future Combat Air System. The concept involves swarms of drones, fighter jets, cargo aircraft and satellites connected through artificial intelligence armed with laser weaponry.\n\nAirbus believes that artificial intelligence provides \u201ca key competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nGermany, Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse, is also increasingly becoming a hub for space operations. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed on Oct. 22, 2020, to establish a new nato Space Center at Allied Air Command in Ramstein, Germany. \u201cEvery space technology is potentially suitable for warlike purposes,\u201d Germany\u2019s tagesschau.de noted at the time.\n\nIn January 2021, the European Space Agency (esa) and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence set up a new technology transfer lab in Kaiserslautern. These include the joint development of AI systems for autonomous satellites; the interpretation of comprehensive, complex mission data; and collision avoidance capabilities, esa\u2019s website noted.\n\nThough it remains to be seen what role AI will play in space, these developments need to be closely watched. Even though they are far less noticed than the recent AI innovations, they have the potential to change our current world order.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump said at a meeting with the National Space Council on June 18, 2018. \u201cWe must have American dominance in space.\u201d\n\nIf America loses this dominance, it risks the nation\u2019s security. The U.S. military depends on its space operations, but the Bible reveals that the military will suffer a fatal blow in this regard. Ezekiel 7:14 reads, \u201cThey have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle \u2026.\u201d\n\nIn his January 1995 Trumpet personal, editor in chief Gerald Flurry explained: \u201cThe trumpet of war was blown in Israel\u2014mainly America and Britain. It seems everybody was expecting our people to go into battle. But the greatest tragedy imaginable occurred! Nobody went to battle\u2014even though the trumpet was blown!\u201d This indicates that America will lose its fighting ability likely through cyberattacks and other strategic strikes. AI warfare in space could certainly lead to this outcome. First, satellites might be trained to eliminate debris and space trash; next, they could attack other satellites.\n\nTo understand the Bible\u2019s prophecies in this regard, request Ezekiel\u2014The End-Time Prophet.",

            "text": "HELSINKI \u2014 Launches conducted by commercial Chinese launch service providers could more than double those attempted last year, according to firms\u2019 plans for 2023.\n\nThe more than 20 launches now planned by commercial launch service providers would notably eclipse the total number of orbital launches conducted by China in 2017, demonstrating the rapid growth in Chinese launch capacity and cadence in recent years.\n\nThe development could provide momentum to deployment of Chinese commercial small satellite constellations and have implications internationally for space traffic management.\n\nChina conducted a national record 64 launches in 2022, with 54 of these accounted for by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). Other actors, namely Expace, Landspace, iSpace and Galactic Energy contributed 10 more, including a pair of launch failures.\n\nCASC has declared its intentions to surpass 60 launches this year, but the companies above and a handful of new entrants are planning more than 20 launches of their own.\n\nGalactic Energy performed a fifth successful Ceres-1 launch from its fifth attempt early January, establishing itself as a leading player in the sector. It now plans a total of 8-10 launches of the light-lift solid rocket in this year. This number includes one or two launches in the second half of the year from a mobile sea platform in the Sea Yellow using infrastructure established at Haiyang, Shandong province.\n\nThe Ceres-1 rocket has a diameter of 1.4 meters, a length of about 20 meters, a mass at take-off of about 33 tons and a liquid propellant upper stage. It can deliver 400 kg to low Earth orbit (LEO) or 300 kg to a 500-kilometer-altitude sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).\n\nThe firm\u2019s Pallas-1 reusable kerosene-liquid oxygen launcher (5,000 kg to LEO, 3,000 kg to 700-km SSO) will have its test launch in 2024.\n\nMore immediately Space Pioneer (Beijing Tianbing Technology Co., Ltd) could become the first Chinese commercial launch firm to reach orbit with a liquid propellant launch vehicle. The Tianlong-2 kerosene-liquid oxygen rocket is now expected to launch from Jiuquan in Q1.\n\nCould this be China's first commercial liquid propulsion rocket to reach orbit? Space Pioneer has completed WDR tests of its first Tianlong-2 rocket at a site near Tianjin. Launch from Jiuquan in the future. https://t.co/T03y8Jj4Kh pic.twitter.com/JA8xELkbpK \u2014 Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) January 18, 2023\n\nCuriously, the firm had initially stated it was developing a rocket using HCP liquid engines, using what it called a \u2018next-generation\u2019 green, ambient temperature propellant.\n\nExpace, which operates Kuaizhou solid rockets for state-owned defense giant CASIC and its commercial space projects, is planning seven launches of its Kuaizhou-1A and larger Kuaizhou-11 rockets. Both vehicles had successful comebacks last year following failures.\n\nLandspace, one of the early movers, made the world\u2019s first orbital launch attempt of a methane-fueled launcher in December. The Zhuque-2 suffered an issue with vernier engines on its second stage, seeing the loss of the payload.\n\nHowever the company was already engaged in assembly and testing of the second Zhuque-2 before the failure and could make a relatively swift return to the pad, depending on how investigations into the failure and requisite fixes proceed. The third Zhuque-2 will use an upgraded Tianque engine without vernier engines.\n\nAnother entrant, iSpace, could return to the pad with its Hyperbola-1 solid rocket. The Beijing-based firm has however suffered three consecutive failures since becoming the first Chinese private launch service provider to send a satellite into orbit in 2019. iSpace is expected to conduct vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) tests this year for its reusable methalox Hyperbola-2 rocket.\n\nOne of a pair of the most recent Chinese launch startups, Orienspace, aims to conduct its first launch with the Gravity-1 solid rocket in the second half of 2023 using a mobile sea platform. Notably the firm says the rocket will have a payload capacity to LEO of 6.5 metric tons, making it by far the world\u2019s largest all-solid launch vehicle.\n\nORIENSPACE (\u4e1c\u65b9\u7a7a\u95f4) raised \uffe5400 million in series-A led by HIKE CAPITAL (\u5c71\u884c\u8d44\u672c). Funds will be used to develop Yinli-1 (Gravity-1) solid rocket and 100tf kerolox engine\n\nMaiden flight of Gravity-1 is planned in 2023. It has capacity of 6 tonne to LEO, 4.2 tonne to 500km SSO pic.twitter.com/8ihNDZXds0 \u2014 China 'N Asia Spaceflight \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f (@CNSpaceflight) May 20, 2022\n\nThe firm is aiming to ramp up to 10 flights of Gravity-1 across 2024-2025, while also developing new launchers.\n\nAnother new player, Rocket Pi, could launch their Darwin-1 methalox launcher this year though the timeline for this first launch is not clear.\n\nCAS Space, a spinoff from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, plans to launch three PR-1 (Lijian-1) solid rockets, following the success of its first launch in July last year. The company, also known as Zhongke Aerospace, recently outlined its longer term launch vehicle plans, including a number of familiar designs.\n\nChina Rocket, which falls under the aegis of CASC, will also be in action. It will perform more launches of its Jielong-3 rocket in 2023, which debuted with a sea launch in 2022.\n\nThe role which this new launch capability might play could be largely restricted to domestic contracts, with international export regulations limiting the sending of satellites to China for launch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect these Chinese commercial launchers to have a large effect on the international satellite launch market in the near or medium term future. In my view they are primarily targeting domestic Chinese markets or customers,\u201d Ian Christensen, director of private sector programs at the Secure World Foundation, told SpaceNews.\n\nChristensen says these firms likely will be targeting providing launch services for the many private aerospace constellations under development in China, such as those by GalaxySpace, Changguang Satellite\u2019s Jilin-1 constellation, Guodian Gaoke, MinoSpace and more.\n\n\u201cIf the planned launch tempo for 2023 is successful it might represent the opening of capability that would provide momentum to deployment of Chinese small satellite constellations.\u201d\n\nThis would however have some international repercussions, such as in the realm of space traffic management.\n\n\u201cIt would represent an increase in operators and satellites in a LEO environment which is already becoming more complex, and would thus place greater emphasis on the need for both sharing of space safety data and for satellite operator coordination channels between the U.S. and China,\u201d says Christensen.\n\nThe emergence of Chinese commercial space companies began in late 2014 when the country opened portions of the space sector to private capital, largely in response to the developments observed in the United States, exemplified by companies such as SpaceX and Planet.\n\nThis move has spurred the creation of hundreds of space-related companies engaged in a range of activities, including launch, satellite operation and manufacture, ground stations, downstream applications, and more.\n\nThe Chinese government has since enacted further measures to foster its commercial space sector, including policy support and guidance and a military-civil fusion national strategy which allows technologies to move between approved entities.",
