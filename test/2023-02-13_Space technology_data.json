Credit: Gints Ivuskans / Shutterstock.com.\n\nAmbitions to operate a highly capable national defence industrial base are not unique to Turkey, in fact, many states see this as a method of obtaining security through independence. Turkey has committed to this goal more than most by stating its desire to achieve domestic involvement in 75% of all defence procurement programs by 2023. This target was set prior to the invasion of Ukraine and before the current high levels of inflation \u2013 both of which would be key drivers for wanting higher levels of domestic production for reasons which will be outlined below. Instead, the figure was outlined in the 2019-2023 Strategic Plan, just after the Lira\u2019s value collapsed against the US Dollar. Official figures are yet to be released and so it remains unclear whether Turkey has met the 75% goal, however, the progress Turkey has made in the development of its industry is already having a notable impact. The journey to this target, current successes resulting from the plan, and future impacts are examined below.\n\nThere are several reasons why Turkey has set out to strengthen its indigenous defence production capabilities. Politically, the invasion of Ukraine has provided a valuable opportunity that Turkey could take advantage of. The rift between Russia and Nato has created a potentially highly lucrative gap in the market for Turkey. Russia is unlikely to be able to fulfil or complete its ongoing foreign defence contracts: countries that had placed orders with Russia may look to a country such as Turkey to fulfil their requirements. A strong defence industry that is producing capable platforms and systems could leverage huge economic opportunities for Turkey. The value of this is compounded by the poor economic scenario in Turkey. Soaring inflation, the poor performance of the Lira against the US Dollar (and the resultant lack of purchasing power), and high levels of government debt have left Turkey in need of a financial boost. In 2022, Turkish defence exports were valued at more than $4bn, up from $3.1bn in 2021. The growth of this revenue stream shows why Turkey is so determined to realise its domestic defence production goals.\n\nBy fostering a healthy domestic industrial environment Turkey is developing successful platforms that are attracting foreign buyers. Examples of note include the TB2 Bayraktar, manufactured by the Turkish firm Baykar which has been lauded as a success after its use in Ukraine. Baykar is now developing a new air-to-air combat drone, the Kizilelma. Turkey\u2019s offerings to the UAV market are emerging as challengers to the existing players in the market.\n\nBeyond the economic opportunities created by having a strong export offering, a developed defence industry may have deeper impacts on Turkey. National elections are being held in June 2023, with the country voting on who will hold Presidential office. Concerns around corruption are raising questions over how legitimate any result will be, however, President Erdogan will still be looking for areas of potential leverage in his re-election campaign. A strong domestic defence industry, that has developed at pace over recent years, is a valuable asset for the current government, due to its economic and political power.\n\nOver the 2019-2023 period, Turkey has had significant success in its goals to achieve domestic involvement in 75% of all defence procurement programs by this year. Given the positive impact of this endeavour, it is likely that any future Presidential administration will continue to invest in and champion the indigenous defence industry.",

            "text": "Enabling & Support Forecasting Solar Storms with the Solar Energetic Particle Advanced Warning System 13/02/2023 187 views 1 likes\n\nThe energetic and explosive ejection of plasma from the Sun can cause intense radiation storms. Sudden, large-scale changes in the Sun\u2019s local magnetic field topology and ultimate re-configuration (known as magnetic reconnection) results in eruptions in the form of solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). These large-scale solar phenomena events emit vast quantities of electromagnetic radiation and highly energetic particles into space. This can create havoc in the near-Earth environment, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences for orbiting satellites, interplanetary spacecraft, and human spaceflight activities.\n\nForecasting and nowcasting concept of the ASPECS solar radiation storm forecasting system The Advanced Solar Particle Events Casting System (ASPECS) is a modular software tool designed to improve the prediction of solar radiation storms. ASPECS operates on a three-tier system, combining a historical database of radiation storms and their driving solar phenomena, with real-time remote sensing and in-situ observations. The system includes: Tier One: Forecasting Solar Flares - A solar magnetogram of the Sun\u2019s disk is used to predict the probability of a solar flare. A higher chance of flaring is implied when observations of the Sun\u2019s active regions, which may be seen through sunspots in the visible part of the spectrum, indicate increasing size, complexity and intensity of the surrounding magnetic field. The outputs are probabilistic, given as a function of flare size and the peak- X-ray intensity given in watts-per-square metre (between one and eight Angstrom). Flaring is forecast with horizons varying between 6 hours and 3 days.\n\nSOHO captures coronal mass ejection blasting from the Sun's far side in the direction of Venus Tier Two: Forecasting with the Onset of Solar Energetic Particles - The probability of a radiation storm is predicted by directly combining the output of the solar flare forecast from tier one with the historical observations for similar solar longitudes. This informs users about the magnetic connectivity of the active region to the near-Earth environment \u2013 a novel connection for this development. Alternatively, after the occurrence of a solar eruption, a short-term forecast (or nowcast) is derived from the characteristics of the solar flare (size & location) and/or related CME (width & speed), giving the probability of a large radiation storm forming at different energy levels. Outputs are given at the 90 % and 50 % confidence levels. Tier Three: Forecasting the Characteristics of Solar Energic Particles - A time profile of the solar particle event is initially derived by matching the current event to the most appropriate output from a database of profiles by a physics-based simulations, re-scaling as necessary. The time series can later switch to an analytical fit of the event as it is occurring if no simulation reflects what is being observed. Much like terrestrial weather forecasting, the system evolves as the radiation storm develops, providing a near real-time profile of the solar particle event at different energy levels.\n\nASPECS is free to access via a simple web-based graphical user interface. Users access a reliable, near real-time prediction of possible solar events, or an a posteriori simulation of an historic even where the only required input is a date. The modular approach to forecasting enables the easy incorporation of new, scientific developments - avoiding unnecessary duplication and the unnecessary redesigning of the system in the future.

The public pool was for white people only, so he could not learn to swim. When he was nine years old, a librarian called the police on him for trying to borrow calculus books.\n\nMcNair fought the racism and went on to study physics at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro \u2014 a historically Black institution \u2014 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. In 1978, NASA chose him as a finalist to be an astronaut, in the first such group to contain women, people of colour and scientists. His pioneering class included Sally Ride, who would become the first US woman in space; Ellison Onizuka, the first Asian American in space; and Guion Bluford, the first African American in space.\n\nFifty years after astronauts left the Moon, they are going back. Why?\n\nWith The New Guys, Meredith Bagby, a film producer and former journalist, has produced a broad and easily readable narrative about this group of US astronauts. She does not break new ground in outlining their experiences and the team\u2019s role in space history. But she does illuminate the historic nature of their selection \u2014 and, significantly, how they helped to shape NASA\u2019s space shuttle programme, from its first flight in 1981 until its end in 2011.\n\nNASA\u2019s first astronaut class, chosen in 1959, was the iconic Mercury Seven that included John Glenn, Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom. The next six groups were in the same vein: all white, male military pilots lionized for having \u201cthe right stuff\u201d. Then came the class of 1978. Of the 35 new astronauts, 14 were civilians, 6 were women and 4 were men of colour.\n\nIt was a time of huge change for NASA. The Apollo Moon programme had wound down, and NASA had set its sights on developing a reusable space plane that would launch like a rocket and land like an aeroplane. Astronauts on this vehicle would deploy military and scientific satellites into space. It was time for a new type of astronaut for a new type of spaceship.\n\nBreaking through prejudice\n\nBagby views the shuttle era through the experiences of its astronauts, with a focus on women moving into new roles. They include Ride, a gay woman who remained in the closet while at NASA because the agency would not hire her otherwise; geologist Kathryn Sullivan; physicians Rhea Seddon and Anna Fisher; biochemist Shannon Lucid; and engineer Judith Resnik.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the view in much of NASA\u2019s ranks was that the agency had lowered its standards to admit a more diverse class, and the class acquired the soubriquet \u201cThose Fucking New Guys\u201d. John Glenn and Chuck Yeager, the quintessential \u201cright stuff\u201d pilots, were among those who fought against hiring women as astronauts. Opposition from Yeager had probably helped to keep Ed Dwight, a Black test pilot, from joining a previous class.\n\nSally Ride, the first US woman in space, works on the flight deck of the space shuttle Challenger in 1983.Credit: NASA\n\nBagby\u2019s narrative shines as she explores the early years of the space shuttle as NASA focused on deploying large satellites. In 1990, for instance, Sullivan helped to launch the Hubble Space Telescope, an observatory too large to get into orbit on any other vehicle.\n\nIt is easy to forget that shuttle astronauts performed the first on-orbit satellite repair back in 1984, on the Solar Maximum Mission observatory, and deployed important scientific spacecraft such as the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Ulysses mission to study the Sun. But the pressure to fly as often as possible to meet the needs of customers quickly caught up with NASA. From 1983 onwards, cost-cutting meant fewer engineers, fewer inspections and less time and attention to spend on thorny mechanical issues.\n\nOn separate flights in January 1985 and April 1985, Onizuka and fellow class member Frederick Gregory came close to death without knowing it, when the O-rings that helped to seal the shuttle\u2019s solid rocket boosters nearly failed. Facing a long list of planned launches, NASA managers overrode concerns aired by contractors. In January 1986, four members of the group \u2014 McNair, Onizuka, Resnik and Richard Scobee \u2014 were on board with three other astronauts when the space shuttle Challenger\u2019s O-rings failed just after lift-off, causing an explosion that killed them all.\n\nThe $93-billion plan to put astronauts back on the Moon\n\nRide served on the panel that investigated those deaths, and helped to bring the O-ring cover-up to public light. The disaster led to the end of the shuttle\u2019s role in deploying satellites and in partnering with the military.\n\nAnd yet Ride found herself on an investigation panel again in 2003 \u2014 this time concerning the fatal accident of the shuttle Columbia, which disintegrated just before landing because a piece of foam that had detached from the fuel tank during launch had damaged the craft\u2019s thermal-protection tiles. As with Challenger, NASA culture was to blame. Mission control did not even inform the Columbia crew about the foam strike until a week into the nearly 16-day mission, when it said: \u201cThis item is not even worth mentioning other than wanting to make sure that you are not surprised by it in a question from a reporter.\u201d\n\nNASA retired the shuttle fleet in 2011, after astronauts finished construction on the International Space Station \u2014 an abrupt ending to the programme and to the story of the 1978 astronaut class.\n\nMuch of the information in The New Guys can be found elsewhere. David Shayler and Colin Burgess\u2019s 2020 book NASA\u2019s First Space Shuttle Astronaut Selection contains more technical detail on the class of 1978. Sociologist Diane Vaughan\u2019s The Challenger Launch Decision (1996) is the definitive account of the circumstances of that disaster. The many popular histories of the shuttle programme include journalist Pat Duggins\u2019s 2007 book Final Countdown. But The New Guys succeeds as a comprehensive and engaging overview of this period in space-exploration history.\n\nToday, NASA\u2019s astronaut corps is much more diverse; last year, the European Space Agency even announced the world\u2019s first physically disabled astronaut candidate, former paralympic athlete John McFall. And for that, we can all thank the Fucking New Guys.",

            "text": "Ibadan, 13 February 2023. \u2013 Germany-based wildfire solution company OroraTech has announced its new on-orbit fire processing technology that can detect and send fire notification alarms to customers via the multi-satellite link within three minutes once the satellite has passed the affected area. As a result, the technology will cut fire detection from one and a half hours, resulting in a faster detection time.\n\nAccording to the Company, the challenge today is that most wildfires happen in the afternoon, and it often takes up to one and a half hours for a publicly available satellite to detect the fire. The main delay with most satellites originates in the need for a satellite to pass over a ground station to download the data. However, OroraTech has overcome this problem by compressing the fire information and sending it down to Earth via an inter-satellite link, avoiding the need to overpass a ground station.\n\nThomas Gr\u00fcbler, CEO of OroraTech, speaking on the technology, stated, \u201cdeveloping solutions based on our customers\u2019 key problems have led to this technological breakthrough. This opportunity is especially interesting for industries where real-time data is crucial. This includes wildlife conservation, commercial forestry, agriculture, insurance, food security, or critical infrastructure monitoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will provide on-orbit detection at an unprecedented speed to our clients with the unique satellite constellation launched in 2024 and ready to be booked by our clients.

            "text": "Elestor\u2019s innovative hydrogen bromine flow battery technology offers a reliable and low-cost energy storage solution.\n\nIf anything separates people active in the world of energy storage, it is hydrogen. \u2018Ideal\u2019 and \u2018necessary\u2019 are heard just as often as \u2018too expensive\u2019 and \u2018inefficient\u2019. Be that as it may, at present hydrogen can hardly compete with batteries. At the same time, everyone can see that this is partly caused by the immaturity of the market and a lack of application possibilities. Still, hydrogen is expected to play an important role in the new energy system.\n\nThe Dutch-based company Elestor can remove an important barrier to the development of hydrogen as an energy carrier. With the integration of it\u2019s award winning hydrogen bromine flow battery technology, it demonstrates that electrolysers, needed to produce hydrogen, can be used continuously, for long periods of time, and with cheap renewable electricity.\n\nThe economics of electrolysis\n\nThe hydrogen production costs from electrolysis are determined by the capital costs of the electrolyser, its utilisation, and the (average) electricity price during the time of operation. High electrolyser utilisation reduces the share of the electrolyser depreciation in hydrogen production costs. On the other hand, a higher utilisation increases electricity costs, as hours of expensive electricity will increasingly be included. Hence, in order to minimise hydrogen production costs, electrolyser utilisation has to be balanced with the electricity price.1\n\nThe key to reducing the cost of hydrogen production is to enhance electrolyser utilisation. This utilisation is, however, determined by the relatively short periods of time during which renewable electricity is cheap enough to economically justify producing hydrogen at a moderate energetic efficiency. In addition, an intermittent operation of electrolysers results in disproportional high costs for maintenance.\n\nThe goal is, therefore, to introduce a solution, allowing electrolysers to run continuously for long periods of time and with low-cost renewable electricity.\n\nAn obvious way to realise this would be to connect a battery parallel to the electrolyser. The battery stores cheap electricity to be used again by the electrolyser during periods in which the electricity from the grid is too expensive. This then increases the utilisation of the electrolyser with low-cost renewable electricity.\n\nPurely from a conceptual point of view, any battery could, in principle, do the job. However, to also realise an economically viable solution, it is essential that the storage costs per MWh, also known as Levelized Cost of Storage (LCoS), of the battery are extremely low.\n\nThe economic breakthrough lies in using cheap energy that you get from a battery at times when energy from the normal grid is expensive. In principle, this could be done with any battery, but of course you want one whose storage cost per MWh is extremely low by nature. And that is exactly the case with the hydrogen-bromine flow battery: no other battery can store energy at lower costs per MWh.\n\nAnd there is another advantage. As a direct result of the operating principle, using hydrogen as a storage medium, this technology has a special match with the production of hydrogen by electrolysis.\n\nHow does HBr flow battery technology work?\n\nElestor has introduced a storage technology for stationary, large-scale applications, which makes use of the flow battery principle. The diagram below shows the basic concept.\n\nThe battery consists of two large tanks to store the active materials. The red tank on the left side stores an aqueous HBr/Br 2 solution, and the blue tank on the right stores hydrogen gas (H 2 ). Bromine is, with astronomic global reserves of 100 trillion tons, abundantly available and extracted from seawater. Its availability is not geographically limited to certain regions, and therefore available at very low cost \u2013 not only today, but forever.\n\nEach tank is part of an individual closed circuit through which the active materials flow (hence the name \u2018flow battery\u2019). The active materials flowing through the two circuits interact with each other through a membrane, which is a special layer allowing only hydrogen ions (H+) to pass through during charge or discharge.\n\nThe system is completely closed and works as any normal battery, with + and \u2013 poles for DC power connection to charge and discharge. And, like with any normal battery, nothing goes in or out \u2013 except electricity.\n\nThe required low storage cost per MWh is achieved with Elestor\u2019s patented hydrogen bromine (HBr) flow battery technology. In addition, and due to its unique working principle using hydrogen as a storage medium, the HBr technology has a unique fit with hydrogen production through electrolysis.\n\nIn summary, the HBr flow battery:\n\nGenerates hydrogen while charging, which is temporarily stored;\n\nUses the same hydrogen again during the discharging process; and\n\nDoes \u2013 roundtrip \u2013 not produce, nor consume, hydrogen.\n\nThe best of two worlds: A unique and cost-effective integration\n\nCombining the best of two worlds by integrating the HBr flow battery with electrolysis results in:\n\nIn this combination:\n\nThe electrolyser produces hydrogen whenever\n\nrenewable electricity is low-cost, due to temporary overproduction;\n\nrenewable electricity is low-cost, due to temporary overproduction; Simultaneously, the flow battery stores the same low-cost electricity, against the lowest possible storage costs per MWh;\n\nOnce the price of renewable electricity increases, the electrolyser uses the in the flow battery stored electricity to generate hydrogen; and\n\nOnce the electricity price drops again, the procedure is repeated.\n\nConsequently:\n\nThe flow battery bridges the periods, during which renewable electricity from the grid is expensive, with the stored low-cost electricity; and\n\nThe electrolyser utilisation is maximised.\n\nWhen taking a second look at the above figure, it becomes clear that both the flow battery and the electrolyser include a tank to store hydrogen. Obviously, it makes sense to combine these into one single hydrogen storage tank:\n\nThe use of hydrogen for its charge and discharge processes forms the key for Elestor\u2019s flow battery to realise a unique and extremely cost-effective integration with electrolysers. In this way, both worlds of energy storage \u2013 with batteries and in the form of hydrogen \u2013 are integrated, which, in addition, introduces new optimisation strategies on an overall energy system level.\n\nAbove configuration leads to a number of advantages, including:\n\nIntegration of electricity storage and hydrogen production;\n\nMaximise electrolyser utilisation while making use of low-cost electricity;\n\nContinuous hydrogen production;\n\nImproved electrolyser business case, reduced hydrogen production costs;\n\nReduction of flow battery CapEx; and\n\nFurther reduction of storage costs per MWh (LCoS).\n\nElectricity storage integrated in hydrogen infrastructures\n\nThe above applied principle unlocks other interesting and unique concepts. Apart from local storage of electricity with batteries, hydrogen is expected to play an increasingly important role in the energy transition. Hydrogen can be cost-effectively transported over long distances through pipeline infrastructures, which are constructed during the next decades on nationwide scales.\n\nThese national hydrogen backbones form a unique opportunity for Elestor\u2019s flow battery to serve as a large storage tank for hydrogen. Since the HBr flow battery produces hydrogen during charge and uses exactly the same amount of hydrogen again during discharge, the net supply to, and consumption from, the hydrogen infrastructure is zero. Therefore, tapping into a hydrogen infrastructure does not change anything for the infrastructure itself, but it facilitates the connection of very large electricity storage systems.\n\nThe connection of Elestor\u2019s flow battery to hydrogen backbones leads to a number of advantages, including:\n\nReduction of flow battery CapEx;\n\nReduction of space requirements; and\n\nFurther reduction of storage costs per MWh (LCoS).\n\nReferences\n\nPlease note, this article will also appear in the thirteenth edition of our quarterly publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to this partner's profile page to learn more about them\n\n",

            "text": "In 2019, years before a hulking high-altitude Chinese balloon floated across the United States and caused widespread alarm, one of China\u2019s top aeronautics scientists made a proud announcement that received little attention back then: His team had launched an airship more than 60,000 feet into the air and sent it sailing around most of the globe, including across North America.\n\nThe scientist, Wu Zhe, told a state-run news outlet at the time that the \u201cCloud Chaser\u201d airship was a milestone in his vision of populating the upper reaches of the earth\u2019s atmosphere with steerable balloons that could be used to provide early warnings of natural disasters, monitor pollution or carry out airborne surveillance.\n\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s America,\u201d Professor Wu said in an accompanying video, pointing on a computer screen to a red line that appeared to trace the airship\u2019s path across Asia, northern Africa, and near the southern edge of the United States. By the time of the report, it was over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nProfessor Wu\u2019s announcement is part of a body of evidence revealing in new detail the scope of the Chinese government\u2019s ambitions to use high-altitude airships to track earthbound activities, with an eye on both domestic and military needs.

In addition, the Saudi Human Spaceflight Program includes the training of two more astronauts Mariam Fardous and Ali Al-Ghamdi on all mission requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Saudi Space Commission Eng. Abdullah Al-Swaha clarified Sunday that the Kingdom\u2019s leadership is keen to give unlimited support to the space program.\n\n\n\nThrough this program, the Kingdom seeks to activate scientific innovations at the level of space sciences, enhance its ability to independently conduct its own research that will reflect positively on the future of the industry and the country, increase the interest of graduates in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and develop human capital by attracting talents and the necessary skills.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Mohammed Al-Tamimi, the CEO of the Saudi Space Commission, expressed his gratitude to the leadership for the support and empowerment to the commission, which has diminished the obstacles and challenges and enabled major leaps of the Kingdom into the space sector.\n\n\n\nHuman spaceflight is a symbol of countries\u2019 superiority and global competitiveness in many fields such as technology, engineering, research, and innovation. This mission is also historic, as it will make the Kingdom one of the few countries in the world that brings two astronauts of the same nationality aboard the International Space Station simultaneously.\n\n\n\nThe Saudi Space Commission also stated that this program comes in cooperation with a group of entities, led by the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Sport, the General Authority of Civil Aviation and King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, in addition to international partners such as Axiom Space, which specializes in human spaceflights and the development of space infrastructure in the USA.\n\n\n\nIt is also to be noted that the Saudi Space Commission had previously launched the Saudi Human Spaceflight Program. This flight is an integral milestone of a comprehensive program aiming to train and qualify experienced Saudis to undertake human spaceflight, conduct scientific experiments, participate in international research, and future space-related missions contributing to the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2022 The Saudi Gazette.

The aim is to acquire technologies and build infrastructure to improve, for example, the management of water, marine and terrestrial natural resources, agriculture and the environment.\n\nPHOTO/House of HM the King - During the recent visit of the King and Queen of Spain to Angola, neither the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, nor the Secretary of State for Trade, Xiana M\u00e9ndez, discussed bilateral space cooperation\n\nAngola, another missed opportunity\n\nNearly fifty satellites of all kinds orbit the Earth under the flags of African countries. The most recent is the 1.9-tonne Angosat-2, a voice, TV and internet communications satellite owned by the government of Angolan President Joao Manuel Gon\u00e7alves Louren\u00e7o. Manufactured in Russia by the Reshetnev company, it was launched into space on 12 October on a Proton rocket from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome. It is the country's first, as AngoSat-1 was lost in December 2017 shortly after its separation from the Zenit-3F rocket.\n\nThe King and Queen of Spain have just returned from a three-day state visit to Angola. In the entourage were the Foreign Minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, and the Secretary of State for Trade, Xiana M\u00e9ndez. But there was no agenda for bilateral space cooperation, despite the fact that the former Portuguese colony has an organisation for this purpose - the National Space Programme Management Office - and the creation of the Spanish Space Agency is imminent. The same thing happened during the visit of President Pedro S\u00e1nchez to Kenya and South Africa in October, both nations with space agencies.\n\nThe AfSA did not emerge overnight, but has been in the making for more than a decade. AU officials have been in talks for many years with European Space Agency (ESA) managers and technicians to learn about the particularities, structure and functioning of an agency created in 1975 and which does not belong to the European Union.\n\nPHOTO/Roscosmos - Angola's president has a keen interest in the benefits of space. Angosat-1, his first satellite, failed. The second, Angosat-2, is already in orbit for voice, TV and Internet communications\n\nThey also met with executives of the latest European Union Space Programme Agency (EUSPA), established by Brussels in April 2021. Headed by Portugal's Rodrigo da Costa, EUSPA is responsible for Europe's satellite navigation programme (Galileo), Earth observation (Copernicus) and government satellite communications (Govsatcom), among others.\n\nAs a result of the lessons learned from these contacts, AfSA has similarities and differences with ESA and EUSPA, but in a very different geographical, socio-economic and political environment. China has also played an important role in the founding of the new space actor, given the Asian giant's influence over African countries with agencies, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Sudan.\n\nPHOTO/EU - Since 2018, the African Union has had access to data from the Sentinel observation satellites of the European Union's Copernicus constellation. In the picture, Mahama Ouedraogo and Philippe Brunet representing the two institutions\n\nConsumers of space technologies\n\nAfSA's raison d'\u00eatre is \"to promote and coordinate the implementation of African space policy and strategy, as well as to carry out activities to exploit space technologies and applications for sustainable development and the improvement of the well-being of African citizens\", emphasises article 4 of its statutes.\n\nThe new agency's role is not to develop satellites, spacecraft, let alone space launchers, initiatives that are at the core of ESA. AfSA has been created to boost the sector in Africa, while also acting as a monitor of progress, both at national and continental level, in line with the African Space Strategy adopted in 2016.\n\nPHOTO/ESA - Most African nations consume satellite communications, meteorology, observation and navigation technologies. But only a few have their own satellites, such as Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa\n\nAmong the objectives is the interest in \"strengthening space missions on the continent to ensure optimal access to space data, information, services and products\". It should be noted that, in practice, all African nations are consumers of products derived from satellite communications, meteorology, observation and navigation technologies. Only a few are major players and have satellites of their own: Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa, joined in recent years by Angola and Kenya.\n\nWith the aim of \"fostering cooperation and avoiding duplication of efforts\", article 5 of the AfSA assigns it the role of \"promoting strategic intercontinental partnerships, fostering regional coordination and collaboration, and engaging member states in space-related activities and research in Africa\".\n\nPHOTO/African Union - China's penetration of all sectors in Africa is evident. Foreign Minister Qin Gang inaugurated in January the new headquarters of the AU's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which uses Beijing satellites\n\nThe responsibilities assigned to the Agency also include coordinating the development of a \"critical mass of African capabilities in space science, technology and innovation through education and training programmes\". It is an extension of the African Space Strategy, which aims to \"attract students to postgraduate programmes focused on achieving an indigenous space sector in the changing socio-economic landscape\".\n\nAfSA also aims to be the implementing hand for the African Union's self-imposed 2019 space strategy. It is part of the Agenda 2063 adopted by the AU Assembly to make the black continent a \"global power of the future\". This is what the heads of state and government of the 55 countries proclaim, and they want the African Space Agency to be one of the major tools to achieve this. The steps on paper have been taken, but all are aware that it will not be easy.",

A reactor was then developed to perform molten regolith electrolysis and produce iron, silicon, and aluminum, with oxygen as a byproduct that can be used for propulsion and life support.\n\n(Credit: Blue Origin)\n\nThe reactor operates at temperatures above 1,600 degrees Celsius, and the silicon produced is then purified to more than 99.999% using only sunlight. Molten regolith electrolysis byproducts are used to create cover glass to protect the solar cells for at least a decade, and the aluminum is used as wire.\n\nBlue Alchemist is impressive for two reasons: Not only does it pave the way for easy and abundant access to electrical power on the Moon, the technology requires no water, no toxic chemicals or ingredients, and produces no carbon emissions while manufacturing the panels. It therefore has the potential to be used on Earth as an eco-friendly alternative to current solar panel manufacturing processes.",

The craft is set to be undocked from the station and deorbit to burn in the atmosphere Feb. 18.\n\nThe announcement came shortly after a new Russian cargo ship docked smoothly at the station Saturday. The Progress MS-22 delivered almost 3 tons of food, water and fuel along with scientific equipment for the crew.\n\nRoscosmos said that the loss of pressure in the Progress MS-21 didn\u2019t affect the docking of the new cargo ship and \u201cwill have no impact on the future station program.\u201d\n\nThe depressurization of the cargo craft follows an incident in December with the Soyuz crew capsule, which was hit by a tiny meteoroid that left a small hole in the exterior radiator and sent coolant spewing into space.\n\nRussian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to use the capsule to return to Earth in March, but Russian space officials decided that higher temperatures resulting from the coolant leak could make it dangerous to use.\n\nThey decided to launch a new Soyuz capsule February 20 so the crew would have a lifeboat in the event of an emergency. But since it will travel in automatic mode to expedite the launch, a replacement crew will now have to wait until late summer or fall when another capsule is ready. It means that Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio will have to stay several extra months at the station, possibly pushing their mission to close to a year.\n\nNASA took part in all the discussions and agreed with the plan.\n\nBesides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada, Russian Anna Kikina, and Japan\u2019s Koichi Wakata.

            "text": "After the tech boom women still remain second class citizens\n\nWhispers resound that Silicon Valley is sliding back into \u2018Bro Culture\u2019 \u2013 that is, of course, if you believe that the tech industry ever actually rid itself of bro culture in the first place. And, despite women outperforming men in coding, interpersonal, and leadership skills, surging firings by technology companies late last year disproportionately affected women and mid-career talent.\n\nThe scale of this cultural crisis runs deep, as laid barren by McKinsey\u2019s recent report on Women in the Workplace. According to their analysis, women leaders are leaving their companies at the highest rate in years, and the gap between women and men leaders leaving is the largest we\u2019ve ever seen. The scale of the problem is so dire that, for every one woman at the director level who gets promoted to the next level, two women directors are choosing to leave their company. The old \u201cboys club\u201d of the tech industry is still well in place.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nFor starters, at least, the general public is much more aware of these imbalances than they were five years ago. And some progress has been made through industry pledges to add women to senior leadership positions at venture capital firms and newer technology companies. But there\u2019s still a long way to go. Even after the latest technology boom, gender equality was supposed to be a reality in 2022. Sadly, it\u2019s not. Twenty-five percent of board seats are held by women, up from 17.4% in 2018 and currently, women represent only 25% of computing-related jobs. (Source: Deloitte Insights Report). It may seem negligible, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction!\n\nWhile women have made great strides in tech careers, there\u2019s still a long way to go to achieve equity. At Women Impact Tech, we\u2019re changing the way women are viewed in the tech industry and the tech space as a whole by promoting equity in the tech space.\n\nThough it\u2019s a societal issue at large, women in tech don\u2019t have to feel helpless: with the right tools and guidance, women are capable of rising above. Here are the top six tips for women in tech roles to navigate for their career advancement and success (or any male-dominated field):\n\nSpeak up . Women tend to be much more quiet and passive than men, who tend to be assertive. Ask your employer for equity, ask for a seat at the table where major decisions are being made; confidence is key. Take a personal inventory . Take stock of your career and experience, as well as your passions and motivations. Don\u2019t let yourself burn out \u2013 53% of working moms get less than 6 hours of sleep per night, and almost a quarter of working moms have no time for self-care, including healthy eating, exercise, or connecting with friends. Find community . The most important thing to remember on your tech journey is that you aren\u2019t alone. There are other junior, mid-career, and senior-level women in tech facing the same challenges and navigating the same terrain.

Too often, women take the first offer and don\u2019t negotiate raises.

            "text": "Drone startup Garuda Aerospace on Monday said it has raised $22 million in an early stage funding round led by venture capital firm SphitiCap The Series A funding round provides Garuda Aerospace a $250-million valuation, its founder and CEO Agnishwar Jayaprakash told ET in an interaction.SphitiCap invested $12 million in the round. Other investors included Canada-based Ocgrow Ventures, the United Kingdom-based Silverstone Capital , an undisclosed infra development company, high net-worth individuals (HNI) and angel investors, Jayaprakash said.\"Garuda Aerospace aims to sell 25,000 drones in the next 18 months and is looking forward to exporting 10,000 drones to about 100 countries in the next 15 months,\u201d he said.The company had last raised funding of about $1 million in 2021.Founded in 2015, Garuda Aerospace manufactures and sells drones (55% of revenues) and also offers \u2018drone-as-a-service\u2019 (45%). Besides India, it currently does business in Malaysia, Singapore, the United States, Panama, and the United Arab Emirates, Jayaprakash said.He said the company will be closing the financial year ending March 2023 with Rs 40 crore in revenues \u2013 a number he pegs will reach Rs 800-1,000 crore by FY24.Garuda Aerospace will use the new capital to scale up and expand its operations, while also accelerating its development of building advanced drone solutions for the armed forces and the aerospace sector in collaboration with global companies.The funds will also be used for the skilling and training of drone pilots and help create employment with deepening its footprints in Tier II and III cities. Beyond catering its sales and services in industries of agriculture, defense and industrial plants, Garuda Aerospace also pulls revenue out of a new segment of drone pilot training courses.It manufactures 30 types of drones and offers 50 types of services and claims to have served over 750 clients including Tata, Godrej, Adani, Reliance Swiggy , Flipkart, Delhivery, L&T, Survey of India, Lockheed Martin, Cognizant, and Elbit Systems.The firm currently operates over 400 drones with about 500 pilots in 84 cities.Late-stage and growth-stage technology institutional venture capital investors have largely stayed away from drone startups. Founders told ET that these funds are taking time to evaluate the business. Startups hence end up choosing strategic investors that then present themselves with go-to-market opportunities across the globe.Another funded player in the space is Qualcomm Ventures and Infosys-backed ideaForge, which develops and manufactures drones meant for the Indian Army\u2019s surveillance capabilities among other use cases and clients. The Mumbai-based company is set to raise about Rs 750 crore ($90.89 million) through an initial public offer (IPO) \u2013 valuing itself at Rs 3,000 crore (about $363.55 million) \u2013 as ET reported on Friday",
