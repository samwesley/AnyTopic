            "text": "Former US Air Force major Even \u201cJolly\u201d Rogers is worried about a space war. \u201cConflict exists on a continuum that begins with competition and ultimately leads into full-scale conflict like what you\u2019re seeing in Ukraine,\u201d he says. The US, he adds, is already \u201cin active competition with Russia and China for freedom of action and dominance of the space domain. And it\u2019s evolving very quickly.\u201d\n\nSo on January 26 last year, the former US Air Force major incorporated True Anomaly, Inc to \u201csolve the most challenging orbital warfare problems for the US Space Force,\u201d he later tweeted.\n\nAccording to a recent filing with the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC), True Anomaly is now gearing up for its first orbital mission. In October, True Anomaly hopes to launch two Jackal \u201corbital pursuit\u201d spacecraft aboard a SpaceX rocket to low earth orbit. The Jackals will not house guns, warheads, or laser blasters, but they will be capable of rendezvous proximity operations (RPO)\u2014the ability to maneuver close to other satellites and train a battery of sensors upon them. This could reveal their rivals\u2019 surveillance and weapons systems or help intercept communications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their first mission, dubbed Demo-1, the Jackals will merely spy on each other, using thrusters, radar, and multi-spectral cameras to approach within a few hundred meters. If that goes well, Rogers envisages deploying thousands of autonomous spacecraft in service of the US military, controlled by a team of human operators and AI \u201cto pursue adversaries wherever they fly, and to provide the tools of accountability.\u201d\n\nThose tools start with understanding what technologies America\u2019s adversaries are deploying in space. \u201cBut an active defense is going to be required,\u201d says Rogers, now True Anomaly\u2019s CEO. \u201cIf you take the job of defense and protection of the domain seriously, you have to have the ability to do the joint functions of maneuver and fires.\u201d Although the military often uses \u201cfires\u201d to mean kinetic weapons like guns and shells, in the space context, it usually refers to jamming, electronic warfare, and cyberattacks.\n\nNothing on True Anomaly\u2019s website suggests that it is developing its own offensive weapons. However, in a series of posts last summer, Rogers tweeted: \u201cTactically disabling enemy spacecraft can be the difference between the loss of an entire Carrier Strike Group or its survival... And there are many ways to destroy spacecraft that don\u2019t ruin the environment. After all, they are just floating computers.\u201d",

            "text": "SPACE FLIGHT Nuclear rocket eyed for Mars trips NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) plan to launch and test a nuclear-powered rocket engine in space as soon as 2027, the agencies announced last week. Such engines promise higher thrust and efficiency than conventional ones, enabling faster travel times and bigger payloads for human missions to Mars, the agencies say. Although NASA has experimented with nuclear engines since the 1960s, none has been demonstrated in space. Powered by low-enriched uranium, the engine\u2019s fission reactor will heat and vaporize liquid propellants, shooting the gases out of a nozzle to provide thrust. NASA will provide the engine and DARPA the experimental spacecraft that will carry it. The design plans include a safety review.\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES Pandemic declaration extended Three years after it started, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this week. But a special emergency committee for the disease hinted that the designation\u2014which gives WHO recommendations more heft and can influence travel and quarantine policies\u2014might end later this year. Since WHO first declared COVID-19 a PHEIC on 30 January 2020, the panel has recommended 11 times to keep the designation in place. Although COVID-19 is causing fewer deaths now than 1 year ago, it \u201cremains a dangerous infectious disease,\u201d the panel said, with more than 170,000 COVID-19\u2013related deaths reported within the past 8 weeks, about 80,000 of them in China. The committee encouraged WHO to integrate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance into monitoring of influenza viruses. It asked the agency to assess how ending the PHEIC would affect the development and authorization of COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Separately, the administration of President Joe Biden said this week it will end the U.S. declaration of a national public health emergency in May . That policy has, for example, paid for COVID-19 testing and treatment for people lacking health insurance.\n\nWORKPLACE Scientists\u2019 job joy stays strong Job satisfaction in 2021 among U.S. scientists and engineers holding Ph.D.s matched the high levels recorded prepandemic, according to survey findings reported last week by the U.S. National Science Foundation. Across academe, government, and industry, between 89% and 95% of respondents said they were very or somewhat satisfied with their principal job, about the same levels as in 2019. Employment also stayed high, at about 85%. In 2021, 3% reported that COVID-19 influenced them to work only part time or not at all, for example because of pandemic-related family responsibilities, reduced hours, or layoffs, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients found.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH Reports of Long Covid wane Long Covid\u2019s prevalence among Americans who\u2019ve had the virus is declining, a survey indicates. The new data come from the Household Pulse Survey, run by the U.S. Census Bureau; during the pandemic, it has added questions about COVID-19. The most recent results, analyzed last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, showed that in June 2022, 19% of people who reported having had a bout of COVID-19 said they had Long Covid when they took the survey. By January, that number had dropped to 11%. The decline suggests at least some people are recovering from the chronic, disabling symptoms, such as fatigue and breathlessness, associated with Long Covid. It also suggests the risk of developing Long Covid may have dropped over time. Still, the U.S. prevalence is about 6%, as researchers study how to treat it.\n\nANIMAL BEHAVIOR Dolphins boost fishers\u2019 haul Fishers and dolphins work together to catch mullet at Praia da Tesoura in Laguna, Brazil. F\u00c1BIO DAURA-JORGE/FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF SANTA CATARINA For more than a century, artisanal fishers in southern Brazil have worked alongside wild bottlenose dolphins in an unusual example of cooperative hunting. The dolphins chase a 40-centimeter-long fish called the Lebranche mullet (Mugil liza) toward shore, where fishers standing in shallow water toss their nets. Now, researchers have quantified the benefits for the fishers: They increase the odds of catching mullet 17-fold when they throw their nets in sync with the dolphins\u2019 predatory dives. These mammals use rapid-fire echolocation, a sign of hunting, when the fishers are casting. But this teamwork has become less common during the past 16 years as overfishing by artisanal and commercial fishers has reduced mullet populations, the scientists report this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\n\nFUNDING China\u2019s R&D outlay surges again China\u2019s expenditures on R&D rose 10.4% in 2022, to 3.09 trillion yuan ($457 billion), the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics says. It was the seventh year in a row spending rose by 10% or more. In 2020, China\u2019s R&D spending was about 15% less than that of the United States.\n\nWORKPLACE Lander returns to research jobs Eric Lander, who resigned in February 2022 as President Joe Biden\u2019s top science adviser after an investigation found he bullied subordinates, will resume academic research positions he held before starting that position. He had taken leave from the Broad Institute and faculty positions at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work for the White House. The institute\u2019s director, Todd Golub, wrote Broad researchers last week that \u201cwe have high expectations for all Broadies to foster an inclusive culture of respect. \u2026 Eric also deeply values this culture and is committed to upholding it.\u201d\n\nCLINICAL RESEARCH Hallucinogen tackles depression The psychedelic compound dimethyltryptamine (DMT) has shown promise in treating major depressive disorder in an early stage trial, a drugmaker said last week in a press release. It is one of several hallucinogens medical researchers have been testing for mental disorders such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The short duration of DMT-induced trips, lasting 20 minutes to 1 hour, may offer an alternative to longer treatment sessions needed with other psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD. In the DMT trial, half of the 34 participants received an active dose, the other half only a placebo; all also received supportive therapy. Using a standardized rating scale for major depression, researchers found those who received DMT showed a significant reduction in their symptoms at the end of 2 weeks compared with placebo, according to the firm Small Pharma, which made the test compound.\n\n10 Tubes, containing rock, deposited by NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover on Mars\u2019s surface for possible return to Earth for analysis. They will serve as a backup in case the rover fails to deliver other samples to a future lander.\n\nCONSERVATION Biden nixes mining in U.S. wilderness area The Biden administration blocked new mining and geothermal development in 91,258 hectares in northern Minnesota containing rivers, lakes, and forests for at least 20 years under a decision announced last week. The protected area includes the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and surrounding watershed, which are the most heavily visited wilderness in the United States. The policy reverses one by former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration that opened the way for a copper and nickel mine. Scientists who studied the proposal said pollution from the mine could enter nearby waters. Only Congress can make the mining ban permanent.\n\nCOVID-19 NIH oversight of EcoHealth grant rapped A federal watchdog has found the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) did not properly oversee a grant to the EcoHealth Alliance, a New York City\u2013based nonprofit that funded work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump claimed SARS-CoV-2 could have come from the WIV lab, an idea that many scientists continue to say lacks evidence. Soon after, NIH terminated the EcoHealth grant, which had provided $600,000 to WIV. The 18-month-long audit by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services says NIH did not provide a valid reason for the termination or provide EcoHealth with required information for appealing the decision. The report also finds that \u201cNIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address\u201d problems with the project\u2019s compliance, such as a 2-year delay in a progress report from EcoHealth that described potentially risky virus experiments. And auditors concluded that EcoHealth\u2019s monitoring of WIV eroded once the pandemic started and that EcoHealth had overbilled $90,000 in expenses on NIH grants totaling $8 million from 2014 to 2021. EcoHealth responded that the audit \u201cdid not find significant issues\u201d in its performance. NIH said it is improving its oversight.",

            "text": "One of the fastest growing companies in the global robotic and digital surgery space, Ronovo Surgical, recently raised new financing to accelerate its vision of broad, cross-specialty adoption of robotic-assisted surgery.\n\nThe latest round of financing arms Ronovo with more than $50 million raised since 2020. Led by LongRiver Investments (LRI), this round garnered continued support from existing investors \u2013 Lilly Asia Ventures, Vivo Capital, Matrix Partners China and GGV Capital \u2013 with CEC Capital acting as exclusive financial advisor.\n\nExiting stealth mode, Ronovo unveils its inaugural robotic platform \u2013 Carina, an innovative modular system built on proprietary technology to enable configurable robotic assistance for laparoscopic surgeries across multiple specialties.\n\nThis round of oversubscribed financing will accelerate the multi-discipline clinical trial for Carina, strengthen R&D and clinical applications development, and further bolster the company\u2019s deeply experienced talent base.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with renowned Chinese laparoscopic surgeons, Carina addresses numerous pain points in minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) with a modular and nimble robotic solution.\n\nThe system provides surgeons flexibility to choose the best instruments and the most ideal anatomical access based on laparoscopy foundation.\n\nIn this way, surgeons can leverage \u2013 rather than abandon \u2013 prior laparoscopic training and continue to improve upon their surgical performance, allowing for MIS in more surgical specialties to be performed robotically.\n\nThe innovative modular architecture of Carina minimizes equipment footprint to maximize utilization of precious OR space, thus becoming much more adaptable to typical OR environments in China.\n\nThe surgical team can choose between 3-module or 4-module configuration depending on the expected complexity of the procedure, and the individual modules are freely mobile to join others as needed in different ORs.\n\nSurgeons can also choose from a full suite of instruments to arm each module. Ultimately, the fluidity in configuration translates to balancing clinical capability and procedural cost, resulting in improved usability for the surgical team, higher utilization for the hospital, and reduced economic burden on the patient.\n\nAltogether, the differentiated clinical capabilities and economic viability of the Carina system are poised to rapidly accelerate the adoption of robotic MIS in general surgery, gynecology, thoracic surgery, urology and other specialties.\n\nThese specialties currently see nearly 10 million MIS patients annually in China, with 120,000 laparoscopic surgeons in over 10,000 hospitals.\n\nDr John Ma, founder, chairman and CEO of Ronovo, says: \u201cWe are extremely grateful to our investors for their confidence in Ronovo\u2019s strategy to democratize robotic surgery.\n\n\u201cFrom inception, we have stayed true to our belief that innovation must start from an original pursuit to solve actual unmet clinical needs.\u201d\n\nDr Ying Mao, co-founder and CTO of Ronovo, says: \u201cCarina is designed with modular architecture to overcome the limited adoption of robotic MIS beyond urology.\n\n\u201cThanks to the ingenuity and expertise of our talented team, we have achieved breakthrough in our core robotic technology for the Carina platform.\u201d\n\nJiang Zhang, founder and CEO of LRI, says: \u201cWe are proud to have led this round of financing in Ronovo and its innovative modular robotic platform, which will be first-to-market in China.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly excited to partner with Ronovo to accelerate their product and clinical development, and we strongly believe in the clinical and commercial value of a modular robotic system as well as its viability for international adoption.\u201d\n\nWhile Carina was developed with Chinese laparoscopic surgeons as the use case, early discussions with robotic surgery KOLs in US and Europe indicate the system\u2019s strong potential to overcome current barriers of broad robot-assisted surgery adoptions in many international markets.\n\nRonovo plans to continue discussions with clinical KOLs, strategic partners and global investors at upcoming conferences worldwide, including the LSI Emerging Medtech Summit, MedTech Strategist Innovation Summit, and Society of Robotic & Digital Surgery.\n\nShare this: Print\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nSkype\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPocket\n\n",

            "text": "When a tyre blaze broke out at a Pilbara mine site last year, a firefighting robot helped douse the flames.\n\nIn that harsh environment, tyre fires do happen. Usually, a 300m exclusion zone is put in place for safety, which means assets are left to burn, requiring part of the mine to be shut down for 24 hours.\n\nSo when mine operator Rio Tinto approached Australian robotics company BIA5 to design and build RORI (short for Remotely Operated Rescue Initiative) this was the exact scenario they had in mind.\n\nWithin minutes of the mayday call, RORI, a red firefighting robot that looks like a small tank, was dragging a fire hose hundreds of metres up the haul road towards the burning grader. And in 15 minutes the robot was working to extinguish the fire.\n\nSeeing the robot do its job in a real-world situation was a proud moment for the company, BIA5 Managing Director Shawn Tansley tells Cosmos.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see something catch on fire. But it was kind of nice to see it all come together.\u201d\n\nWith about 10 full time employees, Queensland-based BIA5 designs and manufactures capable, all-terrain robots for a range of high-risk situations encountered in mining, research, policing and defence.\n\nRORI is a red firefighting robot that looks like a small tank / Credit: supplied by BIA5\n\nRobotics companies like BIA5 are worth an estimated $18 billion in annual revenue to the national economy. It\u2019s a sector Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic is hoping to grow with the announcement of Australia\u2019s first National Robotics Strategy due in March.\n\nWhen it comes to robotics and automation, field robotics \u2013 like RORI \u2013 is one of Australia\u2019s niche areas of expertise, according to a 2022 industry roadmap by Robotics Australia Group.\n\nBut the roadmap shows on key industry metrics Australia has some catching up to do.\n\nRobot population density \u2013 the number of industrial robots per 10,000 employees \u2013 is a standard global benchmark, measuring the take up of automation in manufacturing. Australia has 75 robots per 10,000 employees, lagging behind the world average of 113, and Singapore on 918, according to the roadmap. South Korea has 1,000 robots per 10,000 employees according to the International Federation of Robotics.\n\nCountries with higher robot population densities \u2013 Singapore, South Korea, China \u2013 all have well-articulated robotics strategies, and are actually implementing them, Robotics Australia Group chair Dr Sue Keay tells Cosmos.\n\nWhile Australia has been \u201cpretty good\u201d at organically growing its robotics industry, in many ways the sector remains \u201cimmature and fragmented\u201d, she says. A national strategy can provide better links between research, government and industry as well as guideposts to help direct the industry and harness its potential.\n\n\u201cAustralia has developed a lot of robotics, talent and technologies, but for various reasons we\u2019ve often seen that go overseas. I\u2019m very passionate about us making sure we have an environment here in Australia that encourages development of talent and technologies to happen onshore.\u201d\n\nKeay is a member of a government-appointed advisory committee led by CSIRO Chief Scientist Bronwyn Fox which is helping to guide the strategy\u2019s development, including priority areas, issues, risks and consultation.\n\nPending the release of a discussion paper, Cosmos asked local and international robotics experts to offer their opinion about what issues they hope will be addressed.\n\nDirector of Monash Robotics Group, Professor Dana Kuli\u0107 agrees that \u201cAustralia is kind of late to the game\u201d in making robotics a focus of national policy and funding support.\n\nShe tells Cosmos Australia is known for its high-quality robotics research, but \u201csometimes the translation from the academic lab to actual deployment has been the critical gap\u201d.\n\nKuli\u0107 says having custom-built funding designed to support collaboration between research and industry would be helpful.\n\n\u201cThe United States is among the most successful in this regard. There\u2019s this very close interaction between academic researchers and industry, and more flexible arrangements,\u201d she says.\n\nGet an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox. Get a daily dose of science Get a weekly Cosmos Catch-up\n\nFor example, in the US there is a closer industry-academia partnership. Researchers are often involved in start-ups as co-founders or advisers, and the big Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technology companies continue to engage with universities and research institutes on new ideas, she says.\n\nA BIA5 robot designed to explore and survey caves / Credit: supplied by BIA5\n\nTansley says in order to grow, smaller robotics companies like BIA5 often need greater support in the early stages to build their capabilities and connections. He hopes the strategy can help small and medium sized companies to scale, whether that\u2019s through export opportunities, tweaked research and development incentives or encouraging industries like mining to rapidly adopt the technology.\n\nIt\u2019s also crucial that robotics and automation ties in with other related areas of government policy, including work on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, Kuli\u0107 says.\n\n\u201cRobots are also embedded sensor platforms, so they\u2019re collecting a tonne of data. So thinking about questions like data security, privacy is important\u2026 that involves people from cyber security, data science, privacy and ethics.\u201d\n\nThese issues will come to the forefront as increasingly robots are moving out of factories and into public spaces, workplaces and people\u2019s homes.\n\nSo-called service and social robots are being developed and deployed across a wide range of sectors including health, retail, hospitality, transport, education and security.\n\nRestaurant robots are becoming more common in response to staff shortages / Credit: Marcus Brandt / Getty Images)\n\nHuman-computer robot interaction specialist, Dr Katie Seaborn tells Cosmos it will be important the strategy also considers the impact of robotics on people and society, particularly in terms of diversity and inclusion.\n\n\u201cMy big concern is always that we focus so much on the technology and we forget about the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about explainable AI and algorithmic bias in the systems, about how bias is embedded in systems, for quite a number of years now. But the problem persists.\u201d\n\nThere can be a tendency in robotics to narrowly engage with technical experts, whereas she says, it\u2019s important to include a broader range of disciplines such as the social sciences, psychology, ethics, philosophy and diverse perspectives.\n\nMoxi, the robot nurse assistant used in hospitals in the US / Credit: Diligent Robotics\n\nTechnology and human rights researcher Associate Professor Maria Sullivan from Monash University says the national strategy can create more consistency within the federal system.\n\nShe says there\u2019s an opportunity for greater interaction between states and territories particularly when it comes to issues like security, health care, and broader questions of safety, privacy, surveillance, ethics and discrimination.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u201cThe robot broke the child\u2019s finger\u2026 this is of course bad\u201d\n\nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto: Gendering robots is a cognitive shortcut that can lead to short circuits\n\nOnce the discussion paper is released, Keay hopes to hear from the broader public as well as industry, interest groups and experts on their vision for robotics in Australia.\n\n\u201cI just hope the strategy is a way for Australia to take advantage of these technological advances, rather than having them thrust upon us,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cRobotics and artificial intelligence are going to have a significant impact on everybody\u2019s lives. It\u2019d be better if we could get ahead of how that technology is going to be applied. And make sure people can either up-skill or re-skill to make sure they feel confident in using the technology.\u201d",

            "text": "Jeff Bezos is known for establishing the global online retail giant Amazon.com. He was its CEO from 1994 to July 2021, when he stepped down from his role.\n\nHe became an executive chairman and sold most of his shares. Since then, his focus has been on space technology and education.\n\nOne of his crucial education programs is Future Engineer. It is a child-to-career program that trains students in computer science.\n\nHis Bezos Earth Fund program is in Canada, US, and UK. It is an education and advocacy program that promotes natural climate solutions.\n\nPractical training over theory\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education mainly focus on practical, hands-on experience training in school. Beneficiaries are trained in technical skills which prepare them for the labor market.\n\nDue to this, students under the Bezos programs only get a little time to learn text writing from the teacher and are often left wondering who can \u2018write my college paper?\u2019\n\nIt is natural because non-ending assignments hinder a student\u2019s academic progress. That is why online technology tools and innovation in how students do their assignments are highly needed.\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education also revolve around offering technical training. In all his education programs, he puts much emphasis on providing hands-on knowledge.\n\nHe argues the world is changing fast and requires learners who are changing fast. Based on his view, practical training helps students to learn fast adaptations to fast-changing scenarios.\n\nIt is a strategy used to develop interdisciplinary knowledge in students. He believes it exposes them to modern technological developments. That is one of the reasons his programs mainly focus on computer science.\n\nHe believes computer science helps learners become problem solvers. It supports the development of essential interpersonal skills.\n\nCoding is one of the main areas of knowledge beneficiaries learn. It is essential for working in many fields, such as aerospace and robotics.\n\nThey are the main areas Bezos wants to invest in to grow future technologies. He believes robotics will transform Amazon and space science.\n\nConquering space and investing in education\n\nJeff Bezos is determined to conquer space and invest in education. He seeks to build machines transporting people to the moon and mars.\n\nHe expects to achieve this through his space science company Blue Origin. Plans are underway to launch a private space station by 2030.\n\nHis views drive him to invest much of his wealth in promoting early childhood education. In October 2020, he hinted he would spend $2 billion on Day One Fund.\n\nIt aims to help needy families get shelter, food, and total education scholarships.\n\nThe scholarships will be channeled through Montessori-inspired pre-schools. Beneficiaries are already learning free of charge. It is a year-round program targeting children of ages 3-5 years.\n\nJeff Bezos plans to spend nearly all his wealth on education and space exploration.\n\nTheoretical education is based on scoring high grades.\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education do not favor theoretical training. He believes it is disadvantaged because it is more about grades. If students fail to score high, they are seen as failures and untalented.\n\nTheoretical training does not help a student understand how to apply the knowledge in the real world. They may perform perfectly on books but poorly in the job market.\n\nThe training takes a long time to complete, yet it bears fewer fruits. It only produces a large amount of text that eventually becomes unmanageable.\n\nPractical training offers tangible evidence to students. Jeff Bezos runs several educational programs to meet his vision for practical training.\n\nThe Future Engineer childhood-to-career program\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education are based on the belief that how people learn shapes what they become.\n\nHis Future Engineer childhood-to-career program targets children and young adults.\n\nThe program provides access to computer science education to needy students.\n\nThey learn coding and other computer courses that prepare them for the career market.\n\nBezo scholars \u2013 Harnessing youth power and leadership\n\nTo understand Jeff Bezos\u2019s educational views, you must understand the Bezo Scholars program. Its idea was born in 2005 during the Aspen Ideas Festival. The festival brought together leaders from around the earth.\n\nIts founders, Jackie, and Mike Bezos, had attended the festival. They wondered why there was no youth. The program offers youth leadership development knowledge.\n\nIt targets youth from North America and Africa regions. It runs for one year and prepares students to make a difference in their communities. Each year, the program targets 17 exceptional youth who receive free full-year training.\n\nThey learn how to solve urgent problems and become competent leaders in society.\n\nMontessori style pre-schools\n\nThe schools target young children and offer free education. Bezos has built the schools and hired teachers and administrators. Many of the workers in the pre-schools are former Amazon employees.\n\nThe target beneficiaries are children from needy families. The education style is based on self-directed activities. Children get hands-on learning plus collaborative play.\n\nThey learn under highly trained educators who guide them based on their age.\n\nConclusion\n\nAbout two years ago, Jeff Bezos resigned as Amazon.com CEO. Since then, he has been focused on conquering space and investing in education. Bezos plans to spend almost all of his wealth on space exploration and education.\n\nHis views on education are that education should be practical based. It is what prepares students to become problem solvers. He is currently running several education programs as part of his vision.",

            "text": "End users are looking to machine builders to provide innovative solutions that improve upon the speed and accuracy of manual-based applications while maintaining the same level of flexibility. Improving Materials Processing With Robotics Alex Bonaire, Product Manager - Robotic | Omron Automation\n\nOperations in industries like food and commodity, waste processing, and agriculture often involve processing and/or packaging materials at extremely fast rates. End users are looking to machine builders to provide innovative solutions that improve upon the speed and accuracy of manual-based applications while maintaining the same level of flexibility. For solutions using fixed machinery, speed and accuracy may not be as pressing an issue, but flexibility often leaves much to be desired.\n\nRobots can readily address these concerns. That being true, many professionals in these industries hold on to beliefs that robots are difficult to use, overly expensive relative to their ROI, and unable to address complicated and/or unstructured applications. However, today\u2019s robotic technology makes the above assertions no longer valid.\n\nTypical challenges in pick-and-place applications\n\nToday\u2019s high-speed pick-and-place applications often have parts or product coming by on a conveyor belt that never stops moving. In some cases, such as is commonly the case in food and beverage packaging, there may be multiple product types that need to be packaged together into the same box in varying assortments. The configuration of these assortments may change daily depending on the number of varieties offered by the manufacturer, and new ones are often needed to adapt to market pressures.\n\nWhen fixed machinery is used, the system might not adapt well to any changes to a product or assortment. Oftentimes, separate machines are required to process the full range of products, a costly strategy both in terms of financial expenses and floor space. Frequently, when a particular product configuration is being processed, the machinery used for the other varieties will lie dormant. When machinery does offer flexibility, it is typically a very complex mechanical system that has numerous failure points and requires an extended changeover period while operators swap out parts and adjust it to run the next variant.\n\nIn situations that use manual sorting instead of fixed machinery, a pick-and-place application would involve a (potentially quite large) team of people standing next to the conveyor belts, picking things off the line, and sorting them into boxes. Since this type of work is quite mind-numbing and has some potential for repetitive motion injuries, it leads to low employee satisfaction and high turnover. Given today\u2019s labor shortage, the pressures of keeping these applications fully staffed become too high.\n\nRobots\u2019 flexibility, speed, and accuracy makes them ideal for fast-paced pick-and-place\n\nThe benefits of robots in and of themselves are significant by their ability to integrate seamlessly with a variety of other automation technologies. As compared with having employees perform pick-and-place tasks manually, robots have significant advantages in terms of speed, accuracy, and the ability to work round-the-clock. When a conveyor is going at high speeds, human workers may have difficulty keeping up, and may begin to make mistakes as a result.\n\nFurthermore, the monotony of a particular task \u2014 or its unsavory aspects, such as handling dirty or otherwise unsavory material (like unwashed produce, greasy or sharp components, and even waste items) \u2014 matters little to a robot, whereas human workers would see this as a reason to start looking for a new job immediately. Many robots are also designed to be immune to harsh environments that would be quite difficult \u2014 and potentially hazardous \u2014 for people to work in. Overall, robots provide labor-related benefits such as nonstop operation, reduced labor turnover, and the reduction or elimination of work related injuries.\n\nRobots can easily adapt to a new product design or configuration with very simple, quick programming changes. For example, once the robot system is set up, users can easily switch from one program to another with the touch of a button, and the robot automatically switches from processing variant \u201cA\u201d to variant \u201cF.\u201d When a new variant is needed, the modular process architecture of the software lets users quickly reconfigure the entire pick-and-place process without writing code or creating new programs.\n\nRobots have unique capabilities when integrated with other automation technologies\n\nRobots by themselves are highly flexible additions to any production line. However, when paired with other technologies, their benefits are compounded. Ultimately, robots can function as part of a fully integrated, factory-wide solution that incorporates machine vision, traceability, servo motion, and safety.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious technology to pair with a robot is a vision system. Powerful machine vision allows robots to quickly recognize and categorize products. In tandem with pick-and place, a vision system not only enables the robot to locate a part in space (even while in motion) without the need for a fixed location, but it can also perform inspections to detect any product defects and prompt the robot to place faulty items in a discard bin.\n\nVision systems can also take care of traceability needs by capturing the barcodes placed on individual products and making sure that all components of an assortment are present. Additionally, in dynamic applications like those when robots need to pick from moving conveyors, vision systems can help the robot maximize its pick rate by indicating which parts are most optimally positioned to pick next.\n\nRobots are capable of high-speed motion with very fast cycle times, but some applications have such high throughput requirements that even the fastest robot would not be able to keep up. Such applications can benefit from multiple robots working together to share the load. If a combo box-packing application is designed to have such high throughput that a single robot cannot manage all the items, a second robot can capture the items missed by the first one. More robots mean that more items can be processed in your application and strategic positioning of the robots can be implemented to optimize the pick process and/or increase flexibility. Furthermore, robots can share information between themselves to not only to ensure that all items are picked but can also balance the workload so that each robot is processing an equal number of items.\n\nIntegrate Parallel robot with the rest of the factory automation technologies and controlled altogether on a single programmable logic controller (PLC) provides several advantages. For instance, if the conveyor is controlled by the same PLC, the robots can dynamically adjust conveyor speed to adapt to product flow and/or stop the conveyor if the need arises to ensure all items are picked. If the conveyor is servo driven, its motion can be synced in real time with the robots so that these technologies dynamically adjust their own motion based on changes to throughput and with micrometer precision.\n\nEnd users looking to move beyond manual or fixed-machinery solutions for high-speed pick and-place can benefit greatly from the speed, precision, and flexibility of robots, especially from robots that are designed to achieve exceptionally high speeds with high levels of stability. When integrated with other automation technologies as part of a connected factory, today\u2019s most advanced robotic solutions can communicate directly with vision systems, conveyors, and other devices to autonomously respond to changing throughput and configuration needs.\n\nThe content & opinions in this article are the author\u2019s and do not necessarily represent the views of RoboticsTomorrow\n\nOmron Automation Omron is an industrial automation partner that creates, sells and services fully integrated automation solutions that include robotics, sensing, motion, logic, safety, and more for manufacturers in the automotive, semiconductor, food and beverage packaging and other industries.

In an interview with CNN, the artist explains how he came up with the artwork. According to Jafri, \u201cThe original artwork was this beautiful heart motif. Two figures entwined, reconnecting and around them is blossoming flora, fauna.\u201d He further added that he wants to capture \u201cthe unification of humanity through love and empathy\u201d in his work.\n\nThe next space race: Jeff Koons and painter Sacha Jafri are competing to be the first to exhibit their artwork on the moon https://t.co/OMp4dxn22Q \u2014 The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) April 8, 2022\n\nFor the artwork\u2019s canvas, the gold alloy was developed over two years to combat the extreme environment of the moon. And the best part? The artwork will be available for sale on Earth through an NFT medium, with the entire process transpiring in a unique way. Once the physical artwork lands on the moon, little beep sounds will be heard in the control room and through that signal, 88 NFTs will be released for sale on Earth. Sounds pretty cool, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nNot just this, Jafri also plans on donating all the sale proceeds to humanitarian charities and raising money for the four main charitable concerns of the world such as health, education, sustainability and equality.\n\nThis artwork was commissioned by Spacebit, a UK-based company that develops space robotics technology and data analytics tools, and will be launched onto the lunar surface by Spacebit and NASA Commercial Payload Services (CLPS). While the launch of NFTs for sale will be facilitated by Selenian Network, a UAE-based company that specializes in blockchain technologies.\n\nHow are they launching the moon art?\n\nThe moon art will be launched into space on a United Launch Alliance rocket that will take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The moon art will be placed by a lunar lander called Lacus Mortis. The launch mission will take between five days and two weeks to reach the moon, depending on conditions.\n\n(Hero and feature image credits: Courtesy Instagram/Sacha Jafri)",
