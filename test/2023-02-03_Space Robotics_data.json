The US, he adds, is already \u201cin active competition with Russia and China for freedom of action and dominance of the space domain. And it\u2019s evolving very quickly.\u201d\n\nSo on January 26 last year, the former US Air Force major incorporated True Anomaly, Inc to \u201csolve the most challenging orbital warfare problems for the US Space Force,\u201d he later tweeted.\n\nAccording to a recent filing with the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC), True Anomaly is now gearing up for its first orbital mission. In October, True Anomaly hopes to launch two Jackal \u201corbital pursuit\u201d spacecraft aboard a SpaceX rocket to low earth orbit. The Jackals will not house guns, warheads, or laser blasters, but they will be capable of rendezvous proximity operations (RPO)\u2014the ability to maneuver close to other satellites and train a battery of sensors upon them. This could reveal their rivals\u2019 surveillance and weapons systems or help intercept communications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their first mission, dubbed Demo-1, the Jackals will merely spy on each other, using thrusters, radar, and multi-spectral cameras to approach within a few hundred meters. If that goes well, Rogers envisages deploying thousands of autonomous spacecraft in service of the US military, controlled by a team of human operators and AI \u201cto pursue adversaries wherever they fly, and to provide the tools of accountability.\u201d\n\nThose tools start with understanding what technologies America\u2019s adversaries are deploying in space. \u201cBut an active defense is going to be required,\u201d says Rogers, now True Anomaly\u2019s CEO. \u201cIf you take the job of defense and protection of the domain seriously, you have to have the ability to do the joint functions of maneuver and fires.\u201d Although the military often uses \u201cfires\u201d to mean kinetic weapons like guns and shells, in the space context, it usually refers to jamming, electronic warfare, and cyberattacks.\n\nNothing on True Anomaly\u2019s website suggests that it is developing its own offensive weapons. However, in a series of posts last summer, Rogers tweeted: \u201cTactically disabling enemy spacecraft can be the difference between the loss of an entire Carrier Strike Group or its survival... And there are many ways to destroy spacecraft that don\u2019t ruin the environment. After all, they are just floating computers.\u201d",

            "text": "There are still robotics jobs to be found (if you know where to look) Actuator: More on Amazon layoffs, advice for recent grads, running on sand\n\nA lot has happened in the half-year since we caught up with Ayanna Howard, dean of the Ohio State University\u2019s College of Engineering \u2014 not all of it good. The broader economic slowdown has been deeply felt by the robotics industry, across the board, from the smallest startups to the biggest tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nUnderstandably, a lot of the coverage has centered around the impact and companies and those who\u2019ve lost jobs in the process. One key thing we don\u2019t discuss as often are the people currently hunting for jobs \u2014 both those who are recently out of one and people who are brand-new to the market.\n\nCatching up with Dean Howard is a perfect opportunity to discuss the latter, both in terms of what the market looks like for recent and soon-to-be grads and what companies can do to recruit and engage folks who are brand-new to the job market. This week, we\u2019re kicking things off with that Q&A, then diving into the first batch of job listings we promised last week and moving on to your regularly scheduled robotics roundup.\n\nActuator, activate!\n\nQ&A with Dean Ayanna Howard\n\nTC: How are your students feeling about the job market \u2014 robotics in particular?\n\nAH: I think there\u2019s a little bit of apprehension, but the fact is there\u2019s still jobs that are open, especially for new hires. When you\u2019re new talent, you\u2019re at a lower rate, obviously. Sometimes you\u2019re more creative and willing to do a little more than what the job is, because you don\u2019t know what the job is.\n\nPrior to the downturn, were students more excited to go into the world of Big Tech or startups?\n\nIt was mixed. I really depended on whether they [had a] bachelor\u2019s or a master\u2019s. I found that a lot of students, if they were going to go into the startup world, it would be with a mature startup. It wasn\u2019t one that was just a year or two out. It was one that had at least a Series A. [\u2026] Now I think there\u2019s more of a focus on, \u2018Let\u2019s go with a large, more established company, just because they\u2019ll last.\n\nNow robotics is something that touches every other category, so there are a lot of robotics jobs to be had outside of strictly robotics companies.\n\nCorrect. I consider self-driving cars to be robotics. It\u2019s everything. You have control systems, you have autonomy, you have interaction with people. It\u2019s a classic robotics system that just happens to have a car form factor. Even in that domain, you saw a lot of startups close down, but the large companies have invested a lot more into that and EVs.\n\nWhat can schools do to train students for the job market?\n\nAt Ohio State, we have instituted some programs within the last year around entrepreneurism in startups, around very specific areas. For example, manufacturing, healthcare. Things that we know we\u2019ll always need innovation in. Large companies need that entrepreneurial thinking and mindset, because it allows them to innovate within the company structure. When companies don\u2019t innovate, they tend to be archaic, and when the startup culture comes back up, they\u2019re gonna eat their corn.\n\nAs far as your own experience running a startup, how did you determine when to hire a student versus someone more senior?\n\nFor the technical talent, it was really new hires. It was because I needed fresh ideas. We needed to know the latest and the greatest, and they would have the education. For marketing and sales, that was much more established. We hired much more seasoned individuals.\n\nWhat tips would you give for startups hiring recent grads?\n\nDon\u2019t put them on a critical path, starting off, because you might be disappointed if they don\u2019t rise to the challenge. But do give them things that require them to push the boundary conditions. If you hire them for front-end development or graphics, think about things that are tangential that I can push them in so that they can learn. [\u2026] You, as a manager, have to be much more strategic, and you have to lay it out.\n\nYou do still have to do a little hand-holding. I don\u2019t want to call it \u201cmicromanagement,\u201d but you do have to set deliverables, set milestones, and if they don\u2019t meet it, go back and ask them why they didn\u2019t meet it. Not reprimanding, but asking why. Sometimes what you\u2019ll find is they\u2019ll get stuck in certain areas you didn\u2019t anticipate, and then you can push them.\n\nI tend to think generational warfare is silly, but what would you say to those people who suggest that younger millennials and Gen Z are too sensitive or don\u2019t have a work ethic?\n\nI think their motivation is different. The work ethic versus the too sensitive \u2014 this generation is passionate about certain things. They are impassionate about others. When you find what they\u2019re passionate about, whatever it is \u2014 social impact or design software for underserved communities \u2014 you get them there and they will work throughout the night. When we think about work ethic, it\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve got to show up to work every day.\u201d But if they\u2019re not interested, they can be a little slower or not responsive. It\u2019s a different type of work ethic.\n\nJob Openings\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of helplessness associated with economic downturns. It\u2019s the knowledge that \u2014 in the long run \u2014 no one\u2019s job is truly safe. The way we\u2019ve structured society means the farther down the ladder you are in regards to money and seniority, the more you\u2019re regarded as being expendable.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve been spared, there\u2019s little consolation in a corporation\u2019s pledge to be more scrappy and return to its long-dormant startup roots when you\u2019ve seen so many colleagues suddenly out of work. For those of us who\u2019ve been through that experience, it\u2019s clear that corporate layoffs are indiscriminate when it comes to the individual. When push comes to shove, we all become rounding errors.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of positive feedback on social media reiterating the fact that layoffs aren\u2019t personal. Certainly that\u2019s true for the company doing the laying off, but it\u2019s quite the opposite for the people on the receiving end. Layoffs are deeply personal. They disrupt our lives, our livelihoods, our motivations, our relationships. They contribute to depression and a laundry list of different conditions.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s been working in the world of publishing for a long time now, I\u2019ve been on the receiving end a few times. I understand that you can tell someone that something isn\u2019t their fault a million times over, but it can feel like a platitude. Moral support is extremely important during the process \u2014 but so are actionable items. Help good people find good jobs. We talk a lot about how work shouldn\u2019t define you, but it takes up more waking hours than anything else. People should be able to find work that is fulfilling and makes them feel valued.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like you to take away from this, it\u2019s the fact that people are hurting. If you can help, help. Simple, I know, but if you need a less altruistic motivator, understand that the people you help now may well be in a position to help you later.\n\nI\u2019m hoping we can use Actuator as a platform to do just that. As I mentioned previously, each week I\u2019m going to feature a handful of companies in the robotics space that are hiring. I don\u2019t have a timeline for how long we\u2019ll be running this \u2014 a lot of that depends on the level of interest among job seekers. The plan for the moment, however, is to keep this going during the current downturn.\n\nI learned a long time ago that hiring is a key reason companies seek out coverage at a place like TechCrunch, and I understand that Actuator\u2019s readers are precisely the sort of people these organizations are looking for. We\u2019re not becoming a job board and won\u2019t post individual positions, but hopefully curating a list will prove useful for job seekers.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be included, shoot me a line with your company\u2019s name and how many positions you\u2019re hiring for (if you don\u2019t include the number, I will attempt to count). And, hey, if you end up landing a new gig based on something you found here, let me know on Twitter. Everyone loves a happy ending.\n\nRobotics Companies That Are Hiring\n\nGrayMatter Robotics (11 openings)\n\nScythe Robotics (6 openings)\n\nViam Robotics (10 openings)\n\nRoundup\n\nAndy Jassy and a few other C-level folks aside, it seems no one was entirely safe from Amazon\u2019s sweeping job cuts. While it\u2019s been one of the retail behemoth\u2019s main future-proofing focuses of the last decade, Amazon Robotics is reportedly among the divisions impacted by this latest round. CNBC notes that a broad range of roles were targeted in the division, including engineers and product managers. Drone delivery service Prime Air was also disproportionately impacted here.\n\nThis week, Boston Dynamics offered some of the first footage of its Stretch robot being put to work at DHL. Stretch, as you\u2019ll recall, is the Hyundai-owned firm\u2019s second commercial robot, following Spot. It\u2019s based on the earlier Handle robot and is designed for exclusively unloading trucks/trailers, conveyor belts and pallets. Companies like DHL are the seemingly perfect target for the product, and fittingly, the logistics giant became one of Boston Dynamics\u2019 first customers, with a $15 million product purchase a year ago last week.\n\nTaking us out this week is Raibo, a robot dog recently highlighted in the pages of Science Robotics that\u2019s capable of running on sand at high speeds. Per the paper:\n\nOur model can be parameterized to represent diverse types of terrain from very soft beach sand to hard asphalt. In addition, we introduce an adaptive control architecture that can implicitly identify the terrain properties as the robot feels the terrain. The identified parameters are then used to boost the locomotion performance of the legged robot.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap for this week. To get Actuator in your inbox, sign up here.",

            "text": "Robots and A.I. team up to discover highly selective catalysts\n\n(Nanowerk News) Researchers used a chemical synthesis robot and computationally cost effective A.I. model to successfully predict and validate highly selective catalysts (Angewandte Chemie International Edition, \"Predicting Highly Enantioselective Catalysts Using Tunable Fragment Descriptors\").\n\nArtificial intelligence (A.I.) has made headlines recently with the advent of ChatGPT's language processing capabilities. Creating a similarly powerful tool for chemical reaction design remains a significant challenge, especially for complex catalytic reactions. To help address this challenge, researchers at the Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery and the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung have demonstrated a machine learning method that utilizes advanced yet efficient 2D chemical descriptors to accurately predict highly selective asymmetric catalysts\u2014without the need for quantum chemical computations.\n\n\u201cThere have been several advanced technologies which can \u201cpredict\u201d catalyst structures, but those methods often required large investments of calculation resources and time; yet their accuracy was still limited,\u201d said joint first author Nobuya Tsuji. \u201cIn this project, we have developed a predictive model which you can run even with an everyday laptop PC.\u201d\n\nClose up of the semi-automated synthesis robot used to generate training data. (Image: ICReDD)\n\nFor a computer to learn chemical information, molecules are usually represented as a collection of descriptors, which often consist of small parts, or fragments, of those molecules. These are easier for A.I. to process and can be arranged and rearranged to construct different molecules, much like Lego pieces can be arranged and connected in different ways to construct different structures.\n\nHowever, computationally cheaper 2D descriptors have struggled to accurately represent complex catalyst structures, leading to inaccurate predictions. To improve this issue, researchers developed new Circular Substructure (CircuS) 2D descriptors that explicitly represent cyclic and branched hydrocarbon structures, which are common in catalysis. Training data for the A.I. was obtained through experiments via a streamlined, semi-automatic process utilizing a synthesis robot. This experimental data was then converted into descriptors and used to train the A.I. model.\n\nResearchers used the fully trained model to virtually test 190 catalysts not part of the training data. In this set, the A.I. model was able to predict highly selective catalysts after only having been trained on the data of catalysts with moderate selectivity, showing an ability to extrapolate beyond the training data.\n\nThe catalyst predicted to have the highest selectivity was then tested experimentally, exhibiting a selectivity nearly identical to that predicted by the A.I. model. Obtaining high selectivity is especially crucial for the design of new medicines, and this technique provides chemists with a powerful framework for optimizing selectivity that is efficient in both computational and labor cost.\n\nFast and robust predictive models using 2D descriptors particularly suited for asymmetric catalysis. Highly selective catalysts were predicted and validated using training data with only moderate selectivities (Image: Nobuya Tsuji, Pavel Sidorov, et al) (click on image to enlarge)",

            "text": "SPACE FLIGHT Nuclear rocket eyed for Mars trips NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) plan to launch and test a nuclear-powered rocket engine in space as soon as 2027, the agencies announced last week. Such engines promise higher thrust and efficiency than conventional ones, enabling faster travel times and bigger payloads for human missions to Mars, the agencies say. Although NASA has experimented with nuclear engines since the 1960s, none has been demonstrated in space. Powered by low-enriched uranium, the engine\u2019s fission reactor will heat and vaporize liquid propellants, shooting the gases out of a nozzle to provide thrust. NASA will provide the engine and DARPA the experimental spacecraft that will carry it. The design plans include a safety review.\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES Pandemic declaration extended Three years after it started, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this week. But a special emergency committee for the disease hinted that the designation\u2014which gives WHO recommendations more heft and can influence travel and quarantine policies\u2014might end later this year. Since WHO first declared COVID-19 a PHEIC on 30 January 2020, the panel has recommended 11 times to keep the designation in place. Although COVID-19 is causing fewer deaths now than 1 year ago, it \u201cremains a dangerous infectious disease,\u201d the panel said, with more than 170,000 COVID-19\u2013related deaths reported within the past 8 weeks, about 80,000 of them in China. The committee encouraged WHO to integrate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance into monitoring of influenza viruses. It asked the agency to assess how ending the PHEIC would affect the development and authorization of COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Separately, the administration of President Joe Biden said this week it will end the U.S. declaration of a national public health emergency in May . That policy has, for example, paid for COVID-19 testing and treatment for people lacking health insurance.\n\nWORKPLACE Scientists\u2019 job joy stays strong Job satisfaction in 2021 among U.S. scientists and engineers holding Ph.D.s matched the high levels recorded prepandemic, according to survey findings reported last week by the U.S. National Science Foundation. Across academe, government, and industry, between 89% and 95% of respondents said they were very or somewhat satisfied with their principal job, about the same levels as in 2019. Employment also stayed high, at about 85%. In 2021, 3% reported that COVID-19 influenced them to work only part time or not at all, for example because of pandemic-related family responsibilities, reduced hours, or layoffs, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients found.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH Reports of Long Covid wane Long Covid\u2019s prevalence among Americans who\u2019ve had the virus is declining, a survey indicates. The new data come from the Household Pulse Survey, run by the U.S. Census Bureau; during the pandemic, it has added questions about COVID-19. The most recent results, analyzed last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, showed that in June 2022, 19% of people who reported having had a bout of COVID-19 said they had Long Covid when they took the survey. By January, that number had dropped to 11%. The decline suggests at least some people are recovering from the chronic, disabling symptoms, such as fatigue and breathlessness, associated with Long Covid. It also suggests the risk of developing Long Covid may have dropped over time. Still, the U.S. prevalence is about 6%, as researchers study how to treat it.\n\nANIMAL BEHAVIOR Dolphins boost fishers\u2019 haul Fishers and dolphins work together to catch mullet at Praia da Tesoura in Laguna, Brazil. F\u00c1BIO DAURA-JORGE/FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF SANTA CATARINA For more than a century, artisanal fishers in southern Brazil have worked alongside wild bottlenose dolphins in an unusual example of cooperative hunting. The dolphins chase a 40-centimeter-long fish called the Lebranche mullet (Mugil liza) toward shore, where fishers standing in shallow water toss their nets. Now, researchers have quantified the benefits for the fishers: They increase the odds of catching mullet 17-fold when they throw their nets in sync with the dolphins\u2019 predatory dives. These mammals use rapid-fire echolocation, a sign of hunting, when the fishers are casting. But this teamwork has become less common during the past 16 years as overfishing by artisanal and commercial fishers has reduced mullet populations, the scientists report this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\n\nFUNDING China\u2019s R&D outlay surges again China\u2019s expenditures on R&D rose 10.4% in 2022, to 3.09 trillion yuan ($457 billion), the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics says. It was the seventh year in a row spending rose by 10% or more. In 2020, China\u2019s R&D spending was about 15% less than that of the United States.\n\nWORKPLACE Lander returns to research jobs Eric Lander, who resigned in February 2022 as President Joe Biden\u2019s top science adviser after an investigation found he bullied subordinates, will resume academic research positions he held before starting that position. He had taken leave from the Broad Institute and faculty positions at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work for the White House. The institute\u2019s director, Todd Golub, wrote Broad researchers last week that \u201cwe have high expectations for all Broadies to foster an inclusive culture of respect. \u2026 Eric also deeply values this culture and is committed to upholding it.\u201d\n\nCLINICAL RESEARCH Hallucinogen tackles depression The psychedelic compound dimethyltryptamine (DMT) has shown promise in treating major depressive disorder in an early stage trial, a drugmaker said last week in a press release. It is one of several hallucinogens medical researchers have been testing for mental disorders such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The short duration of DMT-induced trips, lasting 20 minutes to 1 hour, may offer an alternative to longer treatment sessions needed with other psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD. In the DMT trial, half of the 34 participants received an active dose, the other half only a placebo; all also received supportive therapy. Using a standardized rating scale for major depression, researchers found those who received DMT showed a significant reduction in their symptoms at the end of 2 weeks compared with placebo, according to the firm Small Pharma, which made the test compound.\n\n10 Tubes, containing rock, deposited by NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover on Mars\u2019s surface for possible return to Earth for analysis. They will serve as a backup in case the rover fails to deliver other samples to a future lander.\n\nCONSERVATION Biden nixes mining in U.S. wilderness area The Biden administration blocked new mining and geothermal development in 91,258 hectares in northern Minnesota containing rivers, lakes, and forests for at least 20 years under a decision announced last week. The protected area includes the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and surrounding watershed, which are the most heavily visited wilderness in the United States. The policy reverses one by former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration that opened the way for a copper and nickel mine. Scientists who studied the proposal said pollution from the mine could enter nearby waters. Only Congress can make the mining ban permanent.\n\nCOVID-19 NIH oversight of EcoHealth grant rapped A federal watchdog has found the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) did not properly oversee a grant to the EcoHealth Alliance, a New York City\u2013based nonprofit that funded work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump claimed SARS-CoV-2 could have come from the WIV lab, an idea that many scientists continue to say lacks evidence. Soon after, NIH terminated the EcoHealth grant, which had provided $600,000 to WIV. The 18-month-long audit by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services says NIH did not provide a valid reason for the termination or provide EcoHealth with required information for appealing the decision. The report also finds that \u201cNIH did not effectively monitor or take timely action to address\u201d problems with the project\u2019s compliance, such as a 2-year delay in a progress report from EcoHealth that described potentially risky virus experiments. And auditors concluded that EcoHealth\u2019s monitoring of WIV eroded once the pandemic started and that EcoHealth had overbilled $90,000 in expenses on NIH grants totaling $8 million from 2014 to 2021. EcoHealth responded that the audit \u201cdid not find significant issues\u201d in its performance. NIH said it is improving its oversight.",

Led by LongRiver Investments (LRI), this round garnered continued support from existing investors \u2013 Lilly Asia Ventures, Vivo Capital, Matrix Partners China and GGV Capital \u2013 with CEC Capital acting as exclusive financial advisor.\n\nExiting stealth mode, Ronovo unveils its inaugural robotic platform \u2013 Carina, an innovative modular system built on proprietary technology to enable configurable robotic assistance for laparoscopic surgeries across multiple specialties.\n\nThis round of oversubscribed financing will accelerate the multi-discipline clinical trial for Carina, strengthen R&D and clinical applications development, and further bolster the company\u2019s deeply experienced talent base.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with renowned Chinese laparoscopic surgeons, Carina addresses numerous pain points in minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) with a modular and nimble robotic solution.\n\nThe system provides surgeons flexibility to choose the best instruments and the most ideal anatomical access based on laparoscopy foundation.\n\nIn this way, surgeons can leverage \u2013 rather than abandon \u2013 prior laparoscopic training and continue to improve upon their surgical performance, allowing for MIS in more surgical specialties to be performed robotically.\n\nThe innovative modular architecture of Carina minimizes equipment footprint to maximize utilization of precious OR space, thus becoming much more adaptable to typical OR environments in China.\n\nThe surgical team can choose between 3-module or 4-module configuration depending on the expected complexity of the procedure, and the individual modules are freely mobile to join others as needed in different ORs.\n\nSurgeons can also choose from a full suite of instruments to arm each module. Ultimately, the fluidity in configuration translates to balancing clinical capability and procedural cost, resulting in improved usability for the surgical team, higher utilization for the hospital, and reduced economic burden on the patient.\n\nAltogether, the differentiated clinical capabilities and economic viability of the Carina system are poised to rapidly accelerate the adoption of robotic MIS in general surgery, gynecology, thoracic surgery, urology and other specialties.\n\nThese specialties currently see nearly 10 million MIS patients annually in China, with 120,000 laparoscopic surgeons in over 10,000 hospitals.\n\nDr John Ma, founder, chairman and CEO of Ronovo, says: \u201cWe are extremely grateful to our investors for their confidence in Ronovo\u2019s strategy to democratize robotic surgery.\n\n\u201cFrom inception, we have stayed true to our belief that innovation must start from an original pursuit to solve actual unmet clinical needs.\u201d\n\nDr Ying Mao, co-founder and CTO of Ronovo, says: \u201cCarina is designed with modular architecture to overcome the limited adoption of robotic MIS beyond urology.\n\n\u201cThanks to the ingenuity and expertise of our talented team, we have achieved breakthrough in our core robotic technology for the Carina platform.\u201d\n\nJiang Zhang, founder and CEO of LRI, says: \u201cWe are proud to have led this round of financing in Ronovo and its innovative modular robotic platform, which will be first-to-market in China.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly excited to partner with Ronovo to accelerate their product and clinical development, and we strongly believe in the clinical and commercial value of a modular robotic system as well as its viability for international adoption.\u201d\n\nWhile Carina was developed with Chinese laparoscopic surgeons as the use case, early discussions with robotic surgery KOLs in US and Europe indicate the system\u2019s strong potential to overcome current barriers of broad robot-assisted surgery adoptions in many international markets.\n\nRonovo plans to continue discussions with clinical KOLs, strategic partners and global investors at upcoming conferences worldwide, including the LSI Emerging Medtech Summit, MedTech Strategist Innovation Summit, and Society of Robotic & Digital Surgery.\n\nShare this: Print\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nSkype\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPocket\n\n",

It\u2019s used for high-level drone professionals, particularly law enforcement and other First Responders, extensively in the United States.\n\nLeveraging critical new funding from the Government of Canada\u2019s support through FedDev Ontario, the new facility at Area X.O will be the first of its kind in Canada. With instruction provided InDro Robotics, it will harness the capabilities and infrastructure of Area X.O, and create an entirely new resource for Canadian innovators and companies in a year-round setting.\n\nExtensive drone training\u2026\n\nThe facility will offer multiple options for drone training, in addition to the new high-level course. These will include obtaining Basic and Advanced RPAS certificates, along with on-site flight reviews.\n\nInDro already has an extensive background with training First Responders, as well as advanced commercial pilots. We\u2019ve done this at InDro facilities and on-site for clients. And the online portal FLYY is a collaboration with Kate Klassen, one of Canada\u2019s most respected drone instructors.\n\n\u201cOnline instruction is a tremendous tool,\u201d says Klassen. \u201cBut there\u2019s something to be said for in-person, hands-on training once you\u2019re talking about highly specialised skills.\u201d\n\nThe facility will combine aerial and ground robotic training and testing \u2013 all in a single location.\n\nRobots\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the drones. InDro Robotics and Area X.O strive to offer training, skills development and evaluation of the capabilities of robots.\n\nWant to learn how to teleoperate a robot? You\u2019ll do it here.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be able to put your robot (or one of InDro\u2019s) through its paces. You\u2019ll be operating on several different surfaces, feeling the difference as an operator when moving over concrete, various grades of gravel \u2013 even through sand and water. You\u2019ll also be piloting your robot over varying types of obstacles, along with testing the ability to climb at various degrees of inclination (if you\u2019re so inclined).\n\nWant to pilot using a thermal camera? Or try testing autonomous detect-and-avoid and SLAM capabilities? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t any other facility of this type in Canada,\u201d says Reece. \u201cInDro is proud to be partnering with Area X.O to bring this unique innovation to those in the aerial and ground robotics space.\u201d\n\nThe criteria for ground robots will also follow standards that are accepted for the testing of robots themselves \u2013 as well as operators.\n\nThe InDro connection\n\nInDro Robotics has a long and respected tradition of offering training to drone professionals. We have trained police, firefighters and other First Responders on how to effectively use drones within the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARS part IX) regulations. We\u2019re also fortunate to have former RCMP member Brian Fentiman \u2013 who was responsible for RCMP RPAS operations in British Columbia, on staff.\n\nIn fact, Brian created the layout for the course, and believes there are two types of clients who will want to use the test facility.\n\n\u201cI think there are going to be manufacturers that want their product tested, as well as police departments, fire departments, First Responders, as well as any professional agency that\u2019s using drones,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPart of the facility will also help other companies test ground robots \u2013 navigating curbs, driveways, inclines, sand, gravel, water and more. There\u2019s also a netted enclosure that will allow drone manufacturers to test scenarios like GPS or compass failures and flyaways. This is a safe enclosure \u2013 technically, they are flying indoors and don\u2019t have to seek special regulatory permissions or take on additional risk.\u201d\n\nBrian also points out that the facility has been designed to potentially grow over time, perhaps one day including a section for training in such areas as HUSAR \u2013 Heavy Urban Search and Rescue.\n\nFor a better idea of what the initial site will look like, check out the video below.\n\nArea X.O: A competitive advantage\n\nArea X.O is already a one-of-a-kind facility. On any given day you\u2019ll see robots taking advantage of the private roads and traffic lights used for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) testing \u2013 or drones being flown to evaluate new capabilities.\n\nThe new test centre will enhance Area X.O\u2019s capacity for testing, training, evaluation and development, in conjunction with InDro\u2019s expertise.\n\n\u201cInDro Robotics is a world leader in advanced robotic and drone R&D, and one of the very first companies in Canada to be certified by Transport Canada to fly Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS),\u201d said Kelly Daize, Strategic Market Director of Area X.O. \u201cWe are delighted that InDro is building an R&D team onsite with us at Area X.O with 20 engineers and counting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving this world leader co-located at our private R&D facility creates an immense competitive advantage for the innovators and companies we serve,\u201d said Rebecca Thompson, Senior Manager of Operations, Area X.O. \u201cWe are excited to build on our collaboration and put InDro\u2019s industry leadership, technology and certified capabilities to work to accelerate the commercialization of new robotic solutions and build the pipeline of related expertise.\u201d\n\nBelow: InDro CEO Philip Reece at Area X.O during the TCXPO event\n\nInDro\u2019s take\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to be involved with this project \u2013 which, to the best of our knowledge \u2013 is the first of its kind in Canada.\n\nWith InDro\u2019s background in both drone training and robotics R&D, we\u2019re confident this will be a perfect match for our skillset.\n\n\u201cFlying drones professionally, and operating robots, is a skill,\u201d says InDro CEO Philip Reece.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to offering our services at this facility to First Responders and professional operators from across Canada on a year-round basis. Whether it\u2019s drones or robots, we anticipate this will become the go-to site for elevating skills and testing product capabilities in a controlled environment. We\u2019re also pleased to again be collaborating with the excellent Area X.O and Invest Ottawa teams.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the new facility will begin shortly, with operations expected to commence by summer, 2023.",

            "text": "When a tyre blaze broke out at a Pilbara mine site last year, a firefighting robot helped douse the flames.\n\nIn that harsh environment, tyre fires do happen. Usually, a 300m exclusion zone is put in place for safety, which means assets are left to burn, requiring part of the mine to be shut down for 24 hours.\n\nSo when mine operator Rio Tinto approached Australian robotics company BIA5 to design and build RORI (short for Remotely Operated Rescue Initiative) this was the exact scenario they had in mind.\n\nWithin minutes of the mayday call, RORI, a red firefighting robot that looks like a small tank, was dragging a fire hose hundreds of metres up the haul road towards the burning grader. And in 15 minutes the robot was working to extinguish the fire.\n\nSeeing the robot do its job in a real-world situation was a proud moment for the company, BIA5 Managing Director Shawn Tansley tells Cosmos.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see something catch on fire. But it was kind of nice to see it all come together.\u201d\n\nWith about 10 full time employees, Queensland-based BIA5 designs and manufactures capable, all-terrain robots for a range of high-risk situations encountered in mining, research, policing and defence.\n\nRORI is a red firefighting robot that looks like a small tank / Credit: supplied by BIA5\n\nRobotics companies like BIA5 are worth an estimated $18 billion in annual revenue to the national economy. It\u2019s a sector Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic is hoping to grow with the announcement of Australia\u2019s first National Robotics Strategy due in March.\n\nWhen it comes to robotics and automation, field robotics \u2013 like RORI \u2013 is one of Australia\u2019s niche areas of expertise, according to a 2022 industry roadmap by Robotics Australia Group.\n\nBut the roadmap shows on key industry metrics Australia has some catching up to do.\n\nRobot population density \u2013 the number of industrial robots per 10,000 employees \u2013 is a standard global benchmark, measuring the take up of automation in manufacturing. Australia has 75 robots per 10,000 employees, lagging behind the world average of 113, and Singapore on 918, according to the roadmap. South Korea has 1,000 robots per 10,000 employees according to the International Federation of Robotics.\n\nCountries with higher robot population densities \u2013 Singapore, South Korea, China \u2013 all have well-articulated robotics strategies, and are actually implementing them, Robotics Australia Group chair Dr Sue Keay tells Cosmos.\n\nWhile Australia has been \u201cpretty good\u201d at organically growing its robotics industry, in many ways the sector remains \u201cimmature and fragmented\u201d, she says. A national strategy can provide better links between research, government and industry as well as guideposts to help direct the industry and harness its potential.\n\n\u201cAustralia has developed a lot of robotics, talent and technologies, but for various reasons we\u2019ve often seen that go overseas. I\u2019m very passionate about us making sure we have an environment here in Australia that encourages development of talent and technologies to happen onshore.\u201d\n\nKeay is a member of a government-appointed advisory committee led by CSIRO Chief Scientist Bronwyn Fox which is helping to guide the strategy\u2019s development, including priority areas, issues, risks and consultation.\n\nPending the release of a discussion paper, Cosmos asked local and international robotics experts to offer their opinion about what issues they hope will be addressed.\n\nDirector of Monash Robotics Group, Professor Dana Kuli\u0107 agrees that \u201cAustralia is kind of late to the game\u201d in making robotics a focus of national policy and funding support.\n\nShe tells Cosmos Australia is known for its high-quality robotics research, but \u201csometimes the translation from the academic lab to actual deployment has been the critical gap\u201d.\n\nKuli\u0107 says having custom-built funding designed to support collaboration between research and industry would be helpful.\n\n\u201cThe United States is among the most successful in this regard. There\u2019s this very close interaction between academic researchers and industry, and more flexible arrangements,\u201d she says.\n\nGet an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox.

            "text": "Jeff Bezos is known for establishing the global online retail giant Amazon.com. He was its CEO from 1994 to July 2021, when he stepped down from his role.\n\nHe became an executive chairman and sold most of his shares. Since then, his focus has been on space technology and education.\n\nOne of his crucial education programs is Future Engineer. It is a child-to-career program that trains students in computer science.\n\nHis Bezos Earth Fund program is in Canada, US, and UK. It is an education and advocacy program that promotes natural climate solutions.\n\nPractical training over theory\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education mainly focus on practical, hands-on experience training in school. Beneficiaries are trained in technical skills which prepare them for the labor market.\n\nDue to this, students under the Bezos programs only get a little time to learn text writing from the teacher and are often left wondering who can \u2018write my college paper?\u2019\n\nIt is natural because non-ending assignments hinder a student\u2019s academic progress. That is why online technology tools and innovation in how students do their assignments are highly needed.\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education also revolve around offering technical training. In all his education programs, he puts much emphasis on providing hands-on knowledge.\n\nHe argues the world is changing fast and requires learners who are changing fast. Based on his view, practical training helps students to learn fast adaptations to fast-changing scenarios.\n\nIt is a strategy used to develop interdisciplinary knowledge in students. He believes it exposes them to modern technological developments. That is one of the reasons his programs mainly focus on computer science.\n\nHe believes computer science helps learners become problem solvers. It supports the development of essential interpersonal skills.\n\nCoding is one of the main areas of knowledge beneficiaries learn. It is essential for working in many fields, such as aerospace and robotics.\n\nThey are the main areas Bezos wants to invest in to grow future technologies. He believes robotics will transform Amazon and space science.\n\nConquering space and investing in education\n\nJeff Bezos is determined to conquer space and invest in education. He seeks to build machines transporting people to the moon and mars.\n\nHe expects to achieve this through his space science company Blue Origin. Plans are underway to launch a private space station by 2030.\n\nHis views drive him to invest much of his wealth in promoting early childhood education. In October 2020, he hinted he would spend $2 billion on Day One Fund.\n\nIt aims to help needy families get shelter, food, and total education scholarships.\n\nThe scholarships will be channeled through Montessori-inspired pre-schools. Beneficiaries are already learning free of charge. It is a year-round program targeting children of ages 3-5 years.\n\nJeff Bezos plans to spend nearly all his wealth on education and space exploration.\n\nTheoretical education is based on scoring high grades.\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education do not favor theoretical training. He believes it is disadvantaged because it is more about grades. If students fail to score high, they are seen as failures and untalented.\n\nTheoretical training does not help a student understand how to apply the knowledge in the real world. They may perform perfectly on books but poorly in the job market.\n\nThe training takes a long time to complete, yet it bears fewer fruits. It only produces a large amount of text that eventually becomes unmanageable.\n\nPractical training offers tangible evidence to students. Jeff Bezos runs several educational programs to meet his vision for practical training.\n\nThe Future Engineer childhood-to-career program\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s views on education are based on the belief that how people learn shapes what they become.\n\nHis Future Engineer childhood-to-career program targets children and young adults.\n\nThe program provides access to computer science education to needy students.\n\nThey learn coding and other computer courses that prepare them for the career market.\n\nBezo scholars \u2013 Harnessing youth power and leadership\n\nTo understand Jeff Bezos\u2019s educational views, you must understand the Bezo Scholars program. Its idea was born in 2005 during the Aspen Ideas Festival. The festival brought together leaders from around the earth.\n\nIts founders, Jackie, and Mike Bezos, had attended the festival. They wondered why there was no youth. The program offers youth leadership development knowledge.\n\nIt targets youth from North America and Africa regions. It runs for one year and prepares students to make a difference in their communities. Each year, the program targets 17 exceptional youth who receive free full-year training.\n\nThey learn how to solve urgent problems and become competent leaders in society.\n\nMontessori style pre-schools\n\nThe schools target young children and offer free education. Bezos has built the schools and hired teachers and administrators. Many of the workers in the pre-schools are former Amazon employees.\n\nThe target beneficiaries are children from needy families. The education style is based on self-directed activities. Children get hands-on learning plus collaborative play.\n\nThey learn under highly trained educators who guide them based on their age.\n\nConclusion\n\nAbout two years ago, Jeff Bezos resigned as Amazon.com CEO. Since then, he has been focused on conquering space and investing in education. Bezos plans to spend almost all of his wealth on space exploration and education.\n\nHis views on education are that education should be practical based. It is what prepares students to become problem solvers. He is currently running several education programs as part of his vision.",

            "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Space Force is a year behind on its most recent effort to fully decommission its legacy space object catalog and replace it with a modernized command and control capability designed to track space launches and monitor on-orbit debris.\n\nThe service had expected to replace its 1970s-era Space Defense Operations Center, known as SPADOC, by the end of 2022 with a new Space Command and Control system designed to improve the its ability to analyze, process and deliver data from its network of ground and space-based sensors that track on-orbit activity. But Col. Chris Kadala, senior materiel leader for operational command and control, told C4ISRNET the new capability won\u2019t be ready until late this year.\n\n\u201cThe timeline for the delivery of capability sufficient to decommission the SPADOC system has moved from the end of 2022 to no earlier than [the] fourth quarter [of] calendar year 2023,\u201d Kadala said in a Jan. 27 email.\n\nThe Space C2 system is comprised of several hardware and software development efforts, and the transition from SPADOC to the more modernized architecture is dependent on the initial delivery of a data processing and analysis tool called the Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System. The program will deliver additional capability over time, but its baseline requirements are meant to replace the legacy system\u2019s functionality.\n\nThe Space Force awarded L3Harris a $53 million contract in 2018 to develop ATLAS and in 2022 issued a $49 million follow-on contract to continue development. The company did not respond by press time to a request for comment.\n\nIn a Feb. 1 interview, the program\u2019s Materiel Leader Lt. Col. Edward Jones said the delay in delivering ATLAS is largely due to systems engineering challenges. Because the broader Space C2 program is made up of multiple capabilities, the program team had been focused in different areas rather than on the goal of completing the SPADOC transition.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of different capability, we have a requirements set that\u2019s very broad,\u201d Jones told C4ISRNET. \u201cThat allows us to do whatever is needed. Unfortunately, that can sometimes cause delays. If you have infinite scope, you can sometimes get distracted with doing lower priority things.\u201d\n\nThe setback follows a series of SPADOC modernization attempts that date back as far as the 1980s. The service has fielded some upgrades in that time, but most did not deliver on original capability, cost and schedule estimates. The most recent effort, the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System, was designed in 2009 to field in three phases. The program ultimately fielded only one of those increments, and the Air Force halted development in 2018 due to a three-year schedule delay and a $139 million cost overage.\n\nJones said the service\u2019s many failed attempts to develop a new space command and control capability are evidence of the difficulty that comes with replacing a system that was designed to manage a much smaller amount of data than what the Space Force captures today through the radars and sensors that make up its Space Surveillance Network.\n\n\u201cThis is a really tough challenge,\u201d Jones said. \u201cFolks have been trying to decommission SPADOC for a couple of decades now. The catalog has doubled in the last few years, the number of launches are growing exponentially, the number of payloads that are coming off of those rockets . . .there\u2019s just a lot more to track.\u201d\n\n\u2018Long-standing troubled programs\u2019\n\nThat growing catalog of space objects and the increased activity in space makes fielding a more modern and capable system even more important to Space Force leadership. Frank Calvelli, the service\u2019s top acquisition executive, labeled ATLAS as one of the service\u2019s \u201clong-standing troubled programs\u201d during a Jan. 24 speech at the National Security Space Association conference. Delivering the capability in 2023 is a top priority for the service, he said.\n\nLt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, told reporters Jan. 24 that SPACECOM operators -- who will benefit from ATLAS -- are ready to have the more automated capability on hand.\n\n\u201cATLAS is the next generation of capability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll help us do our job better and more efficiently, so we just want that capability.\u201d\n\nThe Space C2 program has implemented some changes to get after the management and technical issues and stick to its goal of delivering ATLAS by the end of the year, Jones said. Last spring, the program established a systems engineering and integration team to help define the requirements and make a plan for transitioning off of SPADOC. It also shifted personnel from other parts of the program to focus on ATLAS.\n\nThe program has also begun operational testing, which it\u2019s completing in increments. The first of those test events occurred in November, and the second is happening this month. The service has submitted a test plan to the Pentagon\u2019s director of operational test and evaluation and expects that to be approved by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty proud of the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think we are very wide eyed in terms of how much determination and grit across all of our teams this is going to take. And we\u2019re relying on that right now.\u201d\n\nCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET\u2019s space and emerging technology reporter.

            "text": "The past few decades have witnessed the largest changes to the space industry since the Cold War. Between Sputnik 1 and SpaceX Falcon 9, we have seen more nations establish their own defensive space commands, diversify space technologies, and even demonstrate destructive capabilities for the world to see.\n\nSpace exploration is no longer a domain reserved for wealthy nations, nor is it the exclusive club it once was, as private companies have earned a seat at the table. Today, there are 90 nations operating in space, and about 10,000 firms and 5,000 investors are involved in the space industry. Billionaires\u2014including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson\u2014at the helms of companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, among others, are launching their own rockets, spacecraft, and satellite constellations and disrupting a market long dominated by giant defense contractors and government agencies.\n\nThe world is undergoing a space renaissance\u2014a period when seismic innovations in technology are powering new capabilities\u2014including advances in the manufacture, propulsion, and launch of space systems. Not only have these changes made it possible for the private sector to explore space and conduct more targeted missions; they have also made these activities more accessible and affordable, giving rise to start-ups and encouraging established aerospace companies to pursue innovative projects that were previously deemed too costly or risky. Private funding has also increased over the past five years\u2014a signal that the industry is attracting attention from investors.\n\nSpace has matured into a domain driven by a greater number of players\u2014be it nations, private entities, or nontraditional participants\u2014and we no longer need a telescope to see the vital importance of the \u201cfinal frontier\u201d as a global economic driver. Despite the possibilities that this new space age will bring in the coming years, few are aware of the extent to which the space economy is already reshaping how people live and work, and more important, how governments compete for power and influence.\n\nSince the launch of the first artificial satellite, to the first manned spaceflight, to the first moonwalk, space has long served as a global hub for innovation, pushing the boundaries of the known to expand scientific and technical knowledge.\n\nAs the commercial space age progresses, the potential for new space applications is promising. Their projected viability will multiply if established aerospace giants like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon increasingly collaborate with smaller firms that are relatively new to space exploration. One example is the partnership between the satellite start-up Omnispace and Lockheed Martin to develop 5G capability from space.\n\nIn the future, the International Space Station will no longer be one of the only access points to microgravity research, because its successor (or successors) will be commercially built. NASA would be just one customer of future commercial space stations, alongside other tenants\u2014both private and government contributors\u2014with aspirations to establish research labs and study various applications of space across industries. Whether it be pharmaceutical companies studying cell growth or tech companies testing manufacturing in microgravity, concepts that may have been perceived as fantasy not long ago will inevitably affect, if not become commonplace among, most sectors.\n\nCoupled with the global impact of widespread digital transformation, as big data and artificial intelligence enable a greater number of sectors to operate with increased efficiency, the space renaissance leaves many questions unanswered. But one thing is clear: governments that explore how to capitalize on increased commercial access to space, which emerging applications to pursue, and which sectors will hold the most promise in this relatively nascent industry could gain a long-term, strategic economic advantage over competing nations. The United States must act now to avoid being left behind in this domain that it so proudly pioneered.\n\nA New Age of Investment\n\nGovernment agencies\u2014particularly NASA, the US Department of Defense, and the intelligence community\u2014have long held the purse strings to space investment, as supported by the 18 percent increase in US government\u2013funded space ventures last year. According to a Space Foundation report, this is a trend we are seeing in the US and around the world. There was a 19 percent jump in overall international government spending on military and civilian space programs last year; India increased its spending by 36 percent, while China\u2019s investments increased by 23 percent.\n\nThough it\u2019s clear that government agencies will continue to make substantial contributions to the space sector for some time, increasingly affordable costs and technological advancements are making space appealing to a greater number of special-purpose acquisition companies and individual investors, effectively stimulating more innovation. In 2021, the space economy was valued at $469 billion, up 9 percent from 2020, and private-sector investment in space companies exceeded $10 billion. Notably, commercial R&D spending within the space sector has risen by 22 percent annually over the past five years\u2014more than double the US government's 10 percent increase in R&D funding. It\u2019s also worth noting that from 2010 to 2018, US budget allocations for international space R&D have dropped from 70 percent to about 50 percent, and annual funding for privately owned space start-ups more than doubled, despite taking a hit in 2022.\n\nEven though US government R&D spending\u2014about $12 billion a year\u2014continues to outweigh the roughly $6 billion from commercial R&D, there is a real possibility that commercial actors will overtake government funding sources within the next two decades. This could bolster public\u2013private partnership models\u2014a scenario that lends itself well to shifting US priorities in space.\n\nThe Benefits of the Space Economy\n\nSince the launch of the first artificial satellite, to the first manned spaceflight, to the first moonwalk, space has long served as a global hub for innovation, pushing the boundaries of the known to expand scientific and technical knowledge. If not for the \u201cSpace Race,\u201d essential systems such as communications, air transport, maritime trade, financial services, weather monitoring, and defense, which all rely heavily on space-based assets for their daily functioning, would be nowhere near as advanced as they are today. Comparing the market share of space services in the 1960s\u2014when space was largely occupied by governments and telecommunications firms\u2014with that of today, we can see how the democratization of space, and subsequent investments in space exploration, have enabled the development of much of the modern world\u2019s critical infrastructure. But satellite technology laid the groundwork for\u2014and has delivered the most value to\u2014the space economy since the USSR launched Sputnik in 1957.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with a payload a of Starlink satellites for a high-speed low earth orbit internet constellation, lifts off from launch complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Sunday, July 17, 2022. AP Photo/John Raoux.\n\nThe role that satellites play in the day-to-day operations of large corporations is often ignored. Satellites are the backbone of all other functions; without them, inventory monitoring at distant warehouse locations, authorizing credit card transactions in real time, and international videoconferencing would be all but impossible. For the everyday consumer, satellite technology is used to open maps, connect to Wi-Fi, or watch our favorite shows on streaming platforms. Although satellite-enabled internet isn\u2019t quite ready to displace the service provided by cell towers and fiber optic cables, it plays a significant role in the broader networks that millions of people use every day, adding more capacity to existing resources and extending coverage. T-Mobile, for instance, is planning to use Starlink\u2019s network to expand its coverage in rural areas without cell phone towers, and Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper will bolster Verizon\u2019s 4G, LTE, and 5G networks.\n\nIn just over three years since launching the first Starlink satellite constellation, the company now has launched more than 3,500 satellites, and over 1 million customers are paying for its network.\n\nSatellites also allow world leaders to address pressing geopolitical and economic challenges as well as social and economic ones. Governments often collaborate with private companies to obtain satellite images and data that provide valuable intelligence, including information on the movement of troops and the installation of weapons systems \u2013 capabilities far more advanced than those available during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In Ukraine, commercial satellite data are providing a bird\u2019s-eye view of the conflict like never before, allowing the world to witness and record events on the ground as they happen. This influence is spreading, too: with geopolitical tensions high in East Asia, and inspired by Starlink\u2019s role in Ukraine\u2019s mounting defense against Russia, Taiwan is actively looking for investors to fund its own domestic satellite network.\n\nNovel Terrestrial and Space Applications\n\nSatellite technology is rapidly advancing, with many companies now deploying smaller and less expensive satellites in low Earth orbit\u2014an altitude of 2,000 kilometers or less. Over the past five to ten years, there has been a significant shift toward using low Earth orbit for satellite broadband connectivity, away from higher elevations, which often have spotty connection due to the large distance between the satellite and the receiver. In our increasingly connected society, a lack of access to high-speed, low-latency internet\u2014let alone broadband internet\u2014is suboptimal and deepens the divide between the connected and the underconnected.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Starlink has championed the effort to mitigate these types of issues by revolutionizing satellite broadband internet and leveraging low Earth orbit for high-bandwidth, low-latency communications, where more data can be sent and received with little to no delays or lags in time. In just over three years since launching the first Starlink satellite constellation in 2019, the company has now launched more than 3,500 satellites, and over 1 million customers are paying for its network. Despite delays and challenges, OneWeb and Amazon's Project Kuiper are both planning to deploy their own low Earth orbit constellations in the near future, which will further work to bridge the digital divide. On top of these developments in satellite connectivity, new uses could also arise from improvements in satellite imaging\u2014used for mapping, managing disaster response, environmental conservation efforts, and many other applications\u2014in turn creating opportunities for more precise and accurate data collection for future applications.\n\nAs commercial space becomes increasingly pervasive, extending access to the final frontier to anyone that can pay for their goods and services, the new space economy will level great power rivalries and global economic competition.\n\nAside from the terrestrial applications of advancements in space technology, novel applications in space are now also possible due to more frequent, low-cost launches, and the increasing financial viability of long-term missions. A few areas to watch include:\n\nResearch and development\n\nSpace R&D has been an area of interest for some time, but non-aerospace businesses have been hesitant to invest in extensive projects. This could change in the near future. With the International Space Station scheduled to retire in 2031, private space companies are preparing to embark on new journeys for scientific research in space, journeys they are betting will be cost-effective and hold high return on investment as the market for them grows.\n\nInternational space station on orbit of Earth planet. Elements of this image furnished by NASA. Shutterstock/Dima Zel.\n\nPharmaceutical firms, for example, could use the environment to cultivate cell cultures to better predict disease models or to discover complex molecules, which grow differently in microgravity when compared with the structured patterns of growth on Earth. And as humans prepare to venture deeper into space, including potential missions to Mars, research outside Earth\u2019s protective magnetic field and atmosphere will be critical to understanding and mitigating the risks of low gravity and radiation on space travelers\u2019 bodies.\n\nCompanies producing consumer goods may also want to use the space environment to their advantage to improve design and production processes. Conditions such as high radiation levels, near-vacuum-like conditions, and microgravity could make testing and subsequently manufacturing superior products a not-so-distant reality.\n\nSatellite servicing: the space economy\u2019s foundation\n\nThe same technologies that enable satellite servicing could lower the costs of manufacturing goods such as larger satellites, telescopes, space stations, space factories, and storage facilities, while simultaneously addressing current needs. These technologies also could bring prospective businesses, such as space mining and resource extraction, one step closer to realization. As such, building out satellite-servicing capabilities is the first step in advancing manufacturing, construction, and assembly in space. The key here will be building the capacity for heavier launch vehicles so larger payloads can be transported into space.\n\nOne fascinating company paving the way in applied robotics and manufacturing is Florida-based Made in Space, Inc. Through the use of microgravity-enabled 3D printers, this firm has been able to provide next-generation manufacturing capabilities aboard the International Space Station, such as 3D-printed optical fibers and ceramic turbine parts. These types of projects support exploration objectives and national security priorities, and they demonstrate the immense potential for new markets to spur commercial activity in low Earth orbit.\n\n(Back) to the moon\u2014and beyond\n\nWith the successful launch of NASA\u2019s Artemis 1 spacecraft on November 16, 2022, it is safe to say that the revival of American space exploration is well under way. The Artemis II mission will bring humans along to orbit the lunar sphere and pave the way for Artemis III, a potential 2025 mission that may result in a 21st-century moonwalk. These are the first steps in NASA\u2019s Artemis Odyssey, whose ultimate goal is to conduct the first human missions to Mars in the near future.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, NASA's Moon to Mars campaign, which includes the Artemis program, generated nearly $2.2 billion in tax revenue, contributed nearly a third of NASA\u2019s $71.2 billion in economic impact, and supported 93,700 jobs nationwide. In addition to providing scientific returns, showing geopolitical leadership, and demonstrating the enduring value of human and robotic space exploration, the program will continue to deliver substantial economic growth and enhance the United States\u2019 competitiveness.\n\nAlthough activities in space tourism are currently limited, the sector is expected to grow far beyond the current suborbital rides to space aboard Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo and Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have even marketed their ambitions beyond the moon as a way to help humanity\u2014by creating a city on Mars or by building colonies in Earth\u2019s orbit, where large numbers of people could live and work in space. Improvements in technology, including satellite servicing, laser communication between satellites, and edge computing, could significantly boost the development and viability of such projects even further.\n\nSpace: Ripe for Revised Governance\n\nThe increased accessibility and lower costs of space exploration have opened the door for numerous industries to explore and create innovative applications. Some comparisons have even been made between where space exploration is headed and the early days of the internet, when businesses quickly moved to capitalize on its potential.\n\nAs commercial space becomes increasingly pervasive, extending access to the final frontier to anyone that can pay for their goods and services, the new space economy will level great power rivalries and global economic competition. Although this dynamic is already present in the global economy, many countries considered to be further behind in space exploration\u2014including the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and South Korea, among others\u2014may well be able to compete with the established space programs of the US, Russia, China, and India by the end of the decade. Take the Emirates, for instance, who in February 2021 (less than a decade after the nation\u2019s space program was created), triumphantly sent its \u201cHope\u201d probe into Martian orbit and became only the fifth nation\u2014after the US, Russia, China, and India\u2014to reach Mars. Even more notably, it only took the Emirates one attempt.\n\nThese types of changes could alter the state of security competition while also boosting the global economy. Despite the challenges that come with space exploration, its potential is immense, and commercial actors\u2014as well as the nation states that have a stake in them\u2014that do not recognize this may find themselves lagging behind. Meanwhile, the rules, competitive practices, and norms that have developed for the internet and the aviation industry can serve as models for how the governance of space could emerge and evolve in the not-so-distant future.\n\nSophie Goguichvili is a program associate with the Wilson Center's Science Technology and Innovation Program, working on space and artificial intelligence policy.

            "text": "End users are looking to machine builders to provide innovative solutions that improve upon the speed and accuracy of manual-based applications while maintaining the same level of flexibility. Improving Materials Processing With Robotics Alex Bonaire, Product Manager - Robotic | Omron Automation\n\nOperations in industries like food and commodity, waste processing, and agriculture often involve processing and/or packaging materials at extremely fast rates. End users are looking to machine builders to provide innovative solutions that improve upon the speed and accuracy of manual-based applications while maintaining the same level of flexibility. For solutions using fixed machinery, speed and accuracy may not be as pressing an issue, but flexibility often leaves much to be desired.\n\nRobots can readily address these concerns. That being true, many professionals in these industries hold on to beliefs that robots are difficult to use, overly expensive relative to their ROI, and unable to address complicated and/or unstructured applications. However, today\u2019s robotic technology makes the above assertions no longer valid.\n\nTypical challenges in pick-and-place applications\n\nToday\u2019s high-speed pick-and-place applications often have parts or product coming by on a conveyor belt that never stops moving. In some cases, such as is commonly the case in food and beverage packaging, there may be multiple product types that need to be packaged together into the same box in varying assortments. The configuration of these assortments may change daily depending on the number of varieties offered by the manufacturer, and new ones are often needed to adapt to market pressures.\n\nWhen fixed machinery is used, the system might not adapt well to any changes to a product or assortment. Oftentimes, separate machines are required to process the full range of products, a costly strategy both in terms of financial expenses and floor space. Frequently, when a particular product configuration is being processed, the machinery used for the other varieties will lie dormant. When machinery does offer flexibility, it is typically a very complex mechanical system that has numerous failure points and requires an extended changeover period while operators swap out parts and adjust it to run the next variant.\n\nIn situations that use manual sorting instead of fixed machinery, a pick-and-place application would involve a (potentially quite large) team of people standing next to the conveyor belts, picking things off the line, and sorting them into boxes. Since this type of work is quite mind-numbing and has some potential for repetitive motion injuries, it leads to low employee satisfaction and high turnover. Given today\u2019s labor shortage, the pressures of keeping these applications fully staffed become too high.\n\nRobots\u2019 flexibility, speed, and accuracy makes them ideal for fast-paced pick-and-place\n\nThe benefits of robots in and of themselves are significant by their ability to integrate seamlessly with a variety of other automation technologies. As compared with having employees perform pick-and-place tasks manually, robots have significant advantages in terms of speed, accuracy, and the ability to work round-the-clock. When a conveyor is going at high speeds, human workers may have difficulty keeping up, and may begin to make mistakes as a result.\n\nFurthermore, the monotony of a particular task \u2014 or its unsavory aspects, such as handling dirty or otherwise unsavory material (like unwashed produce, greasy or sharp components, and even waste items) \u2014 matters little to a robot, whereas human workers would see this as a reason to start looking for a new job immediately. Many robots are also designed to be immune to harsh environments that would be quite difficult \u2014 and potentially hazardous \u2014 for people to work in. Overall, robots provide labor-related benefits such as nonstop operation, reduced labor turnover, and the reduction or elimination of work related injuries.\n\nRobots can easily adapt to a new product design or configuration with very simple, quick programming changes. For example, once the robot system is set up, users can easily switch from one program to another with the touch of a button, and the robot automatically switches from processing variant \u201cA\u201d to variant \u201cF.\u201d When a new variant is needed, the modular process architecture of the software lets users quickly reconfigure the entire pick-and-place process without writing code or creating new programs.\n\nRobots have unique capabilities when integrated with other automation technologies\n\nRobots by themselves are highly flexible additions to any production line. However, when paired with other technologies, their benefits are compounded. Ultimately, robots can function as part of a fully integrated, factory-wide solution that incorporates machine vision, traceability, servo motion, and safety.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious technology to pair with a robot is a vision system. Powerful machine vision allows robots to quickly recognize and categorize products. In tandem with pick-and place, a vision system not only enables the robot to locate a part in space (even while in motion) without the need for a fixed location, but it can also perform inspections to detect any product defects and prompt the robot to place faulty items in a discard bin.\n\nVision systems can also take care of traceability needs by capturing the barcodes placed on individual products and making sure that all components of an assortment are present. Additionally, in dynamic applications like those when robots need to pick from moving conveyors, vision systems can help the robot maximize its pick rate by indicating which parts are most optimally positioned to pick next.\n\nRobots are capable of high-speed motion with very fast cycle times, but some applications have such high throughput requirements that even the fastest robot would not be able to keep up. Such applications can benefit from multiple robots working together to share the load. If a combo box-packing application is designed to have such high throughput that a single robot cannot manage all the items, a second robot can capture the items missed by the first one. More robots mean that more items can be processed in your application and strategic positioning of the robots can be implemented to optimize the pick process and/or increase flexibility. Furthermore, robots can share information between themselves to not only to ensure that all items are picked but can also balance the workload so that each robot is processing an equal number of items.\n\nIntegrate Parallel robot with the rest of the factory automation technologies and controlled altogether on a single programmable logic controller (PLC) provides several advantages. For instance, if the conveyor is controlled by the same PLC, the robots can dynamically adjust conveyor speed to adapt to product flow and/or stop the conveyor if the need arises to ensure all items are picked. If the conveyor is servo driven, its motion can be synced in real time with the robots so that these technologies dynamically adjust their own motion based on changes to throughput and with micrometer precision.\n\nEnd users looking to move beyond manual or fixed-machinery solutions for high-speed pick and-place can benefit greatly from the speed, precision, and flexibility of robots, especially from robots that are designed to achieve exceptionally high speeds with high levels of stability. When integrated with other automation technologies as part of a connected factory, today\u2019s most advanced robotic solutions can communicate directly with vision systems, conveyors, and other devices to autonomously respond to changing throughput and configuration needs.\n\nThe content & opinions in this article are the author\u2019s and do not necessarily represent the views of RoboticsTomorrow\n\nOmron Automation Omron is an industrial automation partner that creates, sells and services fully integrated automation solutions that include robotics, sensing, motion, logic, safety, and more for manufacturers in the automotive, semiconductor, food and beverage packaging and other industries.
