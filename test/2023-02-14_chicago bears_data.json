            "text": "I\u2019ve said it before and don\u2019t mind repeating it. If Tee Higgins hits the market, the Bears *MUST* pick up the phone. We might not know for some time if Higgins ends up as trade bait this offseason. A certain amount of dominos need to fall in order for that to happen. But it is something we should continue keeping an eye on as this season rolls around.\n\nSure, it seems like a long shot. But it isn\u2019t wholly unrealistic.\n\nHiggins making it to the trade market comes up in a conversation with long-time NFL insider Peter King and NBC Sports Chicago Bears reporter Josh Schrock. Yeah, this one is a doozy:\n\nThe interview is 14+ minutes. And it tackles a variety of other topics. King explains why the Bears would be foolish to trade Justin Fields. The long-time NFL reporter also gave GM Ryan Poles a vote of confidence when it comes to roster construction, sharing his belief the Bears will aggressively go after offensive linemen and receivers this offseason. Which brings us back to Higgins.\n\nKing mentions Higgins as a potential Bears target, but there are some \u201cbuts\u201d we must discuss.\n\nFirstly, King doesn\u2019t believe the Bengals want to trade Higgins. And I can\u2019t say I blame them. I mean, you\u2019ve seen Higgins play ball, right? Higgins is coming off his second straight season with exactly 74 catches, at least six touchdown receptions, and more than 1,000 receiving yards. No team in their right mind should want to trade a player like Higgins. However, King surmises the Bengals might not have a choice in the matter. After all, Cincy has to extend quarterback Joe Burrow this offseason and wideout Ja\u2019Marr Chase after next offseason. And because King doesn\u2019t think the Bengals can pay Burrow and extend Higgins, that would be a step toward Cincy trying to cut a deal. Maybe they\u2019ll see what the Chiefs did in winning a Super Bowl after trading Tyreek Hill and see it as inspiration. In any case, it is something I\u2019m watching for this offseason.\n\nEven more so after hearing Higgins\u2019 name come up in discussion with Justin Fields during Super Bowl week while chopping it up with USA Today\u2019s Mackenzie Salmon.\n\nHere is the exchange that piques my interest:\n\nMackenzie Salmon: \u201cI know there were trade rumors for Tee Higgins. What do you think that would be like?\u201d\n\nJustin Fields: \u201cThat would be awesome. So, we\u2019re actually part of the same agency. So I get to see him work out in the offseason once every year. He\u2019s a great player. Great size, great receiver, and he\u2019s just really smooth. Of course the things he can do on the outside with the jump balls and the route running. He\u2019s a great player for sure.\u201d\n\nHey, now! If Fields wants to use that connection and guide Higgins to Chicago, then by all means I\u2019m all for it. Nothing says \u201cthe Chicago way\u201d like some behind-the-scenes greasing of the skids. Whatever it takes, am I right?\n\nYou can watch more of the interview with Fields here:\n\nAgain, it is worth repeating: You\u2019ve gotta try to get Higgins if he makes it to the market. Pick up the phone and make the call. Whether the Bengals answer or even show a willingness to do business is irrelevant. The Bears have to go about upgrading their receivers\u2019 room with a mindset that is equal parts aggressive and progressive. WR1s don\u2019t just land in your lap, so there is an expectation that the Bears will need to get creative this offseason to get their guy. It could be Higgins. Or maybe someone else. Whatever. Just get out there and try. Shoot for the moon and whatnot. What\u2019s the worst thing that can happen? The Bengals say no? Ha.\n\nIn any case, I doubt this is the last we\u2019ll hear of Higgins and the Bears this offseason.",

            "text": "Fans of 30 other teams that didn\u2019t play in a Super Bowl always find it hard to watch the game itself. They have no idea how difficult it is for the players of those teams. These are guys that pour hundreds of hours into this sport. All of it is meant to get them to a Super Bowl and win that Lombardi trophy. Chicago Bears fans have had it pretty bad for a long time. Their team hasn\u2019t won a Super Bowl in almost 40 years now. The one time they made it there in 2006 ended in defeat. The team hasn\u2019t even won a playoff game in 13 years. Jaquan Brisker doesn\u2019t like that.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rookie safety has already developed a reputation for being outspoken. He isn\u2019t afraid to make bold proclamations, calling himself the steal of the draft when the Bears called him last April. There is nothing wrong with that. His self-confidence is well-founded since he was one of the best players on defense for most of the year. However, it\u2019s not the individual success he cares about. Brisker wants to win. He wants a championship. So the day after the Super Bowl, he had an announcement to make.\n\nEnjoy it now, cuz we on the way. #Chicago \u2014 Quanny B. (@JaquanBrisker) February 14, 2023\n\nJaquan Brisker can sense what is coming.\n\nThe Bears had the worst record in the NFL this past season, but they were close in so many games. This off-season will be spent bringing in reinforcements on both sides of the ball. If GM Ryan Poles handles his resources well, this could be a much better football team by opening day in September. This comes at the same time as several rookies from the 2022 draft class will have a chance to build on what they accomplished. Kyler Gordon had three interceptions. Braxton Jones started every game at left tackle. Velus Jones became a standout kick returner.\n\nThen there is Jaquan Brisker himself. It didn\u2019t take him long to become a factor on the Bears\u2019 defense. He was the draft pick that transitioned the fastest. Both scouts and coaches feel he might end up being the best player in the class. The key will be getting help around him, especially up front. That will come in the following months. Brisker has athleticism. He has the instincts. Now he\u2019s growing his leadership. He believes the wins are coming. It\u2019s hard not to believe him.",

            "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Patrick Mahomes shook off an ankle injury, turned back into a magician and pulled out another comeback on the biggest stage to help the Kansas City Chiefs win their second Super Bowl in four years.\n\nMahomes threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and scrambled 26 yards on the go-ahead drive before Harrison Butker kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left to give the Chiefs a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the MVP,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said about Mahomes. \u201cThat\u2019s all that needs to be said. MVP. And you saw it tonight.\u201d\n\nMahomes and Jalen Hurts excelled in the first Super Bowl matchup featuring two Black starting quarterbacks. But Mahomes, the two-time AP NFL MVP, turned it up in the second half after aggravating a sprained right ankle. He earned his second Super Bowl MVP award too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt took everybody to win the games. We\u2019re Super Bowl champs, baby,\u201d Mahomes shouted on stage as red and yellow confetti littered the field.\n\nReid, who couldn\u2019t win the big game in Philadelphia, beat his former team to earn his second ring with Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get this so bad for him,\u201d Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said. \u201cHis legacy in Philly lives on forever. I know that city loves him. I know that the organization loves him.\n\n\u201cBut ever since he\u2019s been here in Kansas City \u2014 I\u2019ve seen it firsthand \u2014 he poured his heart and his mind and his soul into this organization, into this team and led a group of men. ... There\u2019s a lot of pride in knowing that he\u2019s had success in two different organizations, but this was the better one.\u201d\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid, right, and Travis Kelce celebrate their Super Bowl win Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, in Glendale, Ariz. (Matt Slocum/AP)\n\nWith the score tied at 35, the Eagles tried to let the Chiefs score a touchdown with less than two minutes left so they could get the ball back after a defensive holding call on cornerback James Bradberry on third-and-8 gave Kansas City a first down. But Jerick McKinnon slid at the 2, forcing the Eagles to use their last timeout.\n\n\u201cIt was a holding,\u201d Bradberry said. \u201cI tugged his jersey. I was hoping they would let it slide.\u201d\n\nAfter Mahomes took a knee twice, Butker nailed his kick, sending thousands of red-clad Chiefs fans into a frenzy.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing just to see the confetti,\u201d said Butker, who missed a 42-yarder in the first quarter. \u201cI just tried to focus on one kick and focusing on the process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chiefs won their second Super Bowl after the 2019 season, 50 years after the first one. It took just three years to get another Lombardi Trophy.\n\nChiefs fans were outnumbered in the stadium, but they did their part to silence the boisterous Philly fans with the tomahawk chop chant.\n\nDown 24-14 with a limping Mahomes, the Chiefs followed up Rihanna\u2019s electrifying halftime performance with a sensational offensive outburst.\n\n\u201cEverybody had that determination, that look in their eye,\u201d Kelce said.\n\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes celebrates with wide receiver Kadarius Toney after Toney hauled in a touchdown pass in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LVII on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, in Glendale, Ariz. (Nick Wagner/The Kansas City Star/TNS)\n\nMahomes, who suffered a high ankle sprain in the divisional round, hurt it again on a 3-yard scramble late in the second quarter. He limped off the field but showed no ill effects on Kansas City\u2019s next possession.\n\nMahomes slipped in the pocket \u2014 several players lost their footing on the natural grass surface \u2014 yet somehow regained his balance and scrambled 14 yards to the Eagles 4, setting up Isiah Pacheco\u2019s 1-yard touchdown run that cut the deficit to 24-21.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Jake Elliott\u2019s 33-yard field goal extended Philadelphia\u2019s lead to 27-21, the Chiefs struck again.\n\nMahomes tossed a 5-yard TD pass to a wide-open Kardarius Toney to give Kansas City its first lead at 28-27 early in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Chiefs tightened up their defense, forcing Philly to punt. Then Toney returned a line-drive kick 65 yards to the Eagles 5 for the longest punt return in Super Bowl history.\n\nOn third down from the 4, Mahomes connected with Skyy Moore to extend the lead to 35-27. Moore also was wide open on the play.\n\nBut the Eagles wouldn\u2019t go away.\n\nHurts hit DeVonta Smith for a 46-yard gain to the Chiefs 2 and ran in for his third score of the game. He also ran in for the 2-point conversion to tie it at 35-35 with 5:15 to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs \u201cFly! Eagles! Fly!\u201d reverberated throughout the stadium, Mahomes and the Chiefs went back to work.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) walks off the field after their loss to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, in Glendale, Ariz. (Ross D. Franklin/AP)\n\nThe 27-year-old Mahomes became the third player to win his second NFL MVP award before age 28. He also became the youngest quarterback to start three Super Bowls. Then Mahomes became the first player to win the Super Bowl the same season he was MVP after nine straight players lost.\n\nJust five years after winning the first Super Bowl in franchise history, the Eagles came close with a different coach and quarterback. Nick Sirianni replaced Doug Pederson in 2021, and Hurts took over for Carson Wentz in late 2020.\n\nHurts set a Super Bowl record for a quarterback with 70 rushing yards and tied a record with three rushing scores. He also threw for 304 yards and one touchdown.\n\nThe Eagles marched 75 yards down the field on the opening possession, with Hurts scoring from the 1 for a 7-0 lead, and controlled the ball for almost 22 minutes in the first half.\n\nHurts, who missed two games late in the season with a shoulder injury, had no trouble throwing a perfect deep ball to A.J. Brown, giving the Eagles a 14-7 lead with a 45-yard connection on the first play of the second quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Hurts made a rare mistake on the next drive when he fumbled without being hit while scrambling away from pressure. Nick Bolton picked it up and raced 36 yards for a score that made it 14-14. Hurts had just eight turnovers this season: six picks and two fumbles.\n\nUndeterred, Hurts kept running.\n\nHe took off for 14 yards on the first play after the fumble. On fourth-and-5 from the Chiefs 44, Hurts ran for 28 yards. He finished off the drive with a 4-yard TD run to put Philadelphia ahead 21-14.\n\nElliott kicked a 35-yard field goal to send the Eagles into halftime leading 24-14.\n\nMahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three touchdowns and no turnovers. He ran for 44 yards.\n\nHe connected with Kelce on an 18-yard TD pass in the right corner to tie it at 7-7 in the first quarter. The Chiefs\u2019 All-Pro tight end and Eagles All-Pro center Jason Kelce became the first set of brothers to play against each other in the Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce, left, and quarterback Patrick Mahomes hold the Vince Lombardi Trophy after their Super Bowl victory against the Eagles on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, in Glendale, Ariz. (Marcio J. Sanchez/AP)\n\nTheir mom, Donna Kelce, wore a half-red, half-green jersey with No. 87 on the front for Travis and No. 62 on the back for Jason. She sat in a suite between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin.\n\nEagles fans turned State Farm Stadium into a sea of green, chanting \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S!\u201d and singing the team\u2019s fight song after each score. But they left disappointed.\n\nReid won more games than any coach in team history during 14 seasons with the Eagles, but the one knock against him was he couldn\u2019t win the big one. Reid finally earned his ring with the Chiefs when they beat the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl after the 2019 season. They went back the next year and lost to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe first Super Bowl involving both No. 1 seeds since the Eagles beat the New England Patriots in February 2018 lived up to its hype. It was the third-highest-scoring Super Bowl, and the Eagles scored the most points by a losing team.",

Not kind of, I did hit rock bottom, just trying to figure out who I was, quite frankly, when I wasn't tackling people anymore. I was going through anxiety, depression, and identity issues,\" Mundy said.\n\nWhen he tried to find a therapist, he found it to be \"incredibly difficult.\"\n\n\"Also, my family was going through a laundry list of chronic disease and illness; type 2 diabetes amputation, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, etc. And I just looked out into the marketplace, and I said, 'who's principally focused on the health and wellness and the trajectory of Black health. Quite frankly, not many people, and that's why I got started,\" he said.\n\nMundy launched Alkeme in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. The app offers mental health video courses led by Black experts and therapists, who talk about complex topics that affect the Black community.\n\n\"Generational trauma, being Black in the workplace, so on and so forth. We also make meditations and mindfulness practices that show up on our platform,\" Mundy said.\n\nYou can watch Mundy's full interview about the Alkeme app in the video player above.\n\nAlkeme is featured as one of Apple's Apps of the Day for Black History Month, and can be downloaded from the App Store.

            "text": "When he was hired last year, Bears head coach Matt Eberflus brought Richard Hightower to Chicago to be his special teams coordinator. Hightower returned to Halas Hall, where he briefly coached for one season in 2016, after five years as the special teams coordinator with San Francisco.\n\nAt the same time, general manager Ryan Poles began a wholesale revamp of the roster. With that came changes on special teams. Notably, he allowed longtime Bears punter Pat O\u2019Donnell walk away in free agency. Poles drafted rookie receiver Velus Jones Jr. to be the organization\u2019s next great return man \u2013 with mixed results.\n\nHere\u2019s everything that went well and everything that didn\u2019t on special teams in 2022.\n\nPositives\n\nIn his third season with the Bears, kicker Cairo Santos continued to be rock solid as a place kicker. He made 21 of 23 field goal tries. His 91.3% field goal success rate nearly matched his team-record 93.8% on field goals from 2020. Those are the top two marks in team history, just ahead of Robbie Gould\u2019s best season in 2013 when Gould made 89.7% of his tries.\n\nJones struggled as a punt returner, but finished with the fourth-highest kick return average in the NFL. He ended the season with a 27.6-yard average. His 63-yard return against the Detroit Lions on Jan. 1 was his longest. The Bears hadn\u2019t had a kick return man finish in the top five in average since Cordarrelle Patterson left.\n\nThe Bears drafted punter Trenton Gill out of NC State with a seventh-round pick. Gill proved a reliable rookie punter for the team as it looked to replace O\u2019Donnell. He really impressed his coaches with his work ethic as a holder on kicks. Hightower describes Gill as one of the team\u2019s hardest workers.\n\nNegatives\n\nDespite the field goal success, Santos five extra points, more than he ever has in his career. It was a strange season for him on extra points. It started with two misses in the soggy Week 1 win over the 49ers. Given the crazy weather conditions, that game can be forgiven.\n\nJones struggled early in the season with fumbles on several key punt returns. The Bears had hoped that he could be an ace return specialist as both a kick returner and a punt returner. In 2023, Jones has to regain some confidence in himself on punt returns. He fumbled in Week 4 against the Giants and Week 6 against the Commanders, both one-possession games in the fourth quarter.\n\nDefining moments\n\n1. The Bears used their third-round draft pick, 71st overall, on Jones. It was their third pick of the draft and their third pick on day two after Poles previously drafted cornerback Kyler Gordon and safety Jaquan Brisker. Jones was the Co-SEC Special Teams Player of the Year at Tennessee in 2021.\n\n2. Moments after Roquan Smith intercepted Houston Texans\u2019 QB Davis Mills, Santos knocked a 30-yard field goal through the uprights for a Bears win, 23-20, as the clock struck zero in Week 3. It\u2019s crazy to think that this Bears team was once 2-1.\n\n3. A week later in New Jersey, Jones muffed a punt with just over three minutes remaining in an eight-point game against the New York Giants. The muff all but sunk the Bears in their comeback attempt. They didn\u2019t get the ball back again until the clock was down to 17 seconds.\n\nIt proved to be the first of two critical muffs by Jones on punt returns. He lost the punt return job a few weeks later. Dante Pettis served as the punt returner for the remainder of the season.\n\nMUFFED PUNT. OUR BALL!!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: FOX pic.twitter.com/TICO5ObOyK \u2014 New York Giants (@Giants) October 2, 2022\n\nContract status\n\nSantos has one more season on his contract. Gill has three remaining on his rookie deal, as does Jones. Long snapper Pat Scales is set to become a free agent. Pettis is set to become a free agent. Running backs Khalil Herber and Trestan Ebner also returned kicks and remain under contract.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nSantos needs to make his extra points. The Bears need to find a reliable punt return man.\n\nPlan\n\nThe Bears should look to keep Santos, Gill and Scales together as kicker, holder and long snapper, respectively. They developed a nice chemistry last season.\n\nJones showed down the stretch that he has the potential to be an elite kick returner. That job will likely be his to lose. That\u2019s not the case on punt return, though. That job will likely be an open competition in training camp.",

            "text": "Tollway chief talks about Bears, turnover and construction\n\nIt's been a tumultuous year at the Illinois tollway, with four top leaders flying out the doors.\n\nNew Executive Director Cassaundra Rouse says her feet are firmly planted.\n\nThe Howard University graduate, who has a background in auditing and accounting, joined the tollway in 2012 and became its chief in August.\n\nShe's worked under three administrations -- Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats Pat Quinn and incumbent J.B. Pritzker. Rising up through the ranks to be CEO is atypical; governors often give the nod to an outsider.\n\n\"My priorities revolve around ensuring we continue to deliver exemplary service and critical infrastructure improvements to our customers,\" Rouse said in an interview.\n\n\"First, that requires having great staff in place, from my leadership team all the way through to the employees who interact with our customers. Next, we need to make sure it's easy and convenient for our customers to pay their tolls.\"\n\nAlso, \"the tollway has had a long-standing reputation for delivery of projects with economic impact. I know how important that is to our communities, and that's what I'm making sure we're continuing to do.\"\n\nOne issue roiling the region is how to pay for highway upgrades if the Chicago Bears punt Soldier Field and touch down at the former Arlington Park.\n\nSo, would the agency undertake modernizing a Route 53 currently ill-equipped for football crowds? \"We support the transportation needs of the region and work in partnership with IDOT,\" Rouse said.\n\n\"If the opportunity exists, and if we're asked and at the governor's wishes, then we will, I'm sure, have those discussions.\"\n\nCurrently, she said, the agency is focused on keeping Move Illinois on track. The construction program includes widening the Central Tri-State, extending Route 390 and building I-490.\n\n\"This is our biggest year ... we've allocated $1.5 billion in 2023 for the capital program,\" Rouse said.\n\nTollway turnover at the top hit a high in the last 12 months. Board Chairman Will Evans and Executive Director Jose Alvarez, whose tenures were marked by controversy over procurement and hiring policies, exited in February and March 2022, respectively, amid a power struggle.\n\nThe interim CEO, Lanyea Griffin, inexplicably departed in August 2022, and Chairman Dorothy Abreu left Jan. 30 for health reasons, with no successor named yet.\n\nThe agency is fortunate to have a deep bench of public servants, Rouse said.\n\n\"I have a solid team that is experienced and committed to keeping our day-to-day operations on track,\" she said.\n\nRouse, who is in her early 50s, grew up in Chicago's Beverly neighborhood and now lives in the Flossmoor area. Previously she was a senior auditor at Ernst & Young and audit manager for Arthur Andersen.\n\nAt the tollway she served as chief of internal audit and chief operating officer among other positions.\n\nRouse also belongs to the South Suburban Chapter of Jack and Jill of America Inc., which nurtures future Black leaders. In practice, that's meant mentoring groups of teenagers on college tours.\n\nAsked how often she drives on the tollway system, Rouse said, \"If not for I-355, I am not sure if the tollway would have been a (career) option for me.\"\n\nOver the years, the mother of four needed to fit day care drop-offs and pickups into her schedule, and \"with I-355 there, it actually made the commute doable.\"\n\nRouse is the first Black female tollway executive director, which is significant for a field heavily dominated by men.\n\nWomen's roles in transportation have evolved from where \"we weren't in the room,\" Rouse said. \"Then we moved to being in the room but not necessarily having a voice. Now we not only have a voice, but we've moved to the table.\"\n\nYou should know\n\nGoing to the Chicago Auto Show? Metra and the CTA are a good combination to avoid traffic and parking hassles. Metra riders can walk to the Green Line's Clinton Station from Union Station or Ogilvie Transportation Center and head to the Cermak/McCormick Place stop. Shuttle buses also operate from both downtown train stations.\n\nGridlock alert\n\nBe prepared for delays on the Central Tri-State starting Monday night as tollway crews remove an out-of-service pedestrian bridge near Hinsdale. Lane closures will occur overnight for six days, then resume Feb. 20 for up to two nights.",

            "text": "The latest mock draft from SB Nation is out, and they have the Chicago Bears going in a popular direction by trading back off their first overall selection. I don\u2019t see any scenario the Bears stand pat and pick at one, so let\u2019s examine what the Mothership has the Bears doing here.\n\nThey have the Indianapolis Colts moving up for Chicago\u2019s one and sending their 4th overall pick and 35th overall pick in the 2023 draft and their 2024 1st round pick.\n\n\u201cColts GM Chris Ballard has been very open about going and getting a QB in the draft this year, regardless of their draft position,\u201d writes SB Nation\u2019s Joseph Acosta. \u201cWith the clock possibly ticking on Ballard\u2019s tenure in Indy, he could be looking to make an aggressive move. More importantly than having the first overall pick, Chicago needs as many shots at the dartboard as possible, to really jumpstart their rebuild. The trade benefits both teams.\u201d\n\nNot a bad haul, but if the Colts and Texans fall in love with the same quarterback prospect, they may be able to squeeze more from Indy.\n\nHere are the top four picks he has off his board.\n\nIndianapolis Colts (via Chicago Bears) - Will Levis, QB, Kentucky Houston Texans, Bryce Young, QB, Alabama Arizona Cardinals, Will Anderson, EDGE, Alabama Chicago Bears (via Indianapolis Colts), Jalen Carter, DT, Georgia\n\nCarter to the Bears could happen even if they ink a good three-technique defensive tackle in free agency because you can never have enough quality on the d-line, and Carter can play the one-tech DT in Chicago\u2019s system too.\n\nAlso, with C.J. Stroud still on the board in this scenario, I think another trade back could be in play. The veteran QB market will go a long way toward which teams will have some desperation on draft day.\n\nWith the Super Bowl over, draft buzz will ramp up, but keep in mind this is lying season for teams too. They\u2019ll start to float stuff to insiders about prospects in an attempt to shape what happens. Remember that b.s. that came out about Justin Fields\u2019 work ethic before the 2021 draft? Thanks to whatever moron started that rumor.\n\nWhat do you think about the compensation they have the Bears getting, and would you be OK if Carter was Chicago\u2019s selection?",

They sunk into their sofas as they reflected on one fact that is now a reality.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nMatt Nagy searched for the \u201cwhys\u201d and finally found his answer wearing a number 15 jersey in red and white. The man that famously told the Chicago media he wasn\u2019t an idiot, now has a Super Bowl ring to back that up.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nThe same Matt Nagy that went 6-11 in his final season as Chicago Bears head coach. The same Matt Nagy that Bears fans were all over his last couple of seasons in Chicago, whether it was for his personnel use, his play-calling, his red zone offense or his lack of success running the football.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nDid Matt Nagy suddenly become a better coach? No. Did the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super Bowl in spite of Matt Nagy? No. Is Matt Nagy now part of a better organization and fit better with those coaches and personnel? That answer is yes.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nThe truth about Matt Nagy lies somewhere in a gray area. Is Matt Nagy as good as Andy Reid? Absolutely not. Is he the bumbling idiot Bears fans like to paint him as? That\u2019s not accurate either. Nagy had strengths. Nagy had weaknesses. In the end, those weaknesses outweighed the strengths, but if he learned from his mistakes and improved upon his weaknesses, the truth is that Matt Nagy could have success as an NFL head coach. When Nagy gets another head coaching opportunity probably isn\u2019t a matter of \u201cif,\u201d it\u2019s a matter of \u201cwhen.\u201d\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nThe fact is, Nagy finished his Bears career above .500. He was two inches away from winning a playoff game, and he ran a successful offense in 2018 with Mitch Trubisky as his quarterback. Were there messes along the way? Absolutely. But organizations will see the positives from Nagy\u2019s tenure and focus on those and see what he learned from the negatives. The Chiefs' offense let Tyreek Hill go, and with Matt Nagy, Mahomes had arguably the best season of his career.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that Nagy could be the heir-apparent to Andy Reid, if Reid does in fact decide to hang it up in the near future. Will the Chiefs take a hit going from Reid to Nagy? Of course. But the truth is that Patrick Mahomes appears to be a big supporter of Nagy\u2019s and if the Chiefs give him any say about who replaces Reid, he may champion Nagy as his guy.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nNagy\u2019s hand is going to be a little bit heavier with that hardware on his finger. For Matt Nagy, the champagne is going to taste a little bit sweeter from now on. You can say it was Reid, you can say it was Mahomes, but anyway you slice it, one fact remains.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.\n\nJanuary 10th, 2022 is the date the Chicago Bears decided to part ways with Matt Nagy. Thirteen months and two days later, Chicago Bears fans are looking around with a little bit of bewilderment on their face because today they realized one simple fact.\n\nMatt Nagy is a Super Bowl Champion.",

            "text": "Bears trade Justin Fields in new mock draft\n\nThe Chicago Bears need a quarterback in 2023. Justin Fields spent most of last week talking about his plans to become more of a quarterback. A new mock draft came out with a scenario where the Bears abandon the Fields experiment and draft a new quarterback.\n\nThe 33rd Team scouting department came out with a new mock draft Monday where Justin Fields and Aaron Rodgers are traded to new teams. The 33rd Team scouting department is comprised of former NFL scouts. But one wonders why they\u2019re not currently scouts after reading this new mock draft.\n\nBears trade Fields for his former teammate\n\nThe Bears trade Fields to the Carolina Panthers for their 9th overall pick in the draft. (Since the Bears drafted Fields with the 11th overall pick in 2021, his value would have gone up two spots. But the Bears would still be short on the original deal by just over a first-round pick) The 33rd Team then has the Bears drafting quarterback Bryce Young with the number one pick:\n\n\u201cThe Chicago Bears pull off a shocking trade sending Justin Fields to the Carolina Panthers for the ninth pick of the draft, and here they pick Young (scouting report). The Bears feel like Young is just too talented to pass up and hand the keys to the franchise to the rookie.\u201d\n\nWith the 9th overall pick, the Bears receive Fields\u2019 former teammate Paris Johnson Jr.:\n\n\u201cThe Bears have two picks in the top nine after trading Fields to the Panthers. They pick Johnson (scouting report) to protect their new rookie passer.\u201d\n\nThis is a pretty ridiculous concept by the 33rd Team. They likely made some exciting trades for attention and clicks. The Bears need a Paris Johnson and some receiver help for a quarterback that\u2019s over six-foot tall with an NFL frame. Drafting Young to throw for Johnson would be another step back for the franchise.\n\nThe team has way too many holes to draft a quarterback in the first round this offseason. The Bears need to get a true number-one wide receiver and some pass blockers, then we\u2019ll see if the Bears should start Shopping in the draft for a quarterback in the 2024 draft.\n\nFor More Great Chicago Sports Content\n\nFollow us on Twitter at @chicitysports23 for more great content.

            "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. \u2013 As it is with every Super Bowl, there are a few people with Chicago ties that had the opportunity to raise the Lombardi Trophy when their team wins the big game.\n\nThat was the case for a former head coach of the Bears, who got to do so just a year after being fired.\n\nMatt Nagy won his first Super Bowl title on Sunday as the Chiefs defeated the Eagles 38-35 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. He\u2019s in his first year as the senior assistant and quarterbacks coach in his second stint as an assistant under head coach Andy Reid.\n\nThis comes just 13 months after Nagy was fired as the Bears\u2019 on-field leader after four seasons. After being named NFL Coach of the Year in 2018 after the team went 12-4 and won the NFC North, inconsistency plagued the rest of his tenure as the team failed to finish over .500 again.\n\nAfter back-to-back 8-8 seasons, with the team sneaking into the playoffs in 2020 as the last Wild Card, Nagy\u2019s tenure ended went the team went 6-11 in 2021.\n\nJoining back up with Reid, whom he coached with in Philadelphia from 2008 through 2012 then in Kansas City from 2013-2017, Nagy jumped right back into a successful system with the Chiefs. He had the chance to work directly with quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the NFL\u2019s MVP for the 2022 season, as they went 14-3 to clinch the top seed in the AFC for the playoffs.\n\nKansas City defeated Jacksonville and Cincinnati in the postseason to reach their third Super Bowl in four years, then knocked off the Eagles in a tight battle on Sunday. The Chiefs\u2019 offense scored on all of their second half possession, including Harrison Butker\u2019s 27-yard field goal that won the game with eight seconds left.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl that Nagy had coached in, having only gone as far as the conference championship before the 2022 season. In his first year as a coaching intern with the Eagles in 2008, the team made the NFC title game but lost to the Cardinals in Glendale.\n\nAs head coach of the Bears, Nagy\u2019s teams were defeated in the Wild Card round by Philadelphia (2018 season) and New Orleans (2020 season).",

            "text": "The 2022-23 NFL season has officially come to an end, with the year coming to an end after Super Bowl LVII on Sunday.\n\nIt was a tough year for the Bears from a record perspective, as their 3-14 finish was the worst in the league. Though having the No. 1 pick is usually a sign that things in the organization are not going well, there is still quite a bit of optimism surrounding the team\u2019s long-term future. With plenty of draft capital, the most cap space in the NFL, and a talented young quarterback in Justin Fields at their disposal, the opportunity for the team to grow this offseason is massive.\n\nTo forecast where Chicago stands with the offseason now underway, let\u2019s break down each position on the Bears\u2019 and rank them based off of need. The lower down on the list a position may be, the bigger the need it is.\n\nIn addition to this internal analysis, I will discuss potential free agency and draft options at each position. I will not only be breaking down realistic draft targets for specific positions, but I will also be including more realistic free agent options, as opposed to the most popular free agents at each position.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s begin.\n\n14. Punter\n\nRoster:\n\nTrenton Gill\n\nThe Bears just drafted Gill last year, and he did a solid job as a rookie. He\u2019s not going anywhere any time soon.\n\nFree agents:\n\nBradley Pinion, Falcons\n\nJ.K. Scott, Chargers\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nBryce Baringer, Michigan State (Round 6-7)\n\nAdam Korsak, Rutgers (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nMichael Turk, Oklahoma (Round 7-UDFA)\n\n13. Long snapper\n\nRoster:\n\nPatrick Scales (UFA)\n\nScales is a free agent this year, and while he just turned 35 years old, he\u2019s been as reliable as they come as he enters his ninth year with the organization. They could hypothetically go in a different direction, but I find it doubtful.\n\nFree agents:\n\nRick Lovato, Eagles\n\nJoe Cardona, Patriots\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nRobert Soderholm, VMI (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nAlex Ward, UCF (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nChris Stoll, Penn State (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nMatt Hembrough, Oklahoma State (Round 7-UDFA)\n\n12. Quarterback\n\nRoster:\n\nJustin Fields\n\nTrevor Siemian\n\nNathan Peterman (UFA)\n\nTim Boyle (UFA)\n\nIf the Bears draft a quarterback in the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft, I will eat my own skin and post it online. A Day 3 backup isn\u2019t out of the question, but they have no need to use significant draft capital there this year.\n\nFree agents:\n\nMike White, Jets\n\nNick Mullens, Vikings\n\nDrew Lock, Seahawks\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nHendon Hooker, Tennessee (Round 3-4)\n\nJake Haener, Fresno State (Round 5-6)\n\nTyson Bagent, Shepherd (Round 6-7)\n\nLindsey Scott Jr., Incarnate Word (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nDorian Thompson-Robinson, UCLA (Round 7-UDFA)\n\n11. Safety\n\nRoster:\n\nEddie Jackson\n\nJaquan Brisker\n\nElijah Hicks\n\nA.J. Thomas\n\nDeAndre Houston-Carson (UFA)\n\nDaine Cruikshank (UFA)\n\nAdrian Colbert (futures)\n\nJackson and Brisker have the two starting safety spots locked down for the Bears. Houston-Carson is valuable depth, assuming he re-signs, and Hicks just got drafted last year. They might add a safety to a cheap deal in free agency or draft some depth on Day 3, but the position won\u2019t be a priority this offseason.\n\nFree agents:\n\nArmani Watts, Colts\n\nJustin Evans, Saints\n\nSean Chandler, Panthers\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nJi\u2019Ayir Brown, Penn State (Round 5-6)\n\nJason Taylor, Oklahoma State (Round 6-7)\n\nChristian Young, Arizona (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nAnthony Johnson, Iowa State (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nBenny Sapp III, Northern Iowa (Round 7-UDFA)\n\n10. Kicker\n\nRoster:\n\nCairo Santos\n\nSantos had some issues with extra points in 2022, but his contract structuring makes it unlikely the Bears will move on from him this offseason. He has otherwise been a steady presence for their special teams unit over the last few years.\n\nFree agents:\n\nRiley Patterson, Jaguars\n\nEddy Pineiro, Panthers\n\nMatt Gay, Rams\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nChad Ryland, Maryland (Round 5-6)\n\nJake Moody, Michigan (Round 6-7)\n\nAndre Szmyt, Syracuse (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nJack Podlesny, Georgia (Round 7-UDFA)\n\n9. Tight end\n\nRoster:\n\nCole Kmet\n\nRyan Griffin (UFA)\n\nTrevon Wesco (UFA)\n\nChase Allen (futures)\n\nJake Tonges (futures)\n\nKmet\u2019s positioning as the Bears\u2019 starting tight end in 2023 is as secure as it comes. He\u2019s eligible for an extension this offseason, but whether or not they sign him to a long-term deal, they could use better depth and a stronger TE2 on their roster.\n\nFree agents:\n\nRobert Tonyan, Packers\n\nFoster Moreau, Raiders\n\nIrv Smith Jr., Vikings\n\nJosh Oliver, Ravens\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nDarnell Washington, Georgia (Round 2)\n\nWill Mallory, Miami (FL) (Round 4-5)\n\nCameron Latu, Alabama (Round 4-5)\n\nLeonard Taylor, Michigan State (Round 7-UDFA)\n\nThomas Greany, Albany (Round 7-UDFA)\n\n8. Cornerback\n\nRoster:\n\nJaylon Johnson\n\nKyler Gordon\n\nKindle Vildor\n\nJaylon Jones\n\nMichael Ojemudia\n\nBreon Borders (RFA)\n\nHarrison Hand (RFA)\n\nJosh Blackwell (ERFA)\n\nGreg Stroman (futures)\n\nJohnson and Gordon are locks to start in the Bears\u2019 secondary in 2023, but the other starting cornerback position remains up in the air. Injuries at the position showcased a general lack of depth down the stretch this past year, so some sort of investment there would make sense.\n\nFree agents:\n\nJamel Dean, Buccaneers\n\nRock Ya-Sin, Raiders\n\nByron Murphy, Cardinals\n\nSean Murphy-Bunting, Buccaneers\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nDarius Rush, South Carolina (Round 3-4)\n\nRiley Moss, Iowa (Round 3-4)\n\nJakorian Bennett, Maryland (Round 4-5)\n\nStarling Thomas V, UAB (Round 5-6)\n\nTerell Smith, Minnesota (Round 6-7)\n\n7. Running back\n\nRoster:\n\nKhalil Herbert\n\nTrestan Ebner\n\nDavid Montgomery (UFA)\n\nFB Khari Blasingame (UFA)\n\nDarrynton Evans (RFA)\n\nTime will tell if the Bears choose to re-sign Montgomery, which would make running back much less of a need for them this offseason. If he ends up switching teams, the position will have to become more of a priority. Herbert is a solid starter but needs a complementary back who can contribute on passing downs and take the load off on the ground sometimes.\n\nFree agents:\n\nSaquon Barkley, Giants\n\nJosh Jacobs, Raiders\n\nTony Pollard, Cowboys\n\nMiles Sanders, Eagles\n\nJamaal Williams, Lions\n\nJeff Wilson, Dolphins\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nTyjae Spears, Tulane (Round 3-4)\n\nChase Brown, Illinois (Round 3-4)\n\nKenny McIntosh, Georgia (Round 3-4)\n\nEvan Hull, Northwestern (Round 5-6)\n\nJordan Mims, Fresno State (Round 6-7)\n\n6. Interior offensive line\n\nRoster:\n\nTeven Jenkins\n\nCody Whitehair (cut candidate)\n\nLucas Patrick (cut candidate)\n\nJa\u2019Tyre Carter\n\nAlex Leatherwood\n\nDoug Kramer\n\nMichael Schofield (UFA)\n\nDakota Dozier (UFA)\n\nSam Mustipher (RFA)\n\nDieter Eiselen (ERFA)\n\nI\u2019m coming into this anticipating the Bears will keep both of Jenkins and Whitehair at the two starting guard positions. The latter could feasibly be cut to save some money, but with how many other spots Chicago has to fill, my guess is he\u2019s safe for another year. Patrick didn\u2019t work out at center even when healthy, and Mustipher is a solid backup option but not someone to tie significant long-term investment to.\n\nFree agents:\n\nEthan Pocic, Browns\n\nIsaac Seumalo, Eagles\n\nBen Powers, Ravens\n\nNate Davis, Titans\n\nGarrett Bradbury, Vikings\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nJohn Michael Schmitz, Minnesota (Round 1-2)\n\nCody Mauch, North Dakota State (Round 1-2)\n\nJoe Tippman, Wisconsin (Round 2-3)\n\nSteve Avila, TCU (Round 2-3)\n\nJuice Scruggs, Penn State (Round 4-5)\n\nMark Evans II, Arkansas-Pine Bluff (Round 5-6)\n\n5. Wide receiver\n\nRoster:\n\nDarnell Mooney\n\nChase Claypool\n\nVelus Jones Jr.\n\nEquanimeous St. Brown\n\nN\u2019Keal Harry (UFA)\n\nByron Pringle (UFA)\n\nDante Pettis (UFA)\n\nDaurice Fountain (futures)\n\nJoe Reed (futures)\n\nNsimba Webster (futures)\n\nAlmost by default, Claypool has to be better than he was in 2022. With a full offseason to grasp a difficult playbook and gain chemistry with Justin Fields, my guess is that will happen. He and Mooney should be a serviceable starting tandem if both can stay healthy, but they still need another high-end starting option. Jones seems like a good gadget piece but might not develop into much more, while St. Brown is solid depth but shouldn\u2019t be expected to be anything else. A receiver in Round 1 is unlikely, but don\u2019t rule out a trade for a veteran starter or another Day 2 selection. Maybe they\u2019ll add an additional first-rounder for 2024 to get a top weapon like Marvin Harrison Jr. in next year\u2019s draft?\n\nFree agents:\n\nAllen Lazard, Packers\n\nJakobi Meyers, Patriots\n\nD.J. Chark, Lions\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, Chiefs\n\nOdell Beckham Jr., free agent\n\nMaybe one of Michael Thomas or Keenan Allen\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, Ohio State (Round 1-2)\n\nRashee Rice, SMU (Round 2-3)\n\nXavier Hutchinson, Iowa State (Round 2-3)\n\nMichael Wilson, Stanford (Round 3-4)\n\nAndrei Iosivas, Princeton (Round 3-4)\n\nA.T. Perry, Wake Forest (Round 3-4)\n\nPuka Nacua, BYU (Round 4-5)\n\nJadon Haselwood, Arkansas (Round 6-7)\n\n4. Linebacker\n\nRoster:\n\nJack Sanborn\n\nSterling Weatherford\n\nNicholas Morrow (UFA)\n\nMatt Adams (UFA)\n\nJoe Thomas (UFA)\n\nElijah Lee (UFA)\n\nDeMarquis Gates (ERFA)\n\nJavin White (ERFA)\n\nKuony Deng (futures)\n\nTrading Roquan Smith gave the Bears more cap flexibility and an extra second-round pick this offseason, but it also opened up a big weakness on their roster. Sanborn has a small NFL sample size but far exceeded expectations and deserves a fair chance to retain a starting role. Weatherford is a special teamer and the only other contracted linebacker on the active roster. Chicago has money to burn, so expect them to spend on a starting option within the range of $6-13 million AAV.\n\nFree agents:\n\nBobby Okereke, Colts\n\nT.J. Edwards, Eagles\n\nDavid Long, Titans\n\nTremaine Edmunds, Bills\n\nLeighton Vander Esch, Cowboys\n\nDrue Tranquil, Chargers\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nJack Campbell, Iowa (Round 3-4)\n\nOwen Pappoe, Auburn (Round 3-4)\n\nDaiyan Henley, Washington State (Round 4-5)\n\nDee Winters, TCU (Round 4-5)\n\nAubrey Miller Jr., Jackson State (Round 6-7)\n\nFree agents:\n\nBears draft targets:\n\n3. Offensive tackle\n\nRoster:\n\nBraxton Jones\n\nLarry Borom\n\nRiley Reiff (UFA)\n\nKellen Diesch (futures)\n\nThe development of Jones into one of the best rookie offensive linemen from the 2022 draft class was a welcomed one, and while he seems to project into the starting left tackle role again next year, the Bears need to find a new right tackle. Borom is good depth but didn\u2019t build upon his rookie year, and there are way better scheme fits out there in both free agency and the draft. Offensive tackle will surely be a priority this offseason.\n\nFree agents:\n\nKaleb McGary, Falcons\n\nMike McGlinchey, 49ers\n\nJawaan Taylor, Jaguars\n\nIsaiah Wynn, Patriots\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nPeter Skoronski, Northwestern (Round 1)\n\nParis Johnson Jr., Ohio State (Round 1)\n\nBroderick Jones, Georgia (Round 1)\n\nAnton Harrison, Oklahoma (Round 1-2)\n\nDarnell Wright, Tennessee (Round 1-2)\n\nMatthew Bergeron, Syracuse (Round 2-3)\n\nWanya Morris, Oklahoma (Round 3-4)\n\nTyler Steen, Alabama (Round 4-5)\n\n2. Defensive tackle\n\nRoster:\n\nJustin Jones (cut candidate)\n\nAngelo Blackson (UFA)\n\nMike Pennel (UFA)\n\nArmon Watts (UFA)\n\nAndrew Brown (RFA)\n\nDonovan Jeter (futures)\n\nI don\u2019t think Jones will be cut this offseason, as he\u2019s the only contracted active defensive tackle on the Bears\u2019 roster, and he truthfully wasn\u2019t terrible in 2022. That said, the rest of the interior defensive line was quite bad this past year, generating next to no pressure on the quarterback and showing inconsistencies against the run. With how important the 3-technique is to Matt Eberflus\u2019 defense, it\u2019s no surprise the unit failed; the interior defensive line was hot garbage.\n\nFree agents:\n\nDaron Payne, Commanders\n\nJavon Hargrave, Eagles\n\nDre\u2019Mont Jones, Broncos\n\nDalvin Tomlinson, Vikings\n\nZach Allen, Cardinals\n\nDavid Onyemata, Saints\n\nSheldon Rankins, Jets\n\nMatt Ioannidis, Panthers\n\nBears draft targets:\n\nJalen Carter, Georgia (Round 1)\n\nBryan Bresee (Round 1)\n\nSiaki Ika, Baylor (Round 1-2)\n\nKeeanu Benton, Wisconsin (Round 2-3)\n\nTuli Tuipulotu, USC (Round 2-3)\n\nKarl Brooks, Bowling Green (Round 4-5)\n\nJaquelin Roy, LSU (Round 5-6)\n\nKobie Turner, Wake Forest (Round 6-7)\n\n1. Defensive end\n\nRoster:\n\nTrevis Gipson\n\nAl-Quadin Muhammad (cut candidate)\n\nDominique Robinson\n\nJalyn Holmes (UFA)\n\nTerrell Lewis (UFA)\n\nGerri Green (futures)\n\nThe Bears had a total of 6.5 sacks come from the edge rusher position in 2022, and one of them was from Robert Quinn, whom the team traded away after 7 games. Simply put, they lack any starting-caliber talent at defensive end. In a league where generating pressure on the quarterback is valued highly, the Bears have arguably the worst group of pass-rushers in the NFL.

            "text": "Fields thinks a Tee Higgins trade would be 'awesome' originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago\n\nThe Tee Higgins to Chicago Bears trade roller coaster is just getting started.\n\nNow that the NFL is entering the offseason, trade rumors around Higgins will continue to swirl and pick up steam.\n\nIt was a hot talking point during Super Bowl media week, and even Bears' franchise quarterback Justin Fields weighed in.\n\n\"That'd be awesome,\" Fields told USA Today's Mackenze Salmon about a hypothetical trade.\n\nAnd perhaps the more intriguing part of a potential Fields-Higgins pairing is there is already some semblance f a relationship there.\n\n\"We're actually part of the same agency,\" Fields said. \"So I get to see him work out in the offseason once every year. He's a great player, great size, great receiver, and he's just really smooth. So of course, the things he can do on the outside with the jump ball, the route running. He's an awesome player.\"\n\nThe trade speculation surrounding Higgins is based on an assumption he might be available. Higgins hasn't requested a trade.\n\nBig extensions due to Higgins, quarterback Joe Burrow and wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, which prognosticators have deduced that Higgins could be a trade candidate as the odd man out.\n\nHiggins has actually expressed a desire to stay in Cincinnati for a long time.\n\nNow Higgins only controls one end of this, the Bengals need to want to keep Higgins as well and there is no discernable reason they wouldn't aside from financial issues.\n\nThere are reports the Bengals could trade Higgins if his demands are outrageous, which is true of a lot of players. But they can make the numbers work even with Burrow and Chase, as NBC Sports Chicago's Josh Schrock outlined.\n\nBut as NBC Sports' Peter King noted, being having the cap space to extend Higgins doesn't mean they will.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe Bengals might not want to trade Tee Higgins,\" King said. \"But they also might not have a lot of great choices because \u2013 I think one of the things in football today that people don\u2019t think enough about is that, so Mike Brown, I covered the Bengals my first year covering the NFL in 1984. Not a lot has changed, relatively speaking. They are a family-run business in all ways, and they don\u2019t have a lot of dough.\n\n\"They are going to have to find $175 million to put in escrow for Joe Burrow\u2019s contract this offseason. That\u2019s obviously not going to be easy. Then you have to say, \u2018How exactly are they going to pay Tee Higgins a long-term deal?\u2019 Even if you could do a bridge this year. Even if he could last one more year, I just don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to pay Tee Higgins market value when you have to pay Joe Burrow. He\u2019s one I would look at.\"\n\nA star wide receiver is a priority for the Bears. It could also be vital to Fields taking the next step like other young quarterbacks around he league.\n\nFans have seen the leap young quarterbacks have taken when they got a star wide receiver, like Josh Allen with Stefon Diggs for the Buffalo Bills. Or Jalen Hurts with A.J. Brown for the Philadelphia Eagles, who are playing in the Super Bowl. Or even Tua Tagovailoa with Tyreek Hill for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nAnd they want one for Justin Fields.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

They own the No. 1 overall selection, but they also have a talented signal-caller already on their squad in Justin Fields, while multiple teams are looking for a face-of-the-franchise type at the game's most important position.\n\nIndianapolis general manager Chris Ballard has already said the Colts will \"do whatever it takes\" to trade up for their favorite quarterback in this class. It's easy to connect the dots between Chicago and Indy, because Matt Eberflus was the Colts' defensive coordinator before becoming the Bears' head coach. The Houston Texans will likely not stand by, however, and allow their division rival to leapfrog them for their top choice of passers.\n\nIn this three-round mock, I project the Bears pulling off three of the six listed trades; they first move to the Texans' second pick and then step down again to the Colts' No. 4 slot. At least one of the top defenders in the draft will be available at No. 4, possibly the one they would've chosen if they had just stayed at No. 1.\n\nTaking the Texans' offer could be risky for the Bears if the Colts stay at No. 4 after being beaten out for the top spot -- but doing \"whatever it takes\" means Ballard is incentivized to climb the draft ladder. Opening Door No. 1 and Door No. 2 in the trade game allows Chicago GM Ryan Poles to hedge his bets in the hopes that at least one of the two partners send over very early picks after a disappointing 2023 campaign.\n\nNo matter which trade adventure Poles and the Bears choose, the franchise wins by netting one of the top defenders in the class while gathering current and future draft capital.",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears have a lot of work to do this off-season when it comes to upgrading the roster. After the first offseason with general manager Ryan Poles was focused on cleaning up the roster and salary cap, this offseason will be about adding talent around their foundational pieces. Offensively, that means improving the supporting cast around quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nFields showed some real signs of growth in his second season in the NFL. He improved across the board when it came to his production, looking more and more comfortable as the season moved along.\n\nWhat Fields was able to accomplish in 2022 was quite impressive given the circumstances. He was the most sacked quarterback in the NFL, getting taken down 55 times. The skill-position groups around him were lacking, to say the least.\n\nDespite that, he fell just short of breaking Lamar Jackson\u2019s single-season rushing record, which was 1,206 yards. Fields finished with 1,143 in 15 games as he led a truly dominant run game. Looking to put some talent around him, could the Bears have a new starting running back in 2023?\n\nOne former NFL executive that spoke to NFL Analysis Network certainly thinks so. They believe that one of the moves that the Bears will make in free agency is a splash signing at the running back position to upgrade the backfield.\n\n\u201cJosh Jacobs is going to have a massive market with quite a few contenders interested. However, I think he\u2019ll end up in Chicago. They will build an elite offense around Justin Fields this year and Jacobs will be a key part of doing that.\u201d\n\nWith David Montgomery hitting free agency this offseason, this NFL executive believes the Bears are going to replace him with Josh Jacobs. Jacobs, who had his fifth-year option declined by the Las Vegas Raiders during the 2022 offseason, is set to cash in as a free agent this year.\n\nJacobs led the NFL with 1,653 yards, adding 12 rushing touchdowns. His 393 total touches and 2,053 yards from scrimmage also led the league. The Alabama product has put himself in a great spot when it comes to cashing in and maximizing his value.\n\nArmed with the most cap space in the league this offseason, the Bears are going to be able to throw their weight around a little bit in free agency. They should make some aggressive offers to improve the roster and start climbing out of their rebuild. Jacobs would make for an intriguing target, offering an upgrade over Montgomery and another explosive option to take advantage of offensively.",

            "text": "It is not talked about as much as other spots, but the Chicago Bears will have to add a tight end in free agency this offseason. Beyond Cole Kmet, they just have some practice squad options signed. They likely will want to re-sign Trevon Wesco, but that is not assured, and they certainly will be replacing Ryan Griffin.\n\nA more notable name that could be added is Foster Moreau. Moreau has 1,107 receiving yards in four seasons, so he is not a big name that is often discussed, but he is coming off of a 420-yard season, which was the best of his career.\n\nHe has spent his first four seasons in the NFL with the Raiders, so the surrounding environment has been a roller coaster. Still, as the years have gone, he has continued to grow.\n\nHe played 373 snaps as a rookie, then 257 the following year. However, over the last two years he played 776 and 745 snaps, showing that he was becoming an impact player. Some of that has to do with injuries to Darren Waller, but some of it is because he is the perfect complement to Darren Waller.\n\nMoreau is a trusted in-line tight end a solid blocker. So, the Raiders can line him up off of the tackle, then flex Darren Waller out to the slot. With Waller in the slot, he creates more in the passing game, and the Raiders do not need to be as deep at wideout.\n\nThey essentially use Hunter Renfrow, Davante Adams, and then Darren Waller as their third. The Chicago Bears could add Foster Moreau with a similar idea.\n\nSure, Cole Kmet is not Darren Waller as a receiver, but he is growing in that area every year. One reason Kmet was more efficient this season despite fewer targets was the emergence of Wesco. With Wesco blocking, Kmet was freed up and went from two touchdowns in two seasons to seven in 2022.\n\nFoster Moreau would just be an upgraded option over Wesco. Not only would he be a better blocker, but there is also a significant upgrade in the passing game as well. The realization that having this type of reliability at the tight end two spot makes the need for a third receiver less daunting can only increase the validity of this idea. The wide receiver market is blowing up, but there is still great value in a tight end who just finished his rookie contract and may have his best play ahead of him.\n\nWith Foster Moreau next to Cole Kmet, they can pack teams in heavy, but still, have the ability to pass and use the explosive legs of Justin Fields. It is not a bad idea. The Chicago Bears have to sign a tight end, so now the question is whether they look for a low-end guy or a reliable second option. If they go with a sturdy second option, then Foster Moreau is on their radar.",
