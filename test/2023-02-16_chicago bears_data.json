            "text": "GM Ryan Poles doesn\u2019t want to build through free agency. He\u2019s made that clear since he took over the Chicago Bears last year. Even so, this roster needs help. A lot of help. The Bears have $98 million in salary cap space. While Poles may not go on a shopping spree, the widespread belief is he will take one or two big swings on the early market to shore up key spots. What nobody knows for sure at this point is which position the Bears will see as a priority. Most assume they will target a top defensive tackle to improve their interior pass rush. Names like Da\u2019Ron Payne and Dre\u2019Mont Jones come to mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent buzz suggests that might not be the case. Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune discussed the Bears\u2019 free agency plans. He made it seem like the team will try to pounce on the market early, not at defensive tackle but offensive tackle.\n\nOn the offensive line, it\u2019s a decent bet the Bears will move quickly to sign a right tackle. They might be in play for Orlando Brown Jr. if the Chiefs don\u2019t keep him \u2014 and he would be the new starting left tackle \u2014 but Poles has expressed faith in Braxton Jones after the 2022 fifth-round pick was the only offensive player to log every snap. If the Bears believe Jones is trending upward, they could focus on right tackle, where they\u2019ve had a different Week 1 starter for three consecutive years.\n\nBiggs isn\u2019t alone.\n\nBill Zimmerman of Windy City Gridiron was down in Arizona for the Super Bowl. After digging into various sources, he came away with a similar assessment. Once the market opens next month, the Bears are likely to move fast on the right tackles.\n\n\u201cI think the one thing everyone agrees on is that the Bears are going to sign a right tackle. Which one was up for debate, but a right tackle might be number one on their priority board. Plenty of names surfaced: Mike McGlinchey, Caleb McGary, Juwaan Taylor, and even Orlando Brown (I can\u2019t see that one personally). I think we will definitely see some movement there early in free agency.\u201d\n\nThis is a logical move for the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe reality is there isn\u2019t a tackle in this draft class that is worth taking #1 overall. There isn\u2019t even one worth taking in the top five. It seems unwise to wait until the late 2nd round to find an option at such an important position. Signing a proven veteran would help stabilize the edges, assuming Jones takes a step forward in 2023 at left tackle. Then Poles can use the draft to focus on the guard and center positions, which are far easier to find outside the 1st round.\n\nIt comes down to who is available and who the Chicago Bears prefer. McGlinchey and McGary can be classified as excellent run blockers who are okay in pass protection. Taylor is the opposite. He\u2019s emerged as a solid pass protector who gets by in run blocking. If the Bears stick to their current identity, then McGlinchey or McGary would be the targets. If they wish to help Justin Fields emerge as more of a passer, then Taylor makes more sense. Money will play a part in it too. Free agency begins March 15th. The legal tampering period where negotiations can take place starts on the 13th. News of anything will surface around that time.",

The team played at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970, and if a new stadium is constructed, the franchise would have its name on the mortgage for the first time since arriving in Chicago.\n\nEconomic analysts have said building a Bears entertainment district would create more than 48,000 jobs and generate $9.4 billion for the local economy.\n\nJustin Fields scores a touchdown for the Bears at Soldier Field this season as the team explores building a new stadium. Mark Black/UPI/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cThe Bears will continue to work closely alongside the Village of Arlington Heights, surrounding municipalities and their residents to solicit extensive feedback on how we can best benefit local communities and Bears fans across Illinois,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis planning will include a robust diversity, equity and inclusion program that prioritizes local hiring throughout every stage of the development.\u201d\n\nThe Bears envision restaurants, retail and more on the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field \u2014 all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears plan to pay for their stadium, but want taxpayer dollars to cover infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers.\n\nThe city of Chicago proposed last summer enclosing Soldier Field and increasing its capacity from a league-low 61,500. But the Bears have insisted the only possibilities they were considering were for the Arlington Heights site.\n\nIt will be up to new president and CEO Kevin Warren to help the Bears\u2019 vision for a new home become a reality. He was hired last month after spending three years as commissioner of the Big Ten.\n\nWarren, who\u2019s replacing the retiring Ted Phillips, worked in the NFL for more than two decades. He was part of Minnesota\u2019s front office from 2005-19, ascending to chief operating officer in 2015, and played a big role in the Vikings\u2019 construction of U.S. Bank Stadium.\n\nThe Bears see that stadium, which opened in 2016, as a model for their potential new home, with its translucent roof and massive glass panels letting in enough light and air to make fans feel as if they\u2019re outdoors.",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears embarked on a new era Wednesday with the purchase of a site in Arlington Heights where the team hopes to build a new enclosed stadium with a massive entertainment and residential development.\n\nDespite the sale, the organization maintains the stadium and development are still big \u201cifs,\u201d dependent on the team getting property tax limits and public subsidies to help build infrastructure for the project. The team issued an open letter calling the purchase \u201can important next step\u201d to see if the plan is feasible \u2014 while Chicago officials responded by saying they\u2019ll negotiate with the team to keep it in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s spokesman, Ryan Johnson, wrote that a \u201creimagined\u201d Soldier Field can meet the Bears\u2019 needs, saying the team would benefit economically more by staying than leaving.\n\nBy shelling out $197 million for the 326-acre Arlington International Racecourse site, team officials plan to leave behind Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field in favor of owning their own stadium where they could also hold marquee events like the Super Bowl or NCAA basketball championships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement comes shortly after a \u201cmegaprojects\u201d bill was introduced in Springfield that could help the Bears finance their plans by freezing the property tax assessment for up to 40 years. But state lawmakers from Chicago are unlikely to help the Bears leave, and downstate legislators will want something in return. Even the bill\u2019s sponsor, state Sen. Ann Gillespie, a Democrat from Arlington Heights, has expressed doubts about the measure.\n\nThere already is opposition in Springfield to tax breaks for the Bears to leave Soldier Field, where they have played since 1971. When state lawmakers recently created a fund to attract companies to locate in Illinois, they went out of their way to prohibit its use for pro sports teams that relocate within the state.\n\nOur open letter regarding the closing on Arlington Park property: \u2014 Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) February 15, 2023\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker has also voiced his objection to state subsidies, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not our obligation as the state to step in and provide major funding, and I certainly don\u2019t want to burden taxpayers with, you know, major support for a private business.\u201d\n\nThe team faces several other obstacles to making its dream come true. Local school officials have raised concerns that they will get more students from new housing as part of the project, but with reduced revenue due to tax breaks for the team.\n\nThat prospect has prompted some school districts to move forward with hiring a lobbyist to influence the legislation.Arlington Heights leaders have said they are encouraging the parties involved to listen to local interests like the school districts.\n\nThe relocation also would come with a penalty if the Bears break their lease early at Soldier Field, which runs through 2033. If the team left in 2026, it would be on the hook for an $84 million penalty.\n\nExpand Autoplay Image 1 of 6 A rendering released by the Chicago Bears shows the view from the threshold of the proposed stadium of the Arlington Park entertainment district.

(Hart Howerton/Chicago Bears)\n\nArlington Heights Mayor Thomas Hayes has welcomed the team to his village, while saying residents\u2019 concerns about traffic and other aspects must be addressed. The Village Board has signaled its general support for the move by approving a preliminary, nonbinding agreement with the team that provides for potential subsidies including special tax breaks for the area.\n\nBut the Illinois chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers-funded libertarian group, has fought any \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d for the project, and hopes to put a referendum on the ballot to oppose any local subsidies. The group also published a poll showing that Arlington Heights residents welcome the Bears but don\u2019t want to pay extra taxes for the relocation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[ Chicago Bears\u2019 land deal comes 2 weeks before the city election. Some say a possible team move could \u2018wound\u2019 Mayor Lori Lightfoot, others shrug.[Don\u2019t miss] ]\n\nIronically, the Bears\u2019 historic move was set in motion in 2002, when Chicago tried to appease the team by renovating Soldier Field at a cost of $690 million. Taxpayers are still paying for their $432 million \u2014 plus interest \u2014 share of the renovation that was roundly criticized.\n\nBy cramming a modern stadium inside a historic landmark, the result was the smallest stadium in the National Football League, with a capacity of 61,500, and a lack of amenities that many other stadiums have.\n\nThe team rents from the Chicago Park District for about $6.5 million a year \u2014 less than they\u2019ve paid some of the team\u2019s star players \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t control revenue from naming rights, parking or concessions. In the past, the playing field was often in bad shape, and relations with the Park District sometimes were strained. WBEZ reported that the Park District rebuffed the team\u2019s initial proposal for a sports betting lounge in 2021.\n\nThe team did, however, raise money from fans paying for high-priced personal seat licenses required to get season tickets after the renovation. If the new stadium goes through, the team would likely require fans to pay again for new seat licenses.\n\nThe Arlington International Racecourse property in Arlington Heights is seen on Feb. 8, 2023. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune)\n\nIn 2021, Churchill Downs announced the racecourse land was for sale and ended horse racing there. The Bears announced a preliminary purchase agreement in September of that year. It took until now for team officials to investigate and close the deal.\n\nLast year, the team announced plans for an enclosed $2 billion stadium on the site, which the Bears said they would pay for themselves. The team asked for taxpayer help to build the new roads, utilities and other infrastructure for the $5 billion multiuse development, likely to include apartments, condominiums, bars, restaurants, a hotel, green space and parking lots. The racetrack would be demolished, but access from the existing Metra station would be enhanced, along with new entrances and exits from the adjacent Route 53.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot initially dismissed the Bears\u2019 proposal as \u201cnoise,\u201d saying they should concentrate on winning. Last summer, though, in a bid to keep the team, the city proposed a $2 billion plan to put a dome on Soldier Field. Team officials said they were not considering any deals other than for the racecourse, which opened in 1927 and for decades was officially known as Arlington Park.\n\nThe team estimated a $1 billion annual economic impact from the development, but economists generally warn that subsidized stadium deals usually do not repay public investment.\n\nRecent stadium construction elsewhere shows such an undertaking requires years of work.\n\n[ [Don\u2019t miss] Catch up on all the Chicago Bears headlines about the stadium move ]\n\nAllegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play their home games, cost $1.9 billion to build with construction beginning in 2017 and the arena opening in July 2020. SoFi Stadium, in Inglewood, California, had a much larger price tag, estimated at $5.5 billion, and benefits from hosting two teams. The home to the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers also opened in 2020.\n\nLast month, Bears owners and chairman George McCaskey said the Arlington Park property was the team\u2019s \u201csingular focus\u201d in exploring new stadium possibilities. New Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren further emphasized that the team was not currently in a position to consider grand proposals for upgrading or revamping Soldier Field.\n\n\u201cI look forward to leaning into the stadium development project,\u201d Warren said during his introductory news conference at Halas Hall. \u201cBut I think the biggest thing we can do is to make sure we\u2019re methodical and detailed and we take the time to plan it properly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the chief operating officer of the Minnesota Vikings, Warren was at the forefront of leading that organization\u2019s construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in downtown Minneapolis, which opened in 2016. That project cost $1.06 billion.\n\nU.S. Bank Stadium hosted Super Bowl LII in February 2018 and was the site of the men\u2019s Final Four a year later.\n\nWarren said last month that, with a potential new Bears stadium, his aim would be to \u201ccreate an atmosphere that becomes a 365-day-a-year environment.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot to do,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nShould the team proceed, the development would be one of the largest projects in Midwest history. The team estimated that construction would create 48,000 jobs and $9 billion in economic stimulus, and once completed, would generate more than $1 billion in annual economic impact.\n\nEconomists generally have questioned such projections. The village of Arlington Heights has hired its own consultant to review the numbers and see whether they would repay local taxpayer investment.\n\nThe team said it will continue meeting with local residents, small business owners, school districts, elected officials and other interested stakeholders to get their input.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor the development to move forward,\u201d the team stated, \u201cand for this effort to be financially feasible, a public-private partnership addressing predictable taxes and necessary infrastructure funding for public uses is essential.\u201d\n\nIn response, Mayor Hayes said he is \u201cvery excited about this unique opportunity, and very appreciative that the Bears have chosen to make such a major investment in our community.\u201d\n\nSen. Gillespie said her property tax proposal has been met with \u201cradio silence\u201d from the Bears, but added \u201cI\u2019m glad to see that they\u2019ve reached the final step and that they\u2019re making a commitment, and I look forward to seeing how this all develops.\u201d\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Mark Walker, of Arlington Heights, was pleased with the deal and said lawmakers must work on Gillespie\u2019s bill to \u201cprotect the school districts, the residents and the small businesses from any harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis should be a benefit to all if we can work the right deal,\u201d he said Wednesday from the state Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaroline Kubzansky is a reporter for Pioneer Press.

            "text": "Players begin to warm up before a game between the Bears and Vikings at Soldier Field on Jan. 8, 2023. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune)\n\nWith less than two weeks to go before Chicago\u2019s election, Mayor Lori Lightfoot isn\u2019t laughing at the Bears anymore.\n\nHer first reaction to the team\u2019s interest in Arlington Heights was to mock the NFL franchise and encourage its leaders to \u201cfocus on putting a winning team on the field, beating the Packers finally and being relevant past October.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now that the Bears have dropped a land mine in front of the mayor\u2019s reelection campaign by closing on the former Arlington Heights racetrack property that they hope to transform into a modern stadium, Lightfoot faces a tough situation that\u2019s largely out of her control but will nevertheless draw criticism of her combative style.\n\nIf the Bears ultimately leave the city \u2014 which isn\u2019t a foregone conclusion, though Wednesday\u2019s closing of the suburban land deal is a significant step \u2014 Lightfoot runs the risk of being known as the mayor who lost the Bears. It\u2019s a lose-lose for the incumbent. Her initial, antagonistic remark in 2021 to the team exploring the former Arlington International racecourse property could be used against her by critics who argue that she could\u2019ve done more to keep the Bears from making a move. Her opponents have hammered her for it on the campaign trail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the weeks after the Bears started flirting with the suburbs, Lightfoot pivoted from ridiculing the team to demanding that they explain what they want from the city. She then created a special commission to explore potential ways to place a dome over Soldier Field and make it a more attractive option for the Bears. Lightfoot has never said how the city would pay for a $2.2 billion dome over Soldier Field, but has offered it as a potential option for the team instead of Arlington Heights.\n\nRealistically, there isn\u2019t much Lightfoot can do to keep the Bears from exiting to the suburbs. If the team can pull together the financing it needs, it\u2019s going to leave, and that has little to do with City Hall.\n\n[ [Don\u2019t miss] Bears finalize deal to buy Arlington Heights racetrack site for a new stadium, but issues remain before ground is broken ]\n\nBut that won\u2019t stop some people from blaming her anyway.\n\n\u201cThe plan that she came up with was a little \u2018too little, too late,\u2019 \u201d said Chicago political strategist Delmarie Cobb. \u201cThere\u2019s still a great deal of pride in being one of the original franchisees for the NFL, and to lose that to Arlington Heights, I mean, that\u2019s a wound.\u201d\n\nThe unfolding situation with the Bears has drawn mixed responses from rival candidates. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer have said the city should just let the Bears go, while former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas has stated: \u201cI think they\u2019re gone. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\nBusinessman Willie Wilson has made the unlikely suggestion of bringing another team to Chicago. State Rep. Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner and 4th Ward Ald. Sophia King have said the city should work to keep the Bears \u2014 but only to a certain point. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, meanwhile, said the team\u2019s departure seems assured \u201cdue in part to the defiant nature of the Lightfoot administration.\u201d\n\nAs the news broke Wednesday of the land closing, Lightfoot\u2019s campaign released a statement that lamented the development but also struck an optimistic tone.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s news \u2026 has been anticipated for some time. Nonetheless, all of us die-hard Bears fans, the mayor included, know and believe that the Chicago Bears should remain in Chicago,\u201d she said on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot speaks during a news conference announcing proposed changes to Soldier Field on July 25, 2022, at the Chicago stadium. Lightfoot unveiled plans for Soldier Field that could cost up to $2.2 billion as part of her ongoing campaign to keep the Bears from leaving town for Arlington Heights. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)\n\n\u201cSo now that the land deal has closed,\u201d Lightfoot\u2019s statement continued, \u201cwe have an even better opportunity to continue making the business case as to why the Bears should remain in Chicago and why adaptations to Soldier Field can meet and exceed the Bears\u2019 future needs.\u201d\n\nIf the Bears do leave, it\u2019s been clear from the beginning that Lightfoot would face blame from a segment of residents who would view that with the same revulsion reserved for the 2019 double-doink missed field goal. But the city doesn\u2019t have the money or available land to create the sort of modern stadium the Bears want, and she would also catch heat from good government enthusiasts if she suggested spending public money for the multibillion-dollar private franchise.\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago political science professor emeritus Christopher Mooney said that a few decades ago any sign of the Bears one day departing the city would have caused widespread heartbreak. But even die-hard Bears fans in the city might sympathize with the tough spot Lightfoot is in now after public opinion has begun to sour on sports teams getting sweetheart deals on the backs of taxpayers, he added.\n\n[ [Don\u2019t miss] Chicago Bears and Arlington Heights: What to know about the possible stadium move from Soldier Field ]\n\n\u201cThis game that these billionaires play with cities in which they own sports teams has gotten kind of old, right?\u201d Mooney said. \u201cThere\u2019s less sympathy than there once was. ... The reactions, as far as I can tell, have been a collective yawn. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge hue and cry. I don\u2019t see massive public outrage. I don\u2019t see the mayor going to the mat.\u201d\n\nBut Cobb said even if it would be politically fraught for the city to entice the Bears to stay in Chicago, Lightfoot should have been more diplomatic, given that revenue would be ceded to Arlington Heights should the team depart from Soldier Field.\n\n\u201cI just think that it was the accumulation of insults or slights the Bears felt from this mayor, and, of course, that\u2019s what her opponents are going to use against her because they\u2019re going to say, \u2018This is more of the same. And in this case, look at the results. We\u2019re losing a major asset.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans watch as players take the field before the Chicago Bears play the first quarter against the Houston Texans at Soldier Field on Sept. 25, 2022. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune)\n\nFounded in Decatur, the Bears moved to Chicago in 1921 and played at Wrigley Field for 50 years. In 1971, they shifted to Soldier Field, where the Chicago Park District became their landlord. The Bears pay $6.48 million per year under the current lease, which runs through 2033, but the team can exit early by paying a penalty.\n\nShould the Bears pack up and leave under Lightfoot\u2019s tenure, she will have been the first Chicago mayor to preside over the exodus of a major sports team in the city\u2019s modern history. In 1960, the NFL\u2019s Chicago Cardinals left for St. Louis before eventually settling in Phoenix. And Gov. James R. Thompson famously led the push for the Illinois General Assembly to approve a new tax-subsidized, $167 million White Sox stadium at literally the 11th hour to convince the Major League Baseball team to not pack up for St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nTwo decades ago, the Bears made a similar threat to leave Chicago. But back then, the team nabbed a deal with Mayor Richard M. Daley that contained a mostly taxpayer-subsidized $632 million renovation of Soldier Field, one of the largest government contributions in the history of professional sports.\n\nShould the Bears leave this time, Lightfoot will hardly be the only leader of a major city where fans are rooting for a team that doesn\u2019t technically play within city limits. Lightfoot often points out the New York Giants and Jets both play in New Jersey, the San Francisco 49ers are based in suburban Santa Clara and the L.A. Rams\u2019 new SoFi stadium is in Inglewood, California.\n\nAs for whether Lightfoot\u2019s ribbing of the Bears\u2019 latest record was a misstep, Mooney said the mayor was simply sharing a sentiment that other fans of the team know all too well.\n\n\u201cThat particular biting comment was not a comment that only her alone made,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cI bet there\u2019s lots of people in the city of Chicago who were saying the same thing: \u2018Who cares? If you ever win a game every now and then, maybe we\u2019ll care about you \u2014 1985 was a long time ago.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to clarify mayoral candidate Paul Vallas\u2019 stance on the Bears leaving.",

            "text": "ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) \u2014 The Chicago Bears on Wednesday bought the property that they\u2019ve been sizing up for a new enclosed stadium in suburban Arlington Heights.\n\nThe Bears announced that they paid $197.2 million for the 326-acre plot.\n\nThe team cautioned, however, that the purchase doesn\u2019t mean plans for a new stadium and an entertainment district will come to fruition.\n\n\u201cThere is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible,\u201d the Bears said in a statement.\n\nSoldier Field on Chicago\u2019s lakefront has been the Bears\u2019 home since 1971. The team played at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970, and if a new stadium is constructed, the franchise would have its name on the mortgage for the first time since arriving in Chicago.\n\nEconomic analysts have said building a Bears entertainment district would create more than 48,000 jobs and generate $9.4 billion for the local economy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Bears will continue to work closely alongside the Village of Arlington Heights, surrounding municipalities and their residents to solicit extensive feedback on how we can best benefit local communities and Bears fans across Illinois,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis planning will include a robust diversity, equity and inclusion program that prioritizes local hiring throughout every stage of the development.\u201d\n\nThe Bears envision restaurants, retail and more on the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field \u2014 all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears plan to pay for their stadium, but want taxpayer dollars to cover infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers.\n\nThe city of Chicago proposed last summer enclosing Soldier Field and increasing its capacity from a league-low 61,500. But the Bears have insisted the only possibilities they were considering were for the Arlington Heights site.\n\nIt will be up to new president and CEO Kevin Warren to help the Bears\u2019 vision for a new home become a reality. He was hired last month after spending three years as commissioner of the Big Ten.\n\nWarren, who\u2019s replacing the retiring Ted Phillips, worked in the NFL for more than two decades. He was part of Minnesota\u2019s front office from 2005-19, ascending to chief operating officer in 2015, and played a big role in the Vikings\u2019 construction of U.S. Bank Stadium.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Bears see that stadium, which opened in 2016, as a model for their potential new home, with its translucent roof and massive glass panels letting in enough light and air to make fans feel as if they\u2019re outdoors.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

Our goal is to work together to create a new regional destination befitting of the great legacy of the property.\u201d\n\nChicago Wants Bears to Stay in City\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has previously said the city will work hard to keep the Bears at Soldier Field, the lakefront stadium in the city. The current lease on that site runs through the 2033 season. A clause in that agreement would allow the team to buy out the lease in 2027 for $84 million.\n\nSoldier Field was last renovated more than 20 years ago. That work has been widely panned, as it placed a modern stadium on top of what was a historic landmark.\n\nWith a capacity of just 61,500, Soldier Field is the smallest stadium in the NFL.\n\nThe Bears have envisioned building an enclosed stadium at Arlington Park, a venue that could lead to it landing major events like the Super Bowl and the Final Four.\n\nIf it proceeds with the project, the team said it would serve as one of the largest megaprojects ever in the Midwest. The team said an economic impact study showed construction across the site would create more than 48K jobs and a $9.4 billion boost to the regional economy.\n\nOnce completed, the site would create more than 9,750 jobs, the team said in its Wednesday statement. Those jobs would likely generate more than $600 million in worker income, meaning the jobs would have an average salary in excess of $61K.\n\n\u201cThe project would offer considerable commercial and residential real estate opportunities year-round, and serve as a regional hub for entertainment, shopping, and community events that complement the established businesses and thriving community already in place,\u201d the team claimed.\n\nArlington Money to Help Finance P2E Purchase\n\nCDI said in its statement that it intends to use the proceeds from the Arlington Park sale toward the purchase of gaming and racing properties it acquired last year from Peninsula Pacific Gaming.\n\nChurchill purchased the Del Lago Resort in Waterloo, NY, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Sioux City, Iowa, Colonial Downs in New Kent, Va., and six historical horse racing (HHR) properties in Virginia. The $2.75 billion deal also includes rights to build additional HHR parlors in Virginia and the rights to build a casino in Richmond, Va.\n\nArlington\u2019s future as the Bears stadium isn\u2019t the only uncertainty related to the deal.\n\nArlington Park was one of three thoroughbred racetracks in Illinois, with races taking place there during the spring and summer. When CDI shuttered the historic venue, company officials said they were interested in opening another facility in the state.\n\nHowever, Bob Denneen, projects manager for the Illinois Racing Board, told Casino.org Wednesday that Churchill no longer has a racing license in the state, and if it were to propose a new track, the company would have to apply for a new license.\n\nA message to a Churchill Downs spokesperson was not immediately returned Wednesday evening.",

            "text": "For those of you who didn't know, I had the privilege of spending last week in Arizona mingling with many media and NFL-types at Super Bowl Radio Row.\n\nFor those of you who want to hear about that week in more detail, you can check it out here.\n\nIf you are someone that gets into meeting celebrities and athletes, that's definitely the best part of the week, but if you are more someone that just wants to hear interesting nuggets about teams, there's plenty of that during Super Bowl week as well.\n\nWhen there are NFL events, that's when people get together and talk. Senior Bowl is one. The Super Bowl is another. The combine is arguably the best rumor mill of the year.\n\nWith the Chicago Bears being the big player this NFL offseason, there were some rumbles about what may happen. Here's what some Chicago Bears were saying, and here's what some other NFL-types were saying about the Monsters of the Midway last week in Arizona.\n\nContract Extensions\n\nThere aren't many names popping up for contract extensions right now. Cole Kmet, Jaylon Johnson and Darnell Mooney were the only names that surfaced in this regard and really are the only ones that should (David Montgomery is a free agent and doesn't count).\n\nI spoke with Cole Kmet personally, and he expressed his desire to return to the Chicago Bears and receive a contract extension. Ryan Poles has also publicly expressed the importance of Cole Kmet to this team moving forward. Kmet wasn't firm if contract talks had already begun but did tell me, \"I'm sure they have.\" Kmet's extension isn't going to be cheap. His could be north of Dawson Knox's contract (4 years, $52 million).\n\nI did hear that a Darnell Mooney extension is also something the Bears would like to get done but didn't hear much on parameters. Mooney is a tricky contract to figure out. Bears fans know how valuable he is to this offense and the connection he has with Justin Fields, but from a statistical standpoint, his numbers certainly don't scream WR1. Mooney has only had one season above 1,000 receiving yards, and he only has 10 career touchdowns. That may mean Mooney and the Bears may be pretty far apart on parameters. It'll be interesting to see if Mooney wants something close to $20 million annually and how far the Bears are willing to come up to meet him.\n\nJaylon Johnson, I think, is going to be interesting. It was very telling that Poles failed to mention Johnson as a blue-chip player moving forward at his year-end press conference. Johnson was also at radio row and did a couple of interviews saying that he not only wants an extension in Chicago, but his team has already engaged with the Bears on a contract extension. I think, currently these two sides are pretty far off. I don't think Johnson will accept a discount to get an extension done, but I'm not sure the Bears are willing to pay Johnson like a lockdown CB1. Johnson has missed 11 games in 3 seasons, he only has one career interception, and while his completion % against is pretty low, according to Pro Football Reference, he has given up 11 career touchdowns, and his passer rating against is above 100. This will be one to watch.\n\nFree Agency\n\nThe best free agency rumors start leaking out at the NFL combine, but there was already some chatter in Arizona. I spoke with Bobby Okereke, and I get the feeling that the Bears are definitely going to be in the mix here. He expressed an interest in being comfortable with coaches and scheme, and when he spoke about Matt Eberflus and Justin Fields, he had a pretty big smile on his face. I could see the Bears go into next year with Okereke and Jack Sanborn as the WILL and the MIKE.\n\nI think the one thing everyone agrees on is that the Bears are going to sign a right tackle. Which one was up for debate, but a right tackle might be number one on their priority board. Plenty of names surfaced: Mike McGlinchey, Caleb McGary, Juwaan Taylor, and even Orlando Brown (I can't see that one personally). I think we will definitely see some movement there early in free agency.\n\nI didn't hear anything specific tying the Bears to defensive line, but there was plenty of talk about Daron Payne and his future. There is no consensus as to what's going to happen here. Plenty think that Washington will figure out a way to give him the franchise tag, but many don't see a path for Washington to pay both him and Jonathan Allen (I'm one of them). If Payne is allowed to hit free agency, he's going to have plenty of suitors. If Payne wants to go to a winner (Micah Parsons is already recruiting him to come to Dallas), he won't be looking at the Bears, but if the Bears want to pay Payne north of $20 million annually, when the dust settles, they'll be able to offer him more money than anyone else. It'll be curious if Payne will want to take the big contract now and worry about winning later in his career.\n\nTrades\n\nIf the Bears make a trade this offseason, it's most likely going to be for a wide receiver. At this point, no one really knows what wide receivers are going to become available, but the one name that came up a few times is Tee Higgins. Higgins has over 3,000 yards receiving in his 3 NFL seasons, and the Cincinnati Bengals are in a tough spot knowing that they need to pay the farm to Joe Burrow, and Ja'Marr Chase is also probably going to cost them $30 million a year. The Bengals could do some creative accounting and use the franchise tag and keep that trio together for a couple more seasons, but if they do that, they will eventually lose Higgins for nothing. If they want to get something solid in return for Higgins, this is the offseason to move him.\n\nContrary to what Jason LaCanfora has tweeted, I didn't hear one, and I mean, not one person, even suggest that the Bears might still be willing to trade Justin Fields. The Bears are not drafting a quarterback, and the Bears definitely want to trade down from number one. The market for the number one pick is interesting. Some think the Bears won't be able to get the king's ransom like some are hoping, but others, like Adam Schefter, told Bears fans to dream big about how much they can get in return for the pick.\n\nIf the Bears stay in the top 4 or 5, the lean seems to be Jalen Carter over Will Anderson, but obviously, that's really early in the draft process. I think many people are circling the Indianapolis Colts as the biggest potential trade partner, but I think that's more connecting the dots than it is any verifiable information.\n\nIf Bryce Young was about 3 inches taller and about 30 pounds heavier, I think that pick would be really juicy, but right now, teams know that Young is the best quarterback on tape, but there are going to be concerns about giving up multiple picks for a quarterback some feel is too small to succeed at the NFL level. Will Levis and Anthony Richardson are going to be guys that are going to climb boards after the combine, and CJ Stroud seems to be the \"highest floor, lowest ceiling\" guy of the group (a safe pick).\n\nNFL free agency is just a month away. The Bears are going to be right in the thick of it. It's going to be a fun ride, Bears fans, so buckle up.\n\nBe sure to follow Bill on Twitter @ZimmermanSXM for any other news or rumors he hears.",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears move back in Todd McShay\u2019s latest 2023 NFL mock draft on ESPN\n\nWe are still two months away from the 2023 NFL draft and all the talk will continue to surround the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe Bears hold the No. 1 pick in the draft but aren\u2019t expected to keep it. Instead, many expect the Bears to trade the No. 1 pick hoping to land more assets in the draft to build the franchise in a key year for a rebuild.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN analyst Todd McShay released his updated 2023 mock draft and he\u2019s echoing those thoughts of the Bears trading back. McShay has the Indianapolis Colts moving up from No. 4 overall to No. 1 and taking a quarterback. Here is what McShay wrote on the situation including the haul the Bears get back:\n\nIndianapolis has entered each of the past five seasons with a different starting quarterback, opting for veteran options via free agency and trades. But it was No. 27 in Total QBR last season (36.8), and the offense was at the bottom of the NFL in points per game (15.8). GM Chris Ballard will be eager to jump the line to land the top quarterback on the Colts\u2019 board, whomever that ends up being. And the Bears should be listening to offers. They have their quarterback in Justin Fields and can still land a standout defensive player in a trade-back \u2014 while also picking up additional draft capital. Matt Miller actually projected the Colts to move up to No. 1 in his mock last week, too. It just makes sense.\n\nThe return could come down to just how desperate the QB-needy teams get and how much they fall in love with a specific passer. But I\u2019d expect the Bears to receive something in the ballpark of the No. 4 pick, a second-rounder (No. 35), a fifth-rounder and maybe even an additional Round 1 selection in 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s an ideal situation for the Chicago Bears to trade back and Indianapolis feels like a legit candidate. But the haul from McShay feels a little underwhelming.\n\nChicago gets No. 35 overall as a second round pick plus a fifth-rounder. McShay mentions they could get an addition first rounder. The perfect scenario for Ryan Poles is getting another first rounder next year as it would be a valuable pick to have for next year.\n\nThe Chicago Bears would get back the No. 4 pick and they take Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter. The defensive tackle would fill a big need for the Bears on the defensive line as Will Anderson went No. 3 to Arizona.\n\nFor More Great Chicago Sports Content\n\nFollow us on Twitter at @chicitysports23 for more great content.

            "text": "The Chicago Bears may or may not move to Arlington Heights, but the team is now a huge landowner in the village.\n\nThe Bears said Wednesday that they have acquired the 326-acre former Arlington International Racecourse as a potential site for a new stadium and a \u201cmultipurpose entertainment district.\u201d Bears spokesman Scott Hagel confirmed the sale by Churchill Downs was for $197.2 million, a deal that severs the 95-year-old track\u2019s connection to the horse racing business.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, the Bears emphasized that buying the site provides no certainty of a new stadium. The acquisition, however, could put pressure on Chicago officials trying to keep the Bears at Soldier Field and on Arlington Heights officials who are being asked for tax subsidies.\n\nIt also means that if the Bears stay in Chicago, they\u2019ll own a huge asset in Arlington Heights they wouldn\u2019t need after all.\n\n\u201cFinalizing the purchase does not guarantee the land will be developed, but it is an important next step in our ongoing evaluation of the opportunity,\u201d the team said. \u201cThere is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multipurpose entertainment district is feasible.\u201d\n\nIts statement went on to extol the projected $9.4 billion in economic benefits for the Chicago area and to reiterate that the Bears want no tax help for the stadium itself, just for other development on the property. Still to be seen is whether that argument will mean much in Arlington Heights and surrounding towns, where residents have voiced concerns about traffic, crowds and the impact on local schools if the development includes new residences. Others have voiced support for having the Bears nearby.\n\nThe village has hired a consultant to review the Bears\u2019 economic projections. A bill in Springfield backed by some business groups would let the Bears negotiate annual property tax payments to local governments rather than see the bills rise dramatically as the site is developed.\n\nThe Bears have emphasized they need \u201cproperty tax certainty\u201d to pursue the development. They\u2019ve also issued their analysis of the purported benefits of the tax legislation.\n\nThe team said, \u201cThe overarching plan will work only if the Village of Arlington Heights, surrounding municipalities, Cook County, greater Chicagoland and the State of Illinois all receive significant economic benefits, and we are confident a megaproject like this can deliver.\u201d\n\nArlington Heights Mayor Thomas Hayes said, \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about this unique opportunity and very appreciative that the Bears have chosen to make a major investment in our community.\u201d\n\nHayes said the village will work to make sure residents don\u2019t bear the burden of any tax incentives for the Bears. On that basis, Hayes said, he believes most members of the Village Board also support the project. In November, the village approved a predevelopment agreement with the Bears, setting out general rules for pursuing the development but making no guarantees.\n\nThe Bears emphasized that they will continue a five-monthlong process of engaging area residents and government officials in developing any plans.\n\nThe statement concluded: \u201cWhile this closing marks a major development in the ongoing evaluation, there has been no decision that the development of the recently acquired property will occur. But today\u2019s news is nonetheless an exciting update and positions our state and the Chicagoland region to be able to host world-class entertainment and sporting events on an unprecedented scale.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing this evaluation with the Village of Arlington Heights, surrounding governmental bodies and the General Assembly in the coming months, and conveying what we believe is necessary to transform the recently purchased, largely dormant Arlington Heights property into one of the most iconic megaproject entertainment and destination points in the world.\u201d\n\nRelated Lightfoot floats idea of a dome over Soldier Field\n\nAt Soldier Field, the Bears have a lease that expires in 2033. The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority has said taxpayers still owe $631 million on notes issued to pay for Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation.\n\nJay Rembert, 41, who has been a fan of the Bears since he was a child, said he loved the move, and though he still has fond feelings about Soldier Field, he thinks the team has outgrown the stadium\u2019s current layout.\n\n\u201cI love it! No offense to Soldier Field, but it\u2019s very congested and condensed in that area,\u201d Rembert said. \u201cI think the new stadium would be beneficial for every Bears fan, not to mention more seats for more fans to celebrate.\u201d\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration has responded to the team\u2019s Arlington Heights overtures with plans to improve Soldier Field and add a roof to it, work that city officials said could be done at far less cost to the Bears than a new stadium elsewhere.\n\nThe plan was seen by some as a Hail Mary pass to keep the Bears. The city has offered a plan with an estimated cost of $2.2 billion but hasn\u2019t said how the money would be raised.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office said the news about the Bears\u2019 land acquisition closing was expected and in some ways is good for the city\u2019s interests. The Bears could not negotiate with Chicago while the Arlington Heights sale was pending.\n\nA statement from Lightfoot\u2019s office said: \u201cAll of us die-hard Bears\u2019 fans, the Mayor included, know and believe that the Chicago Bears should remain in Chicago. So, now that the land deal has closed, we have an even better opportunity to continue making the business case as to why the Bears should remain in Chicago and why adaptations to Soldier Field can meet and exceed all of the Bear\u2019s future needs. There is simply no doubt that the economic benefits for the team of staying in a reimagined Soldier Field significantly outweigh those gained in a move to the suburbs.\n\n\u201cDue to the Bears\u2019 legal restrictions in the pre-purchase phase, the City was unable to engage in direct negotiations with the Bears while the land was under contract. Now that the deal has been completed, we look forward to negotiating and convincing the Bears that the team\u2019s best future remains in our beloved city of Chicago.\u201d\n\nChicagoan Marc Ganis has advised numerous NFL teams on their stadium financing. He has closely followed the Bears stadium saga for decades, including former team President Michael McCaskey\u2019s flirtations with sites in Gary, Indiana; Hoffman Estates; the Near West Side; and the ill-fated McDome project adjacent to McCormick Place.\n\nGanis said he was \u201cnot the least\u201d bit surprised that the Bears closed on the racetrack. He said the recent decision to hire Kevin Warren as president and chief executive of the Bears, replacing retiring CEO Ted Phillips, made that decision almost a given.\n\nAs chief operating officer of the Minnesota Vikings, Warren oversaw construction of the Vikings\u2019 $1.13 billion U.S. Bank Stadium. The domed stadium was the largest public-private construction project in Minnesota history.\n\n\u201cThe Bears buying the land, closing on the land, tells us three key factors,\u201d Ganis said. \u201cNo. 1, they absolutely want to build a stadium there. No. 2, they\u2019ve done the initial environmental and land-use evaluations, and they\u2019ve come out fine. And No. 3, they feel they\u2019re gonna get at least local political support sufficient to be able to build the stadium and the ancillary development.\u201d\n\nGanis said he has viewed the Arlington Heights stadium as a \u201cdone deal\u201d ever since the Bears \u201csigned a contract for the option\u201d to purchase the land.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t obstacles to overcome.\n\n\u201cYou could have a recession \u2014 a massive recession. You could have COVID. Construction prices could skyrocket. We could have another \u201908 or \u201909 banking crisis,\u201d Ganis said. \u201cThere are lots of things that could delay it. But arguably there aren\u2019t many things that would deny it.\u201d\n\nContributing: Emmanuel Camarillo",

City officials have negotiated with team leaders to keep the Bears in Chicago and the Bears still need buy-in from suburban leaders and would-be neighbors.\n\n\u201cFinalizing the purchase does not guarantee the land will be developed, but it is an important next step in our ongoing evaluation of the property,\u201d team officials tweeted.\n\n\u201cThere is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible.\u201d\n\nThe closing is a \u201cmajor development\u201d in the possible move, but \u201cthere has been no decision\u201d on if the Bears will create the proposed Arlington Heights venue, according to a letter from the team.\n\nBut if the team does continue with its idea for the suburban campus, it \u201cwould be one of the largest mega-projects in Midwest history,\u201d according to the letter.\n\nOur open letter regarding the closing on Arlington Park property: \u2014 Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) February 15, 2023\n\nThe Arlington Park campus would be built on 326 acres at the site of the former Churchill Downs-owned racetrack that closed for racing at the end of last season.\n\nIt would be \u201cmuch more than a stadium project,\u201d the team wrote in September when showing off potential plans for the development.\n\nRELATED: Bears Reveal What Arlington Heights Stadium Campus Could Look Like\n\nThe campus would include a \u201cmulti-purpose entertainment, commercial/retail and housing district,\u201d according to the Bears website. It could include restaurants, office space, a hotel, fitness center, parks and open spaces.\n\nBut the website repeatedly noted the campus will only become reality if certain things happen: if the team closes on the property and if the team decides to develop it.\n\nNow, the team has finalized that first step.\n\nThe Bears have said the development could create more than 48,000 jobs and generate $9.4 billion for the Chicago-area economy. But company officials have said they\u2019d want public funding for the project.\n\n\u201cThe overarching plan will work only if the Village of Arlington Heights, surrounding municipalities, Cook County, greater Chicagoland and the State of Illinois all receive significant economic benefits, and we are confident a mega-project like this can deliver,\u201d according to the team\u2019s letter.\n\nThe team has hosted meetings with Arlington Heights residents to get their feedback. A September meeting attracted more than 100 neighbors who applauded when the Bears said their Arlington Heights stadium would have a roof \u2014 only for the crowd to groan when the team said the roof wouldn\u2019t be retractable.\n\nChicago officials have hoped they can keep the team at Soldier Field during months-long negotiations.\n\nThe announcement is the latest twist in the stadium drama between the Bears and the city of Chicago \u2014 a saga that dates back to the \u201970s, when the team first threatened to leave Soldier Field for Arlington Heights.\n\nThe city and the Bears rebuilt Soldier Field in 2002, but it remains the smallest capacity stadium in the NFL. And the Bears are tenants of the Park District, meaning they pay rent and split many of the revenue streams.\n\nLightfoot has tried to convince the team to stay by offering to build a dome over the stadium, but many saw it as a Hail Mary with little chance of keeping the team within the city limits.\n\nSeparately, Landmark Development also has proposed a glittering overhaul of Soldier Field, publicizing a nearly six-minute video in January showcasing designs to address many of the complaints the Bears have had about the stadium.\n\nLightfoot\u2019s office said at the time the mayor supported the developer\u2019s effort.\n\nBut the mayor also has tried to play hard ball at times, poking fun at the team\u2019s struggles on the field and suggesting how Soldier Field could be redeveloped without the Bears. She\u2019s also hinted Chicago would lure another football team to the city if the Bears left.\n\nThe Bears moved into the Park District-owned Soldier Field in 1971 but threatened a move to Arlington Heights several years later. Then-Mayor Richard J. Daley threatened to sue to block them from calling themselves the Chicago Bears if they moved. His son, Mayor Richard M. Daley, also had years of tense negotiations with the team, who threatened to move to Gary, Indiana, in 1995.\n\nThe Bears could break the Soldier Field lease as soon as 2026 by paying an $84 million penalty to the city, the Tribune has reported. That price tag goes down in future years.\n\nBig city teams opting for more room in the suburbs is not unprecedented. The New York Giants and New York Jets moved out of the city decades ago for New Jersey. The San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Commanders also play outside the cities they\u2019re named after.\n\nSubscribe to Block Club Chicago, an independent, 501(c)(3), journalist-run newsroom.

            "text": "Seven months after Mayor Lori Lightfoot launched a Hail Mary pass to keep the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, the team announced Wednesday it had finalized its purchase of the former Arlington Park racetrack, increasing the likelihood that the team will leave Chicago.\n\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors\n\nThat means the once mighty but more recently mediocre \u2013 or worse \u2013 National Football League franchise is on the verge of leaving its home of 51 years.\n\nBears officials announced in September that the team had reached an agreement to buy the 326-acre property for $197.2 million, leaving no doubt that the Monsters of the Midway see the city\u2019s northwest suburbs as the spot where they want to launch a \u201cnew and exciting chapter\u201d for the storied franchise.\n\n\u201cFinalizing the purchase does not guarantee the land will be developed, but it is an important next step in our ongoing evaluation of the opportunity,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cThere is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes less than two weeks before Lightfoot will ask Chicago voters to giver her a second term as Chicago mayor. The eight candidates who have challenged Lightfoot\u2019s bid for reelection have all said the Bears\u2019 looming departure would be a blow to the city and several blamed Lightfoot\u2019s antagonistic approach to the football team.\n\nState Rep. Kam Buckner and Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), whose districts include the stadium, have urged the city to keep the Bears from moving out of Chicago.\n\nBut both former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson have said the Bears have already decided to leave Chicago, with Johnson blaming \u201cthe defiant nature of the Lightfoot administration.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office in a statement downplayed the importance of the announcement made by the Bears, saying it had been \u201canticipated for some time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonetheless, all us diehard Chicago Bears fans, the mayor included, know and believe that the Chicago Bears should remain in Chicago,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nLightfoot will continue to make the \u201cbusiness case as to why the Bears should remain in Chicago and why adaptations to Soldier Field can meet and exceed all of the Bears\u2019 future needs,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe Bears pay $6.48 million annually to use Soldier Field, under the terms of a lease set to expire in 2033 that can be terminated early as long as the team pays a penalty.\n\nIn September, Lightfoot unveiled plans that would build a dome over the lakefront stadium and expand its seating capacity, and offered to use at least some taxpayer money to fund the renovations, which could cost as much as $2.2 billion.\n\nAfter Lightfoot unveiled her administration\u2019s plans for the stadium, a team spokesperson gave no indication Bears officials had any intention of rethinking their plan to make Arlington Heights the team\u2019s new home.\n\nHowever, the mayor\u2019s office said now that the deal has closed and the Bears are no longer prohibited from considering other stadium locations, they believe team officials will enter into negotiations with the city, giving Lightfoot a chance to convince \u201cthe Bears that the team\u2019s best future remains in our beloved city of Chicago.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear why the mayor believes the leaders of the Bears would consider scraping their plans to move to Arlington Heights after finalizing its purchase on the property and while attempting to convince state officials to subsidize the project, which includes shops, restaurants and event venues.\n\nWhen news first broke of the team\u2019s serious consideration of the move to the suburbs, Lightfoot brushed off the threat, urging the team to \u201cfocus on putting a winning team on the field, beating the Packers finally and being relevant past October.\u201d\n\nLightfoot has said regardless of whether the Bears leave Soldier Field, she wants to make the stadium a \u201cyear-round destination.\u201d While one of the city\u2019s proposals would put a dome over the stadium, the another would prepare the stadium for a dome while a final proposal would tailor the stadium for soccer.\n\nThe city\u2019s proposal would expand the stadium\u2019s seating capacity from 61,500 seats up to 70,000 \u201ctotal seats including additional fan activation areas\u201d and add seven suites, according to the mayor\u2019s office. The plan would also make it easier to get to Soldier Field via public transportation with shuttles and trams.\n\nSolider Field opened in 1924, and was last renovated in 2003 under a plan approved by former Mayor Richard M. Daley after the last time the Bears threatened to leave the city. That project was funded with $660 million in bonds that are being paid off with taxes paid by city hotels.\n\nIn February, approximately $415 million of that debt remained on the books of the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority in 2022, according to a report in the online publication Bond Buyer.\n\nA plan for the future of the Museum Campus, crafted by a working group formed by the mayor, sees Soldier Field and the entire Museum Campus as an essential destination for tourists and a hub for residents.\n\nPlans to build a dome over Solider Field could invite a legal challenge over the city\u2019s Lakefront Protection Ordinance, which does not allow \u201cfurther private development be permitted east of Lake Shore Drive.\u201d\n\nWatchdog group Friends of the Parks used that ordinance to sue the city when former Mayor Rahm Emanuel proposed building the Lucas Museum in what is now a parking lot near Soldier Field. After the group won an initial round in court, Star Wars creator George Lucas dropped his plans in 2016 and built the museum in Los Angeles.\n\nContact Heather Cherone: @HeatherCherone | (773) 569-1863 | [email protected]\n\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors",

            "text": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. \u2014 The Chicago Bears have taken another major step towards building a new stadium in the suburbs.\n\nThe Chicago Bears have announced that they have closed on the Arlington Park property. @WGNNews pic.twitter.com/MlB99J1bm5 \u2014 Larry Hawley (@HawleySports) February 15, 2023\n\nOn Wednesday, the team confirmed that they have closed on the Arlington Park property which they initially placed a purchase agreement on in September 2021. It marks the team\u2019s biggest step so far in making a move out of the City of Chicago in their efforts to build a new domed stadium in the northwest suburbs.\n\nThe 326-acre site is the former home of the Arlington Park race track, which was closed in the fall of 2021.\n\n\u201cFinalizing the purchase does not guarantee the land will be developed, but it is an important next step in our ongoing evaluation of the opportunity,\u201d said the team in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThere is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible.\u201d\n\nIf they do complete this, it will mark their first permanent home outside of the city limits since moving from Decatur after the 1920 season. From 1921 through 1970 they played at Wrigley Field and have called Soldier Field home since 1971. That venue underwent a major remodel in 2002 and the majority of 2003, with the Bears playing their home games for the 2002 & 2003 preseason at Memorial Stadium in Champaign.\n\n\u201cWhile this closing marks a major development in the ongoing evaluation, there has been no decision that the development of the recently acquired property will occur. But today\u2019s news is nonetheless an exciting update and positions our state and the Chicagoland region to be able to host world-class entertainment and sporting events on an unprecedented scale,\u201d said the Bears in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this evaluation with the Village of Arlington Heights, surrounding governmental bodies and the General Assembly in the coming months, and conveying what we believe is necessary to transform the recently purchased, largely dormant Arlington Heights property into one of the most iconic mega-project entertainment and destination points in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Village of Arlington Heights released a statement shortly after the team announced that they had closed on the property.\n\n\u201cThe Village of Arlington Heights is very excited about this unique opportunity and appreciative that the CBFC has chosen to make such a major investment in our community. However, we have an obligation to ensure that any project proposed will be in the best interests of our residents before any approvals are granted. Over the coming months and years, we look forward to working with the CBFC, our residents, and all other stakeholders in an open and transparent manner, while we work to explore the potential opportunities this development could bring to our region. Our goal is to work together to create a new regional destination befitting of the great legacy of the property.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Chicago Bears\n\nCourtesy Chicago Bears\n\nCourtesy Chicago Bears\n\nThis continues the process that was started 17 months ago when the team put a purchase agreement in for the property. One year later, in September 2022 the team revealed potential designs for the property that not only called for a domed stadium but also a multi-purpose entertainment, commercial/retail, and housing district in the area.\n\nWhen announcing the details of this new development, they released potential economic impact numbers as well.\n\nConstruction\n\n48,000 jobs\n\n$9.4 billion economic impact on Chicagoland area\n\n$3.9 billion in annual labor income for the region\n\nAfter Completion\n\n9,750 long-term jobs\n\n$1.4 billion of economic impact on Chicagoland area\n\n$601 million annual labor income for the region\n\nAnnual Tax Revenue\n\n$16 million in Arlington Heights\n\n$9.8 million for Cook County\n\n$51.3 million for State of Illinois\n\nFrom the start, the Bears have said they\u2019d pay fully for the new stadium but would need help on other parts of the project, a position which they reiterated today.\n\n\u201cWe have publicly stated and repeat here again: If we construct a state-of-the-art stadium, we will not seek taxpayer funds locally or otherwise for the structure. If we proceed, however, this project would require assistance to ensure feasibility, including our securing property tax certainty and support for infrastructure commensurate with the public benefits the project will yield to the region,\u201d said the Bears in their statement. \u201cFor the development to move forward, and for this effort to be financially feasible, a public-private partnership addressing predictable taxes and necessary infrastructure funding for public uses is essential. Public funds for infrastructure will provide regional improvements such as roads for better traffic flow and water drainage for residents throughout the area.\n\n\u201cThis support, along with the team\u2019s investment, will be crucial to ensuring the local and Illinois economies receive a dramatic, long-lasting influx of investment and new tax revenue of a magnitude never experienced before in the region.\u201d",

            "text": "The team confirmed it closed on the $197 million acquisition today, almost 17 months after signing a purchase agreement with longtime track owner Churchill Downs.\n\nThe deal clears the way for the Bears to forge ahead with Arlington Heights officials on a litany of planning processes that would allow the team to transform the 326-acre property, and increases the likelihood that the team will ultimately leave Soldier Field behind after more than five decades at the lakefront stadium. But the team issued a statement today noting it is still far from certain that it will move forward with the Arlington Heights project.\n\n\"Finalizing the purchase does not guarantee the land will be developed, but it is an important next step in our ongoing evaluation of the opportunity,\" the team wrote in an open letter to the public. \"There is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible.\"\n\nThe purchase comes as the Bears make a push in Springfield for legislation that would potentially entitle the team to millions of dollars in tax subsidies for its megaproject under a tax break known as payment in lieu of taxes, or PILT. The measure would freeze property taxes on the Bears' site for at least 20 years, with new tax revenue above that from the new development being used to reimburse the team for certain expenses, similar to a tax-increment financing district. But unlike TIFs, the property tax payment owed by the Bears would be pre-negotiated, rather than tied to a property's appraised value, and proceeds would be split among the Bears and local taxing agencies. Such a district would give the team more predictability when it comes to its future tax bills.\n\nThe Bears have said for months that they would not seek taxpayer funding for a new stadium structure itself, but that they would need public help to build out new infrastructure for the planned entertainment campus around the venue \u2014 a project the team expects to generate billions of dollars in local economic impact.\n\nThe Bears reiterated that point in the letter today, saying the project \"would require assistance to ensure feasibility, including our securing property tax certainty and support for infrastructure commensurate with the public benefits the project will yield to the region. For the development to move forward, and for this effort to be financially feasible, a public-private partnership addressing predictable taxes and necessary infrastructure funding for public uses is essential.\"",
