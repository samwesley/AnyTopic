            "text": "While gloomy economic forecasts spell trouble for early-stage space firms in 2023, analysts say the industry as a whole should largely prove resilient to any downturn.\n\nSpace businesses are more agile than ever in responding to changing market conditions, and governments worldwide are expected to continue underpinning growth for many of them, even as private funding sources dry up.\n\nHowever, even those able to weather harsh financial climates will face operational challenges and dampened growth prospects this year.\n\n2022 was marred by economic uncertainty. Soaring inflation, supply chain disruption, energy price hikes, and other headwinds contributed to an unstable and uneven recovery for markets still battling the lingering effects of COVID-19.\n\nAnd forecasters are painting another year of uncertainty for 2023 as the pandemic and ongoing war in Ukraine cloud the outlook.\n\nIn the U.S., which is easily the largest player in the space economy, signs of economic growth are complicated by sky-high inflation and extremely low consumer confidence.\n\nAfter a series of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve to slow down the country\u2019s runaway economy and keep the prices of goods in check, inflation has fallen from a 40-year high of 9% in June to around 7% in November \u2014 still far short of the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\nLower inflation would be good news for consumers; however, successive interest rate rises in the U.S. and elsewhere could push the macroeconomy closer to a global recession.\n\nEven if the U.S. manages to scrape through without entering a recession \u2014 technically two consecutive three-month periods of negative gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 businesses will have to grapple with a constrained and challenging economic environment.\n\nDuring an economic crisis, or when interest rates are rising, investors tend to pull out of riskier projects and focus on profitable or cash-generating businesses \u2014 which \u201cis not the case for a number of companies in the space industry today,\u201d notes Miguel Ouellette, a principal advisor at Euroconsult.\n\nAnd like in other industries, small and recent businesses in the space sector are more exposed to macroeconomic declines than more established companies.\n\nThe cost of borrowing money is deeply tied to how young companies are valued, and Ouellette expects their projects to be under threat if interest rates stay high.\n\nIt is \u201chighly likely\u201d early-stage investment rounds for these companies in 2023 will be fewer in number and smaller in size than in previous years.\n\nAccording to Analysys Mason research director Brad Grady, pre-revenue startups are already having challenges, \u201cespecially those with overtly optimistic business plans requiring significant technology development\u201d to create new markets with unproven business models.\n\n\u201cAny pre or early revenue company with a high cash burn rate looking to raise money is worried right now,\u201d Grady says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if the company is a launch company, an antenna manufacturer,\u201d or one just providing space-related services.\n\nThere was a noticeable drop in the number of growth stage funding rounds for the space sector in the second half of 2022 and the capital they were able to raise.\n\nThe challenges young space companies face can also be seen in the poor stock performance of those that listed via merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, as they trade well below their initial public offering (IPO) price.\n\nGOVERNMENT STRENGTH\n\nCompanies developing capital-intensive, hardware-heavy business models are probably more exposed to economic slumps than firms focusing on software, according to Grady.\n\nLikewise, purely commercial space businesses are more vulnerable to a downturn than companies with an extensive pipeline of government opportunities.\n\nNot only do governments offer a more robust source of funding to private players and academia, but they also act as customers of services for several commercial initiatives.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only increased demand from governments for Earth observation, cybersecurity, and other defense-related applications championed by the space industry. China\u2019s space advances are also encouraging governments to bolster these capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the increasing political importance globally of finding ways to tackle climate change is expected to be another boon for space-based technology.\n\nIn stark contrast to the share prices of young space companies that went public via a SPAC, traditional space firms in the aerospace and defense sector outperformed the broader stock market in 2022.\n\n\u201cTheoretically, when the global economy is going under uncertain times, governments tend to allocate their resources to their core functions, which sometimes lead to budgets cuts or delays for many projects,\u201d Euroconsult\u2019s Ouellette says.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to global government funding within the space sector, it grew by 8% between 2020 and 2021, which indicates a certain resilience for space projects.\u201d\n\nThis growth rate could have potentially been even higher if it wasn\u2019t for COVID-19, according to Ouellette, underlining how government stimuli and investments \u2013 or sound and flexible policies \u2014 can mitigate macroeconomic uncertainties for the private sector.\n\nDespite economic conditions that might slow the industry\u2019s growth, Euroconsult expects the global space economy to grow nearly 75% by 2030 to reach $642 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s partly due to how quickly the U.S. economy has historically bounced back after a recession.\n\nTHIS TIME IS DIFFERENT\n\nThe pandemic clogged supply chains, disrupted workforces, hampered travel, and weighed heavily on the space industry\u2019s commercial expansion.\n\nHowever, it also helped accelerate the sector\u2019s transition toward more digital solutions that save costs and makes businesses more nimble and responsive to customer demands.\n\nEfforts to virtualize ground segment hardware, for example, are helping satellite operators operate their networks remotely via third-party data centers, reducing costs while increasing their efficiency and compatibility with other cloud-based services.\n\nPhil Smith, a senior space analyst at BryceTech, believes the space industry\u2019s capacity for reinvention is a key lesson for charting how it could respond to a macroeconomic shock.\n\nIn just 60 years the industry has evolved from being confined to just two governments to consisting of a plethora of players, including over 60 countries and tens of thousands of companies.\n\nOver the decades, the industry has seen recoveries from downturns following Apollo and the Space Shuttle, commercialization following the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2014 something that effectively ended during the later Putin era, and the resurrection of low Earth orbit (LEO) broadband constellations from a \u201cbefore-their-time\u201d collapse in the late 1990s.\n\nThe industry has recently also revisited reusability and mass production capabilities that were often talked about before, sometimes pursued, but only now proving successful commercially.\n\n\u201cThis capacity for reinvention is bolstered by a greater number of players across the globe, a situation that promotes competition, striving for excellence, and many innovative approaches to problems,\u201d Smith adds.\n\nThe proliferation of LEO broadband networks, and the commercial space industry\u2019s general push into connectivity markets, also pose new opportunities and challenges.\n\nAs more systems are digitized across all industries, Grady notes how connectivity and technology are becoming \u201cfundamental building blocks of value in far more sectors than ever before.\u201d\n\nBoosted by the progress made in 2022 to standardize and integrate satellite and terrestrial communications, space-based data has also never been more available in volume and price.\n\n\u201cDigitalization is far more advanced across more levels of the space-value chain which is helping drive down unit economics and time to market,\u201d Grady says.\n\nHowever, there are downsides to space becoming \u201cless weird from the rest of the global economy,\u201d he adds, such as the highly public cyberattacks seen amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe more the industry moves to adopt terrestrial practices, the more it will see terrestrial problems impacting the sector,\u201d Grady predicts.\n\nCOVID-19 showed how a wider uptake of space-based services could be a drag on the industry in markets once considered robust against terrestrial market trends, like inflight connectivity, where demand plummeted as travel restrictions came into force.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nMuch will depend on decisions made this year by central banks, the output of global GDP, and the impacts of geopolitical tensions that can serve as a double-edged sword for the industry\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAside from business failures, challenging financial environments can lead to more mergers and acquisitions, which can improve business prospects but also dramatically change the state of play.\n\nDeal activity is already in full swing with multibillion-dollar acquisitions coming in right at the end of 2022 for Maxar Technologies and Aerojet Rocketdyne.\n\nMore huge acquisitions are expected this year \u2014 particularly by large space companies seeking capabilities complementary to their own as price tags fall for many businesses.\n\nEconomic headwinds could also push more companies to buy out suppliers and partners to save costs and reap operational synergies by reducing intermediaries.\n\nThis

            "text": "Share Article\n\nSenior U.S. military space and intelligence leaders drove home a clear and consistent message at a gathering of space industry and government officials Jan. 24: The Department of the Air Force and the intelligence community must move from a bloated, complicated acquisition process to one in which space systems can be fielded faster and better meet requirements.\n\nIn remarks at a conference held by the National Security Space Association, leaders from the Department of Air Force, Space Force, and intelligence community framed the issue in blunt terms.\n\n\u201cWe have a culture we have to break,\u201d undersecretary of the Air Force for space acquisitions and integration Frank Calvelli said.\n\nWhile Calvelli had some critiques of industry, he put much of the blame for issues he sees on the Department of Air Force\u2019s own lack of clarity on what it wants from specific space programs. Calvelli noted that the Pentagon often rethinks and modifies programs to fit the current budget, shifting scheduling and adding and removing capabilities.\n\nCalvelli has outlined clear goals for the way he wants the Department of Air Force to conduct business: shorter, three-year start-to-launch times, smaller systems, more use of commercial assets, and the use of fixed-price contacts to prod industry to deliver programs focused and on time.\n\n\u201cWe like to build new,\u201d Calvelli said. \u201cNew is cool. But we have to stop building new and take advantage of existing designs if we really want to drive schedules to be faster.\u201d\n\nCalvelli noted that he does not to hamstring future technologies, but he does want to increase speed in the acquisition process and proliferate the sources of America\u2019s space assets to complicate targeting for America\u2019s adversaries.\n\nHe pointed to his time as a senior official at the National Reconnaissance Office, which he said takes a more hardline approach to contracting than the Department of Defense\u2019s process, which defense leaders, experts, and elected officials have long said needs reform.\n\nOne common DOD practice Calvelli cautioned against is awarding contracts to the lowest bidder. He said the Department of the Air Force must take a hard look at whether contractors for its space projects can actually deliver before spending millions of dollars on a project that is ultimately canceled.\n\n\u201cYou get to the mode where you\u2019re just reviewing the proposal, and you don\u2019t take into account knowledge about the company, or you don\u2019t know about the company,\u201d Calvelli said. \u201cYou can end up awarding a significant space program to a part of a company or to a company that has absolutely no experience and no chance of actually executing the program.\u201d\n\nAnother of Calvelli\u2019s points of emphasis was moving towards as many commercial assets as feasible, both to take advantage of existing technology and proliferate the sources of America\u2019s space assets to complicate targeting for America\u2019s adversaries.\n\nCalvelli\u2019s views are shared across the military space enterprise, according to the deputy commander of U.S. Space Command.\n\nSPACECOM is focused on \u201cstaying in our lane,\u201d Lt. Gen. John E. Shaw told reporters, instead of \u201cunnecessarily or prematurely\u201d focusing on broad solutions that don\u2019t align with specific operational requirements, which may be more limited.\n\nSimilarly, as the Space Force enters its fourth year, it cannot lose sight of its core missions of maintaining and building systems that allow the entire U.S. military to fight, the service\u2019s deputy chief of space operations for intelligence said.\n\n\u201cKeep it simple, stupid,\u201d Space Force Maj. Gen. Gregory J. Gagnon said. \u201cLet\u2019s just do small things, do them really fast, and continue to move forward. I think that\u2019s absolutely the right way ahead.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials have noted that because space is a largely classified realm, frank discussion about issues with an asset can be limited.\n\nBut while Calvelli said he is sometimes frustrated with DOD\u2019s space acquisition process, one of the nation\u2019s most senior intelligence officials said some of the same issues extend to the rest of the federal government\u2019s national security enterprise.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that we have to figure out how to move faster in our acquisition realm,\u201d said Stacey Dixon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence.\n\nDixon noted the intelligence community is naturally risk-averse, methodical and still working out how to fix its processes.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to try to decrease the amount of time that it takes to do work with us and the amount of time that it takes for decisions to be made of which they\u2019re waiting on our input,\u201d Dixon said.",

Its findings were published in the Nature Scientific Reports Journal.\n\nBased on pre and post-scores of the users, the technology helped reduce their anxiety, and in particular, lowered depressive symptoms among participants with depression.\n\nThere were also improvements in their sensory processing which came with frequent usage.\n\nMost participants, the study noted, preferred the VR Sensory room with \"superior\" visual and sound experience, while those who prefer tactile sensory experiences still prefer a physical sensory room experience.\n\nBased on interviews, users valued the VR programme for its portability and usability during the pandemic. They also found the technology a value for money as it is cheaper than a traditional physical sensory space.\n\nMoreover, participants suggested a modification or removal of the headset and the adoption of a wireless version of the VR system; an inbuilt measure of user anxiety; and a technology that adapts to the user's interests.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nIn a research report, WSU highlighted the potential of VR to promote the implementation of sensory rooms as an effective intervention tool for persons with neurodevelopmental disabilities. As VR emerges as an assistive tool for a number of health and wellness activities, the researchers stressed the importance of evaluating its usage and benefits, which had been largely unexplored in previous studies.\n\n\"Our findings have shown that VR technology may offer a promising avenue for the provision of sensory interventions and an effective calming tool, with the most prominent benefit reported by users being a reduction in anxiety,\" said Dr Caroline Mills of the WSU School of Health Sciences and Translational Health Research Institute.\n\n\"Given the preliminary nature of this study, we are pursuing more robust future study designs to better understand the benefits and ensure the program can be used in real-life environments to support the people that need it,\" Danielle Tracey, professor and co-lead author from WSU, added.\n\nMARKET SNAPSHOT\n\nTwo Japanese firms in recent years have signed multi-million dollar deals to develop VR-based digital therapeutics that target mental health disorders. VR company Jolly Good and its partner Otsuka Pharmaceutical are working to expand the use of social skill training VR in treating mental disorders in Japan. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and US-based BehaVR are collaborating to develop prescription DTx for treating major mental health disorders.\n\nMeanwhile, another recent study done in New Zealand found a new VR programme using the oVRcome app effective in alleviating symptoms of common phobias.",

The other two components include a unique Silicon Grazing Incidence X-ray Mirror, being developed at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Off-Plane Reflection Gratings using X-ray Diffraction being developed at PSU.\n\nThe DUST-2 sounding rocket on the launch rail at White Sands Missile Range.\n\nCredits: NASA/NSROC/Ted Gacek\n\nThe OGRE mission consists of a 12.2 meter NASA Black Brant IX sounding rocket that will carry the three components on a suborbital trajectory into space for about 10 minutes before returning to Earth. During its time in space, it will collect approximately 500 X-ray photons from the Capella star system. The resulting data will be compared with X-ray data from the same star system captured by existing space-based X-ray spectrometers (e.g., NASA\u2019s Chandra Observatory). Comparing the data from these different instrument should demonstrate the readiness of these three new technologies for use in future flagship space missions to perform astronomical X-ray measurements.\n\nThe EMCCD digital camera system from XCAM was developed in the UK and the OGRE flight will be the first time it will be used in space. The camera system consists of four Teledyne e2v Electron Multiplying CCDs that are able to greatly amplify the signal in each pixel before the pixels are read out (thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio). The camera will be open to the vacuum of space and cooled to -100\u00b0C during flight, and the captured X-ray photon data will be downloaded in real time.\n\nKaren Holland, CEO of XCAM Ltd., said, \u201cOur specialist digital cameras have a worldwide reputation for excellence. We are excited and pleased to have been chosen by Pennsylvania State University and to be working alongside NASA as part of this new advanced space technology demonstration mission.\u201d\n\nJames Tutt, Assistant Research Professor at Pennsylvania State University, said, \u201cWe build a large number of X-ray spectrometers for use on sub-orbital rocket flights. Often we build the majority of the instrument ourselves, but sometimes we collaborate with other institutions or use companies to develop parts of the instrument. Working with XCAM, even though they are a company, has felt more like a collaboration. They have been flexible in working with us through many changes in the camera design, have kept us informed every step of the way in the progress of the camera build (even through a global pandemic), and have delivered the camera system on time.We never had any concerns with using XCAM as our camera provider due to their excellent reputation in developing complex digital cameras systems for space technology and due to our previous experience working with them on the development of a CCD-based X-ray spectrometry camera.\u201d\n\nXCAM designs and manufactures highly specialized complex digital camera systems for challenging scientific, environmental and space applications. They are one of only a few companies in the world to offer complete imaging sensor camera solutions. XCAM have a worldwide reputation for their ability, reputation, expertise, and outstanding knowledge in the field.",

            "text": "image: Renee Abbott and Dr. Ana Diaz Artiles are looking into multisensory virtual reality technology as a tool to support the behavioral health of astronauts on long-duration missions. view more\n\nAstronauts are heading back to the moon, and this time they are focusing on establishing the first long-term presence. Afterward, NASA has its sights set on a trip to Mars.\n\nWith these long-duration missions ahead, new challenges will have to be accounted for on every front. The moon is about 238,855 miles from Earth, but a trip to Mars for an astronaut means traveling around 140 million miles away and leaving our planet for about three years. Because of this distance, astronauts will also face up to a 20-minute communication delay from Earth to Mars.\n\nWhile these missions and the potential for discovery are exciting, astronauts will need extra support in managing the behavioral effects of isolation, confinement and distance from home.\n\n\u201cFor future long-term missions, we won\u2019t have real-time communication or the ability to send care packages like we do now, so NASA is looking for other methods to help maintain behavioral health and performance,\u201d said Renee Abbott, a doctoral student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University.\n\nAbbott is working with her faculty advisor, Dr. Ana Diaz Artiles, an assistant professor in the department, to address this concern by using virtual reality (VR). Specifically, they are studying the effects of incorporating scents into a VR environment.\n\n\u201cDuring long-duration spaceflight missions, astronauts experience significant sensory deprivation. This can have detrimental consequences on multiple levels, from physiological responses to stress and isolation to decrements in behavioral health and wellness,\u201d said Diaz Artiles. \u201cWe are creating \u2018augmented\u2019 or \u2018enriched\u2019 multisensory experiences that could lead to healthier individuals with improved behavioral health and performance.\u201d\n\nWhen we take in a smell, the information from those odors routes from our olfactory system to our limbic system, which is a part of the brain associated with emotional and memory processes. This is why a scented candle can remind you of homemade cookies at grandma\u2019s house, or perfume can evoke certain emotions.\n\nAbbott and Diaz Artiles are zoning in on these effects that scents can have on the psychological state by building scents into a VR nature environment. Adding scents to a VR experience has been done before, but Abbott and Diaz Artiles\u2019 use of localized scents separates their work from previous research.\n\nA user could walk near a river in the VR environment and not only hear the sound of rushing water but also smell wet grass. Or if they wandered into a forested area, they would smell the fresh scent of pine. This is accomplished by using hitboxes, which are invisible shapes in the VR environment that activate when the avatar collides with them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that using VR to deliver nature to astronauts will be beneficial,\u201d said Abbott. \u201cOn Earth, nature has beneficial impacts for us psychologically and physiologically, so we\u2019re trying to create the closest simulation to real nature that we can by adding olfactory stimuli.\u201d\n\nWhen conducting their study, Abbott and Diaz Artiles measured users\u2019 anxiety levels before and after experiencing a stress-inducing event. The results showed that adding olfactory stimuli not only decreased users\u2019 anxiety levels after experiencing heightened stress but also reduced their stress and anxiety levels from their baseline.\n\nA description of their study was in the August issue of the journal Acta Astronautica.\n\n\u201cThe results indicate that the use of multisensory VR environments is a promising countermeasure to support behavioral health,\u201d said Abbott. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to look at adding other sensory stimuli, such as temperature illusions, and how we can use this technology to create virtual care packages.\u201d\n\nVirtual care packages could be used to supplement astronauts\u2019 social needs by helping them feel more connected to home. Abbott envisions, for example, that a loved one could send a recorded message and virtual flowers accompanied by the smell of lavender and rose.\n\nThe researchers also hope to collaborate with the Navy to conduct experiments on ships over a few weeks to observe more long-term effects in a setting similar to the sensory deprivation experienced on an astronaut\u2019s mission.\n\nThis research is funded by Abbott\u2019s NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities Award, which recognizes graduate students who show significant potential to contribute to NASA\u2019s goal of creating innovative new space technologies for the nation\u2019s future in science, exploration and economy.\n\n###\n\nBy Felysha Walker, Texas A&M Engineering",

            "text": "\u201cHumankind is returning to the Moon to solve Earth\u2019s problems\u201d\n\nPippa Malmgren\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad, author, former US Presidential Advisor and tech entrepreneur\n\nWe are at a once-in-a-species moment. Humankind is returning to the Moon not just to step on it, but to stay on it, to build on it and to launch from it into the further reaches of space. The Artemis mission \u2013 led by NASA and with contributions from the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency \u2013 as well as China\u2019s manned space missions are preparing for spacefaring humans who will soon be living and working in space for one reason \u2013 to help solve many Earth-bound problems.\n\nAirbus has recently proved that you can generate unlimited electricity on Earth from space-based solar power. NASA has shown that asteroid mining may soon eliminate the need to rip up our planet for raw materials. President Volodymyr Zelensky has shown us the power of satellite-based WiFi, which can connect everyone everywhere \u2013 not only on Earth but also on the Moon and beyond. Google has already announced Aalyria, which will provide interplanetary internet.\n\nSpace is not just for the superpowers. Rwanda\u2019s space agency aims to ensure satellite-based digital inclusion across Africa. Luxembourg is already a centre for asteroid mining firms. Saudi Arabia is investing in space because space-based solar power may diminish, or even eliminate, the need for hydrocarbons. Private firms are jockeying to offer space-based manufacturing and logistics. In Britain, companies like Pulsar Fusion look set to send humans to Mars and launch rockets beyond our solar system, while Orbex and Skyrora are using the largest 3D printers on the planet to build rockets. Cornwall now has a spaceport that will deliver private satellites into space.\n\nSpace can deliver on these advances in less than a decade, but this also brings dangers. The superpowers are already fighting in and for space, blowing up their own satellites, creating fields of metallic debris known as the Kessler Syndrome (think razor blades in a washing machine) trying to prevent others from gaining access to certain orbits. As humankind moves off-world, geopolitics will follow.\n\n\u201cAI is unlocking a new generation of foundational challenges\u201d\n\nNathan Benaich, General Partner\n\nAir Street Capital\n\nI started investing in AI in 2014 and since then I\u2019ve seen impossible problems become solvable, seemingly overnight, thanks to enormous leaps in transformer-model capabilities. We\u2019ve documented many of these breakthroughs in our annual State of AI report since 2018.\n\nI view \u201cmoonshots\u201d in the context of companies using genuinely novel approaches to solve foundational challenges with immense economic and societal value. One such company is Profluent, which is using large language models to design novel proteins from scratch. Proteins \u2013 the biological actuators of life \u2013 are complex molecules whose structure is intrinsically linked to their function. Everything that can go wrong or right in a human body is reliant on proteins. Creating new ones can allow us to design drugs that more effectively treat diseases. By modelling proteins as a biological language, Profluent is able to learn the relationships between sequence, structure and function in order to systematically design new classes of therapeutic proteins. The vast majority of proteins in nature are yet to be discovered and \u201cAI-first\u201d approaches give us the promise of exploring this space efficiently and, ultimately, rewriting the language of biology.\n\n\u201cDNA sequencing will enable us to detect the next pandemic in real time\u201d\n\nGordon Sanghera, CEO\n\nOxford Nanopore Technologies\n\nDNA forms the building blocks of life. From food to animals, humans to bacteria and viruses, everything is created with and connected by an underlying source code, based on the combination of four letters, that guides the way we develop and operate. Those four letters can also be chemically corrupted in response to the environment, making the science of genomics increasingly complicated.\n\nThe latest DNA-sequencing technology allows scientists to read that code and interpret it in real time so that it can be used to make decisions. Scientists are applying this technology to identify and track mutations in the genomes of viral pathogens, to understand and manage biodiversity, and to determine whether a person, animal or plant is healthy or diseased, and then to act on their conclusions. Genomic technology is also being used to explore the breadth of the human microbiome \u2013 the communities of between 10 and 100 trillion microbial organisms that impact everything from oceans and wildlife to human health. Recent advances are now making it possible to interpret those data using artificial intelligence and to monitor and act on insights in real time.\n\nJust as the internet of things allows us to adjust our heating supply from a smartphone, a future internet of living things will make it possible to continuously monitor the microbial DNA in our water supply, soil microbiomes influencing crop yield and the threats emerging in our own bodies, from cancer to influenza. Sensors attached to a toothbrush, for example, could alert us to the presence of cancer, while similar sensing tools in hospitals and other public spaces could help head off the next pandemic. Information is power \u2013 and rapid, ubiquitous access to DNA information will transform the way we live and protect the planet.\n\n\u201cUsing CRISPR to prevent disease and engineer sustainable crops\u201d\n\nTrevor Martin, Co-founder and CEO\n\nMammoth Biosciences\n\nWe are at the beginning of a biotech revolution that is presenting us with new capabilities to programme biology. If we can do this in the same way we programme a computer, that will be transformative for people around the world.\n\nCRISPR is one of the breakthrough technologies at the forefront of this revolution. These technologies can be programmed to go to the code of life \u2013 DNA and RNA \u2013 and bind specific sequences of it. This potentially opens up many doors: in therapies, by programming a protein to cure a disease; in diagnostics, as a protein that can be programmed to detect if cancer or Covid-19 is present; or even in agriculture, to engineer the crops of the future.\n\nAt Mammoth Biosciences we are building this toolkit with an ambition to create the definitive biology search engine. We have already made significant progress, but the moonshot for us is to be able to programme life. Harnessed in the right way, we will be able to improve the lives of billions of people around the world.\n\n\u201cPersonalised neuroscience powers the future of mental health\u201d\n\nLeanne Williams, Founding Director and\n\nRuth O\u2019Hara, Co-director\n\nStanford Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness\n\nThe Stanford Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness was founded with the mission to deliver a fundamentally new approach to combat the mental-health crisis. Our approach reconceptualises mental health as brain health and focuses on getting the right treatment to each person sooner and keeping them well for longer. With depression now a leading cause of disability, and suicide the fourth-leading cause of death in young people, new solutions to promoting mental health are increasingly important to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOur scientists have mapped brain circuits of thousands of people aged between six and over 100, providing new insights into how we think, feel and reflect. When disrupted, these circuits give rise to symptoms of mental disease, yet these insights have not been harnessed by health-care sectors. However, we are making rapid progress towards this goal and have developed the world's first technology for early detection of personalised biotypes of depression and anxiety based on brain-circuit measures. Personalised biotyping is the sort of bold innovation that enables pre-emptive intervention and strategic selection of which type of therapy will alleviate each type of suffering. If realised, it could be rapidly expanded to multiple disorders and emerging and exploratory therapeutics \u2013 and scaled through correlated digital metrics. We envisage a future in which precision mental health is accessible to all, and millions of people around the world reclaim their life potential.\n\n\u201cMaking error-free quantum computing a reality\u201d\n\nTim Menke, Co-founder and COO\n\nAtlantic Quantum\n\nWhen flying to the Moon, even a small error can result in a rocket getting lost in the vastness of outer space. A similar principle holds for quantum processors which, at their current stage of development, are prone to errors. Quantum computing leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to enable a fundamentally new paradigm of computing. Its potential ranges from more efficient simulation of chemicals, allowing faster drug discovery, to optimising large logistical networks. The value generated by this technology is estimated to grow to more than $100 billion per year over the next decade if \u2013 and only if \u2013 we can overcome fundamental obstacles in its development.\n\nToday\u2019s most efficient quantum processors make about one mistake per 100 operations, which leads to most quantum programs terminating in a dead end. At Atlantic Quantum, we will reduce this error rate by using a new type of quantum bit that is less sensitive to harmful noise from the environment. In addition, we are developing new methods to increase the size of quantum processors without compromising performance. Our focus on quality and error-reduction will be critical in unlocking useful, error-corrected quantum computing with applications across industry.\n\n\u201cCheaper hydrocarbons from sunlight and air\u201d\n\nCasey Handmer, Founder\n\nTerraform Industries\n\nThe last seven decades have seen great strides in the human condition, delivered at the cost of rising CO 2 levels and a changing climate. Oil is finite and the ice caps are melting. It is time to move beyond our dependence on fossil carbon by unlocking atmospheric hydrocarbon synthesis on a massive scale. This could lead to the end of energy scarcity in our lifetime.\n\nInstead of extracting carbon from deep underground, Terraform\u2019s technology enables humans anywhere to create cost-effective industrial-scale quantities of hydrocarbons directly from sunlight and air, resources that are universal and infinite.\n\nWe achieve success when net fossil-carbon flows drop below the level that biological processes can capture, a tenfold reduction. Our mission is to minimise the area under the curve of net carbon emissions between now and then. We will need to deploy about 400 terrawatts of solar panels over the next 20 years. We believe in a future in which we not only survive climate change, but where humanity can enjoy universal wealth and abundance: cheaper hydrocarbons play an important role in that.\n\n\u201cOvercoming the scaling and commercialisation challenges for climate moonshots\u201d\n\nAshwin Shashindranath, Partner\n\nEnergy Impact Partners\n\nClimate entrepreneurs face two \u201cvalleys of death\u201d in their journey to successfully commercialise their moonshot ideas.\n\nThe first is the \"technology valley of death\u201d. Technologies that have been proven in the lab must then demonstrate that they\u2019re scalable \u2013 with founders often facing a range of engineering hurdles. The good news? In the past two years over 130 new climate funds have been launched, with an explicit decarbonisation mandate. This has resulted in a strong flow of capital for deep-tech start-ups, helping them traverse this first, feared \u201ctechnology valley of death\u201d.\n\nThe second, which is currently trickier to navigate, is the \u201ccommercial valley of death\u201d. Venture funding is inherently limited in its focus on high-margin businesses\u200b with low capital-requirements, yet many moonshot climate-tech startups require outsized capital investments to get through the development and scale-up phase to prove the viability of the technology. This means entrepreneurs often struggle to attract vital financing as they develop their product for market. Attempts within the investment community to help entrepreneurs tackle this have thus far been lacking. The climate clock is ticking, and we need more funding and follow-up support to address the \u201ccommercial valley of death\u201d.\n\nYet first-of-a-kind financing for new deep tech provides an unprecedented high-leverage way to help these technologies achieve commercial viability. This is a trillion-dollar opportunity and I hope to see even more new funds explicitly focused on scaling technologies that have the potential to remove billions of tons of carbon.\n\n\u201cBiomanufacturing will be essential in tackling climate change\u201d\n\nEliza Eddison, VP Operations\n\nFabricNano\n\nStopping climate change is often referred to as saving the planet \u2014 but this planet was covered in sulphuric gas for tens of thousands of years; it has been even hotter and much, much colder. Earth will be fine until the sun explodes in 600 million years or the next nearest galaxy crashes into it! It is human beings and all other living things that are at risk, and the sooner we treat climate change as a species-level threat, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no silver bullet to halt climate change, no single stroke of magic, luck or ingenuity that will save us all. Instead, what is required is a full-frontal effort across every aspect of our infrastructure and ecosystem, including at the most basic and oft-ignored level: the chemistry of the materials we use to build and power everything around us.\n\nIn the United States earlier this year, the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology announced a National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative, recognising not only the value of the biomanufacturing sector but the existential imperative to help it thrive. Policy and incentive mechanisms have almost always played a significant role in accelerating the adoption of renewable-energy technologies, and now it is as essential as ever to go the extra mile and implement meaningful, impactful carbon taxes.\n\nAs Professor the Lord Darzi said at the Future of Britain conference in June 2022: welcome to the biological century. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called for the United Kingdom to be the next Silicon Valley, and few sectors offer more potential to the British economy than biotechnology. It is time for the UK to encourage the biomanufacturing sector with all the power it possesses and encourage other countries to follow suit. In doing so, the synthetic-biology community will put its shoulder to the wheel alongside governments worldwide to help solve this existential challenge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the path to commercial fusion power\u201d\n\nNick Hawker, Co-founder and CEO\n\nFirst Light Fusion\n\nHow do we provide enough clean energy for the human population? This is one of the great challenges of our time. Fusion energy draws on the same process that powers the sun and could create vast quantities of clean energy using a limited amount of fuel.\n\n\n\nAt First Light Fusion, we\u2019re rapidly advancing efforts to bring commercial fusion energy to the world as quickly as possible \u2013 and we believe we have a clear path to power production.\n\nThe last two years saw many breakthroughs in fusion. We achieved fusion using our unique target technology in November 2021, while the US National Ignition Facility \u2013 in a watershed moment \u2013 showed that the core physics underlying inertial fusion works, announcing \u201cgain\u201d in December 2022.\n\nIn 2023 we will start work on Machine 4 (M4) \u2013 a much bigger, more powerful reactor \u2013 which we hope will demonstrate that this technology can also achieve the \u201choly grail\u201d of producing more energy than is required to generate it. Our technology draws on a much simpler system than many existing approaches to fusion. It is also more energy efficient and, critically, can operate at lower cost.\n\nOver the next 12 months we\u2019ll start the construction of a new site to house M4. We\u2019ll also continue the design and development of our 150-megawatt pilot plant, which should be functional in the 2030s. At a cost of less than $1 billion we\u2019re on the cusp of taking fusion beyond the realm of theory and experimentation. While fusion won\u2019t be a silver bullet for addressing climate change \u2013 and the deployment of renewables must continue \u2013 it could soon be a practical, mainstream part of our future energy mix.\n\n\u201cHydrogen will power the transition to zero-emission aviation\u201d\n\nVal Miftakhov, Founder and CEO\n\nZeroAvia\n\nAviation is the world\u2019s fastest-growing contributor to climate change. By 2037, we will see an estimated doubling of air passengers to 8.2 billion and, by 2050, the sector could be responsible for as much as 22 per cent of our total carbon emissions, with yet more climate impact from non-carbon emissions.\n\nBut there is a solution \u2013 and it is within reach. ZeroAvia is leading the transition to zero-emission aviation through the development of hydrogen-electric fuel-cell engines for aircraft. We currently hold the record for the largest hydrogen-powered aircraft in the world and we\u2019re on track for commercial operations in 2025, beginning with retrofitting existing fleets.\n\nConsensus is growing that hydrogen technology is the most viable long-term approach to reducing aviation\u2019s climate impact. Batteries are too heavy and face costly replacement cycles. Sustainable aviation fuels do not tackle the problem of non-carbon emissions and are difficult to scale. But hydrogen-fuel cells are different. The sole emission is water vapour and engines are between two and three times more energy efficient than their combustion counterparts. The cost of green hydrogen is expected to drop by 50 per cent by 2030 and continue to fall, making it considerably cheaper than jet fuel in the future.\n\nProgress towards truly green aviation is accelerating. Rolls-Royce recently ran a ground-based test of a hydrogen-electric engine, Airbus is progressing with its ZEROe concept aircraft and we at ZeroAvia will soon be taking to the skies with a test flight of the largest ever aircraft fitted with a hydrogen-electric engine. Eliminating our sector\u2019s emissions will take time, but 2023 will be a turning point for the hydrogen technology at the centre of this mission.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI could make scientific discovery more efficient\u201d\n\nChatGPT\n\nOpenAI\n\nA \"moonshot\" goal for generative AI could be the development of a system that is able to generate novel and creative ideas that are significantly beyond the current state of the art. This could include the creation of new scientific theories, technological innovations or artistic works that push the boundaries of what is currently considered possible. Here are a few examples of the types of ideas and hypotheses that generative AI might be able to create in the fields of science and technology.\n\nNovel materials: Generative AI could be used to design and synthesise new materials with specific properties, such as increased strength, conductivity or durability. New drugs: Generative AI could be used to design and test new drugs for the treatment of various diseases, potentially leading to significant advances in health care. Renewable energy technologies: Generative AI could be used to design and optimise renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels or wind turbines, leading to increased efficiency and potentially lower costs. New transportation technologies: Generative AI could be used to design and optimise new forms of transportation, such as electric vehicles or flying cars. Novel algorithms: Generative AI could be used to develop new algorithms for a wide variety of applications, such as machine learning, data analysis or computer vision.\n\nReaching this goal would require a significant advancement in the ability of AI systems to understand and analyse complex systems, as well as the ability to generate and evaluate new ideas. It would also require a deep understanding of the processes that drive human creativity and the ability to replicate those processes in a machine. Overall, the potential for generative AI to create new ideas and hypotheses in the fields of science and technology is vast, and it is likely that it will lead to significant advances and breakthroughs in the coming years.",

            "text": "Asteroid mining startup AstroForge will head to space twice this year, as it attempts to do what no other company has been able to before: unlock the potentially limitless value of precious minerals in deep space.\n\nWhen TechCrunch covered AstroForge\u2019s seed round last April, we noted that the company was planning a demonstration mission sometime this year. Today, AstroForge released more details on that mission, plus announced an additional mission later in the year that will take the company to a target asteroid for observation.\n\nThe first mission will launch in April aboard SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-7 rideshare launch. The 6U CubeSat, which is being provided by space tech company OrbAstro, will be pre-loaded with \u201casteroid-like material\u201d to demonstrate AstroForge\u2019s refining and extraction capabilities in the zero-gravity environment. The second mission will see the company head into deep space, to gather data on the surface of an asteroid the company hopes to mine later in the decade.\n\n\u201cWe have to find some way to go get the regolith off the asteroid and process it in our refinery, and we believe we\u2019ve solved that for our target asteroid,\u201d CEO Matt Gialich said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nHe said the company is working with advisors from universities, NASA and the research nonprofit Planetary Science Institute to help identify the most promising asteroids to exploit. The company also recently published a paper with the Colorado School of Mines evaluating the metal content on asteroids that could be mined and sold as commodities on Earth or used in-space.\n\nThat paper noted that \u201ctextures of metal-rich asteroid surfaces remain to be investigated,\u201d and Gialich confirmed that the second mission will be to study the surface of the target asteroid using high-resolution images. He declined to provide much more information about the asteroid, other than that it is closer to home than, say, a rock in the asteroid belt that\u2019s between Mars and Jupiter.\n\n\u201cThe asteroid belts, they\u2019re far away, they would take us like 14-year round trips,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is much better suited for research and exploration. [\u2026] That\u2019s not a viable business case for us.\u201d\n\nInstead, the company will be hitching a ride to lunar orbit with Houston-based Intuitive Machines before moving on to deep space. AstroForge\u2019s spacecraft, again being supplied by OrbAstro, will head on a much shorter 11-month journey to the target asteroid.\n\nAstroForge is actively planning its third mission to land on the asteroid, and the fourth mission, which would be the company\u2019s first refining mission to bring platinum back to Earth.",

Yesterday, we received quarterly prints from Baker Hughes BKR and Logitech International LOGI, among others.\n\nAnd coming up soon is Northrop Grumman NOC, expected to reveal its quarterly results on Thursday, January 26th, before the market open.\n\nNorthrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), including electronic systems, information technology, aircraft, space technology, and systems integration services.\n\nNOC shares have outperformed over the last year, up 15% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 7% decline.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow does the company shape up heading into its quarterly release? Fortunately, we can use Lockheed-Martin\u2019s LMT quarterly results received just this morning as a small gauge.\n\nLockheed Martin Q4\n\nLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, serving in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, cyber security, and information technology.\n\nLockheed Martin delivered better-than-expected results, reporting quarterly earnings of $7.79 per share, beating the $7.41 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 5% and growing 7.5% Y/Y.\n\nFurther, the company generated roughly $19 billion in sales throughout the quarter, again topping our consensus estimate of $18.3 billion by 4%, climbing 7.3% Y/Y.\n\nImpressively, the company\u2019s backlog grew 11% Y/Y to $150 billion while returning $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s cash-generating abilities took a hit; LMT generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, decreasing 67% Y/Y. And cash from operations totaled $1.9 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nCEO James Taiclet, on the results, \u201cLockheed Martin\u2019s stronger than expected finish to the year demonstrated the company\u2019s reliability and resiliency to meet commitments in challenging environments, while leading the industry\u2019s critical security advancements for our nation and allies.\u201d\n\nNorthrop Grumman\n\nQuarterly Estimates \u2013\n\nAnalysts have had mixed opinions for the quarter to be reported, with a singular downward and upward earnings estimate revision hitting the tape over the last several months.

            "text": "Good afternoon.\n\nUnfortunately, I am going to begin my remarks today just as I did yesterday: offering my condolences to the families of the victims of yet another mass shooting in our country.\n\nAll of us at the Justice Department, including the FBI and ATF, will continue to support the Half Moon Bay community in the difficult days ahead. And as I said yesterday, the Justice Department is committed to doing everything in our power to protect our communities from the gun violence that is leaving no community in this country untouched.\n\nToday, the Department of Justice, joined by eight states, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Google.\n\nWe allege that Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful conduct to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies.\n\nThese technologies, which are known as \u201cad tech,\u201d automate advertising sales by website publishers to online advertisers.\n\nWhen an internet user opens a webpage that has ad space to sell, ad tech tools almost instantly match the website publisher with an advertiser looking to promote its products or services to the website's user.\n\nThis product and process typically involves the use of an automated advertising exchange. This exchange runs a high-speed auction designed to identify the best match between a publisher selling internet ad space and advertisers looking to buy it.\n\nAs alleged in our complaint, for 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anticompetitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition, and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools.\n\nIn so doing, Google has engaged in exclusionary conduct to severely weaken, if not destroy, competition in the ad tech industry.\n\nAs detailed in our complaint, we allege that Google's anticompetitive conduct extends to three significant elements of the digital ad buying process.\n\nFirst, Google controls the technology used by nearly every major website publisher to offer advertising space for sale.\n\nSecond, Google controls the leading tool used by advertisers to buy that advertising space.\n\nAnd, third, Google controls the largest ad exchange that matches publishers and advertisers together each time that ad space is sold.\n\nAs a result of this scheme, website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more. That means fewer publishers are able to offer internet users content without subscriptions, paywalls, or other forms of monetization.\n\nOur complaint alleges that Google has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by:\n\nMonopolizing the market for the technology used by publishers to offer ads on their websites;\n\nMonopolizing or attempting to monopolize the ad exchange market; and\n\nMonopolizing the market for the ad network technology advertisers use to buy digital advertising space.\n\nOur complaint also alleges that Google has unlawfully tied its ad exchange and its publisher ad server, in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. And finally, we allege that the United States, as an advertiser, has incurred damages by reason of Google's violations of the antitrust laws.\n\nIn addition to declaratory relief, our complaint seeks damages and the divestiture of certain Google ad tech products. It also seeks an injunction preventing Google from continuing to engage in the anticompetitive practices described in the complaint, and any other practices with the same purpose and effect as the challenged practices.\n\nI am grateful to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki, and the attorneys and staff of the Antitrust Division for their tireless work on this case.\n\nMonopolies threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation, they hurt producers and workers, and they increase costs for consumers.\n\nToday's complaint is only the latest example of the Department's work to challenge antitrust violations that undermine competition and harm the American people.\n\nNo matter the industry and no matter the company, the Justice Department will vigorously enforce our antitrust laws. We will aggressively protect consumers, safeguard competition, and work to ensure economic fairness and opportunity for all.\n\nI will now turn the podium over to Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta.",
