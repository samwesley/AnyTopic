            "text": "When PitchBlack, the \u201cShark Tank\u201d style competition where Black entrepreneurs pitch their businesses and compete for cash prizes, returns next week, it will be at its biggest venue yet.\n\nAbout 70 people attended the 2015 inaugural pitch competition, held at the Village Ballroom in Northeast Portland. Seven entrepreneurs competed for a prize pool of $900 that was divided among the top three competitors.\n\nThis year, eleven Black-led companies will deliver a five-minute pitch of their ideas to a sold-out crowd of more than 500 at the Patricia Reser Center for the Arts in Beaverton. The top three contestants will split a prize pool of up to $60,000, and organizer Stephen Green says that figure will continue to rise as the Feb. 7 competition approaches.\n\nThe contest has grown in popularity each year, drawing more participants, sponsors and attendees, with tickets selling out every time, said Green, who is also board chair of PitchBlack\u2019s main sponsor, Built Oregon.\n\n\u201cIt has been pretty amazing. The most important thing is that people in the Pacific Northwest startup ecosystem have gotten more aware of the amazing Black entrepreneurs and companies being built here,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe event serves as a platform to connect Black entrepreneurs with the region\u2019s startup ecosystem while also awarding cash prizes that they can put toward their businesses. Today, it is the biggest event of its kind on the West Coast.\n\nIts success has also led Green to bring versions of PitchBlack to other cities, including Seattle, Austin and Philadelphia. Green\u2019s work also inspired a similar annual event called Pitch Latinx.\n\nSince its inception seven years ago, PitchBlack has been held every year -- except in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- in Portland. But this year, the event heads to Beaverton.\n\nThe money comes from fundraising, sponsors and tickets sold for $29 apiece, but Green said he hopes to attract more sponsors until the event date to increase the prize pot. Some of this year\u2019s major sponsors so far include Nike, Oregon Community Foundation, the city of Beaverton, Autodesk and the Port of Portland, he said.\n\nGreen said the goal of PitchBlack is to introduce people to new businesses or ideas they might not know about so they could back them financially. He said the event also serves as a way to increase the visibility, equality and awareness of Black entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cThis year we have pitches from a wide range of businesses. We\u2019ve got a nonprofit pitching ideas, some people who are selling new product ideas, and some people have new ideas to provide a service,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe point is to expose people to a really broad range of black businesses that are currently doing things here in the area.\u201d\n\nTo date, 100 Black-led company founders have pitched their ideas through PitchBlack, and 1,000 people have attended across all the cities. The event has generated $100,000 that has been invested into winning ideas.\n\n\u201cIn Portland alone, the companies that have pitched since the event started have gone on to raise over $45 million for their ideas,\u201d Green said. \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty pretty cool to see the people move forward with their ideas.\u201d\n\nThe number of Black-owned businesses grew from 2017 to 2019 by 8% in all sectors of the U.S. economy, according to Census data released last year. One of the event\u2019s first winners from 2015, Tyrone Poole of OneApp, an online property registry designed to streamline the rental application process, went on to win national and global pitch contests since PitchBlack.\n\nPoole said although the prize money in PitchBlack\u2019s very first event was only about $300, participating and winning the event helped raise the profile of the company now known as OneApp.\n\n\u201cPitchBlack got my name and my story out there,\u201d Poole said. \u201cIt added value and credibility to my idea when it was in its early steps, and I went on to compete in other pitch competitions and win at them. That\u2019s how I was able to raise money for my company when I couldn\u2019t get any Oregon funding firms to invest.\u201d\n\nPoole said the Black community needs more platforms like PitchBlack that connect equity-focused investors with minority-owned businesses that they would otherwise not know about.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s events like PitchBlack that help normalize Black entrepreneurship and ownership of all types of businesses,\u201d Poole said.\n\nLast year\u2019s top winner was Adre, a sustainability and BIPOC-focused real estate development company founded and led by Anyeley Hallov\u00e1. Adre won $40,000 from the competition plus another $10,000 from a donation from lntel\u2019s RISE Technology Initiative.\n\n\u201cAt the time, my company was just a year old, so I was just getting started and doing everything myself,\u201d Hallov\u00e1 said. \u201cThe money from PitchBlack was greatly helpful since it allowed me to hire an employee and pursue more projects.\u201d\n\nGreen said that this year\u2019s change in venue reflects a larger focus on Black-led businesses on the Portland metro area\u2019s west side.\n\nThe organizations pitching at this year\u2019s event include:\n\n--Kristine de Leon, kdeleon@oregonian.com",

In the subsequent accelerator phase, stretching four months from end-May to end-September, project funding of up to $100,000 will be provided for each of the winning startups, together with mentorship from Zurich leaders and external experts.\n\n\u201cThis will allow the startups, working closely with Zurich\u2019s leaders and businesses, to validate how their joint solution can meet evolving customer needs and prepare an operational business plan to adopt it across the group. By end-December 2023, the proven initiatives will have kicked off, bringing to life the joint proposition.\u201d\n\nZurich, which currently works with 30 startups from previous years, will be accepting 2023 submissions until February 27. There had been over 4,500 submissions, involving more than 30 countries, across the past three editions.\n\n\u201cPrevious championships have shown that the most value comes from startups with ideas to disrupt single parts of the value chain, or enablers, rather than challengers looking to disrupt the whole industry,\u201d commented group chief strategy officer Paolo Mantero.\n\n\u201cOur goal is collaborating together and bringing together the best of what we and the startups have to offer.

The agency lost its last case depending on such an argument, FTC v. Steris Corporation.\n\n\u201cThe problem with potential competition cases is that there are so few that each loss is a significant loss,\u201d Calkins said.\n\nDavila\u2019s opinion, though sealed as of Wednesday, will likely be scrutinized by other companies whose startup acquisitions are being reviewed by antitrust regulators.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a setback, but not a fatal one,\u201d Calkins said. \u201cEach time the government loses, there\u2019s a hit to its aura of invincibility. More defendants gain confidence and more judges are going to listen keenly to the arguments made by the defendants.\u201d\n\nThe FTC\u2019s suit in the California court last year had been considered a long shot by legal scholars. Dusting off a rarely used \u201cpotential competition\u201d theory, the agency primarily alleged that the merger wouldn\u2019t hamper current competition but would allow Meta to roll up a future competitor.\n\nBig Tech companies often engage in a series of small acquisitions to gain control of a developing sector before they face serious competition, as Facebook did when it acquired Instagram.\n\nA win for the FTC could have served as a template for future challenges to more consequential mergers, court watchers previously told Bloomberg Law.\n\nThe FTC will likely not go away quietly in the Meta-Within case. There\u2019s a separate case proceeding in its in-house court. The agency has a week to decide whether it\u2019s appealing Davila\u2019s decision, before Meta can close the deal.\n\n\n\nThe commission has proven adept at learning from its mistakes and stubbornly hanging on to long-term goals even through individual defeats, said Bruce Hoffman, a Cleary Gottlieb partner and former FTC official.\n\n\u201cThe FTC has a long history of not being deterred by major litigation losses,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at major issues like the state action doctrine where the FTC has prevailed, it had a lot of losses and eventually won.\u201d\n\nThe FTC declined to comment.\n\nBut the lawsuit itself is a message from the FTC, said Eleanor Tyler, a Bloomberg Law legal analyst. It signifies that the agency will no longer accept the \u201crisks of under-enforcement\u201d to avoid the appearance of over-enforcement, she said.\n\nThe FTC suffered a string of losses against hospital mergers in the 1990s, but managed to reverse its losing record after studying the market, Tyler noted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that this loss changes that message, or really even dents it,\u201d she said.",

Illustration by Steven Coleman/The Daily Campus.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation hosted its first \u201cGet Seeded\u201d event of the year, where various contestants compete for $1,000 in seeding money after presenting a short elevator pitch. The event allows budding entrepreneurs of any age to appear in front of a large audience and share some of their best ideas.\n\nThose familiar with \u201cShark Tank\u201d are most likely aware of how important the elevator pitch is. Each contestant presented a slide deck of their product, with the goal of convincing the panel of judges to consider them for the $1,000 plan. Audience members were also encouraged to ask questions to find out more about each startup and how their plans could translate into the real world.\n\nWhile devoid of personalities as eccentric as Kevin O\u2019Leary, \u201cGet Seeded\u201d is filled with brilliant ideas that seek to better our communities. Every presentation had a wide variety of applications, making each one stand out from the others. Some were medically focused, while others centered on education.\n\nToribio\u2019s pitch involved creating an EKG and heart rate monitor that\u2019s able to transmit more information than most fitness trackers, while being less invasive than traditional medical devices. Through special conductive polymers, this form of smart clothing proposes a revolutionary approach to medical monitoring devices.\n\nAnother company, Milieu, pitched a social app for connecting people with neurodiversity, allowing them to interact with others who have the same unique experiences as them. This product seeks to connect people who aren\u2019t catered to by traditional social apps with a more caring and kind experience.\n\n\u201cThere will be features that will be able to connect students via events organized in a central news feed,\u201d said founder Sabrina Uva.\n\nUniBond is another startup that approaches research assignments in college from a global perspective, allowing students from around the world to connect with one another to collaborate on research projects. This score-based system intends to link students with similar interests and skill levels, and encourages them to go beyond borders to work with people of different backgrounds.\n\nAnother student-focused program, PazaTech, explained its goal to educate students in rural parts of Kenya who struggle to gain access to the i I nternet. As described in their mission statement by founder Nicole Muthoni, \u201cPazaTech helps close the digital divide that is a new form of colonialism.\u201d",
