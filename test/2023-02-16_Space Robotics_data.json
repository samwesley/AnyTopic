            "text": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 Airbus is urging stepped-up European cooperation to ensure the continent\u2019s security and future access to space after a year that saw the company suffer fallout from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the crash of a European satellite launcher.\n\nThe France-based plane maker on Thursday reported a record overall 2022 profit of 4.25 billion euros ($4.55 billion), up from 4.21 billion euros the year before, despite inflation challenges and supply chain disruptions that slowed efforts to ramp up aircraft production.\n\nCEO Guillaume Faury said the company aims to deliver 720 planes this year, up from 661 last year, in an effort to keep up with growing demand by airlines as travel picks up worldwide following COVID-19 disruptions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Air India unveiled an massive order that included 250 Airbus passenger jets. Airbus didn't disclose financial terms of the deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nAirbus took in 820 orders in 2022 and reported revenue of 58.8 billion euros ($63 billion). U.S. rival Boeing has lagged behind Airbus in deliveries but has been closing the gap, reporting 774 orders and 480 deliveries last year.\n\nBoth companies are struggling with shortages of engines and other supply chain issues that limit how fast they can build and deliver planes.\n\nThose supply issues have overshadowed what is otherwise a rebounding market for aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\nDemand has been supported by the travel recovery from the worst of the pandemic, a spike in fuel prices that put a premium on newer, more efficient aircraft, and the need for smaller, single-aisle aircraft flying point to point such as the Airbus A-321.\n\n\u201cIt's nothing to do with markets and everything to do with supply,\" Aboulafia said. \"The market's fine \u2014 it's just a question of what supply can bear.\u201d\n\nThe Airbus Defence and Space business struggled last year, notably taking a 477 million euro ($511 million) loss on the long-troubled A400M military transport plane, in part linked to unusually high inflation.\n\nFaury said the European space sector also was hit by the loss of access to Russia's Soyuz rocket launchers and the failure of a new Vega-C rocket soon after takeoff from French Guiana in December. The Vega-C is made by Arianespace, part owned by Airbus.\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s independent access to space is now fundamentally challenged,\" Faury told reporters in Toulouse.\n\nThe last year \u201chas proven the need for a stronger Europe in defense and space ... to maintain the peace, stability and security which our societies have become used to,\" Faury said.\n\nWhile pledging that Airbus is on track to meet promises to reduce the industry's heavy carbon emissions, he added: \u201cThere is no sustainability without security.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Airbus planes operated by Russian airlines no longer have access to parts or maintenance provided by the company because of Western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe start to hear about situations where they are missing parts or components or an inability to keep some of the planes in flight,\" Faury said. \u201cBut we are not speaking with the Russian airlines. We miss visibility. And yes, we are we are slightly concerned about the way the planes are operated, but we have no real means to act.\"\n\nAirbus is still buying titanium from Russia but looking for other suppliers, Faury said, adding that \u201cit will still take some time to be fully independent from the Russian sources.\u201d\n\nShares in Airbus, which employs 134,000 people worldwide, were trading up 3% on Thursday morning after the annual results.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer David McHugh contributed from Frankfurt, Germany.",

            "text": "If the boxy Opportunity rover could elicit years of anthropomorphized love and goodwill, then surely Earthlings will warm to the idea of sending a snake-shaped robot to the moon. This robot\u2014the brainchild of students at Northeastern University\u2014is meant to wiggle across difficult terrain, measure water in the pit of craters, and bite its own tail to become a spinning ouroboros tumbling down the side of a lunar cliff.\n\nNASA\u2019s annual Big Idea Challenge presents a new query each year that\u2019s geared toward an engineering problem the agency needs to solve. In fall 2021, students from universities across the United States set out to design a robot that could survive extreme lunar terrain and send data back to Earth. The winning team, of students from Northeastern\u2019s Students for the Exploration and Development of Space club, took home the top prize in November and now hope to turn their winning design into an advanced prototype that could actually be sent to the moon.\n\nUsing $180,000 of NASA funds, the students focused on designing a robot that could navigate Shackleton Crater\u2014a 13-mile-wide basin near the lunar south pole where NASA confirmed the presence of water ice in 2018. Water is plentiful on Earth but a high-value commodity outside our atmosphere. Humans require water to survive, but it\u2019s extremely heavy, and lugging it 240,000 miles from home is cost-prohibitive. So local water in ice form would be an enormous boon for NASA\u2019s Artemis mission as it seeks to establish a lunar base.\n\nBefore the agency can rely on this ice for crewed missions, however, it needs to confirm just how much is located in different regions of the lunar surface and what its chemical composition is. But there are a few challenges to getting data from a 2-mile-deep crater. One: The floor is in permanent shadow, which means temperatures hover hundreds of degrees below freezing. Two: The angle of incline from the rim to the floor is 30.5 degrees, steeper than Mount Everest. Three: The moon is sandy. Any robot attempting to traverse this terrain is going to have to survive bone-chilling temperatures, a precipitous descent, and a gritty environment.\n\nThe students considered hopping, legged, and rolling robots, like the wheeled rovers already on Mars. But rolling robots would sink in the regolith and couldn\u2019t safely navigate terrain as steep as the Shackleton rim. Legged robots also sink and are less stable in sandy environments. Hopping robots would have a difficult time launching and landing without sustaining damage or getting stuck. \u201cWe looked at this whole suite of different robot designs and thought, is there any way we could combine different locomotions?\u201d recalls Yash Bhora, a physics major who helped build software for the team.\n\nBhora and his teammates considered a tumbling robot, one that could harness the partial gravity of the moon to propel itself down the crater more efficiently. But once it arrived at the floor, it would need a different type of functionality. \u201cA tumbling robot by itself cannot really manipulate a big science instrument or maneuver as precisely as a walking robot,\u201d says Matthew Schroeter, the team\u2019s lead, who graduated from Northeastern in 2022 and now works at Honeybee Robotics.",

            "text": "If the boxy Opportunity Rover could evoke years of anthropomorphized love and goodwill, then surely earthlings will warm to the idea of \u200b\u200bsending a snake-shaped robot to the moon. This robot \u2014 the brainchild of Northeastern University students \u2014 is said to wobble over difficult terrain, measure water in crater pits, and bite its own tail to become a spinning ouroboros that plummets down the side of a lunar cliff.\n\nEach year, NASA\u2019s annual Big Idea Challenge presents a new query aligned to a technical problem the agency needs to solve. In the fall of 2021, students at universities across the United States set out to design a robot that could survive extreme lunar terrain and send data back to Earth. The winning team, made up of students from Northeastern\u2019s Students for the Exploration and Development of Space Club, took home the grand prize in November and now hope to turn their winning design into an advanced prototype that could actually be sent to the moon.\n\nWith $180,000 in NASA funding, the students focused on developing a robot that could navigate Shackleton Crater \u2014 a 13-mile-wide basin near the lunar south pole where NASA confirmed the presence of water ice in 2018. Water is abundant on Earth, but highly valuable outside of our atmosphere. Humans need water to survive, but it is extremely heavy and lugging it 240,000 miles from home is prohibitive. So local ice-form water would be a tremendous boon for NASA\u2019s Artemis mission, which is attempting to establish a lunar base.\n\nBut before the agency can rely on this ice for manned missions, it needs to confirm how much is in different regions of the lunar surface and what its chemical composition is. However, there are some challenges to getting data from a 2 mile deep crater. First, the ground is in perpetual shade, meaning temperatures hover hundreds of degrees below freezing. Second, the angle of inclination from the edge to the ground is 30.5 degrees, steeper than Mount Everest. Third: the moon is sandy. Any robot attempting to traverse this terrain must survive freezing temperatures, a steep descent, and a gritty environment.\n\nStudents thought about hopping, legged walking and rolling robots, like the wheeled rovers that are already on Mars. But rolling robots would sink into regolith and could not safely navigate terrain as steep as the Shackleton rim. Legged robots also sink and are less stable in sandy environments. Bouncing robots would have a hard time taking off and landing without taking damage or getting stuck. \u201cWe looked at this whole range of different robot designs and thought, is there a way to combine different modes of locomotion?\u201d recalls Yash Bhora, a physics student who helped create software for the team.\n\nBhora and his teammates considered a tumbling robot, one that could use the moon\u2019s partial gravity to more efficiently propel itself down the crater. But once it hit the ground, it would need a different kind of functionality. \u201cA tumbling robot alone can\u2019t really manipulate a large scientific instrument or maneuver it as precisely as a walking robot,\u201d says Matthew Schroeter, the team leader, who graduated from Northeastern in 2022 and now works at Honeybee Robotics.",
