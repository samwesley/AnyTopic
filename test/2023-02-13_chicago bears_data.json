            "text": "The Chicago Bears\u2019 plans to build a new stadium in the coming years were hit with some bad news after the Governor of Illinois revealed the state will not be footing any of the bills for the billion-dollar endeavor.\n\nNext year, the Chicago Bears\u2019 legendary stadium Soldier Field will turn 100 years old. While it is one of the oldest active sports venues in the country, it does not have the same historic value and charm as classics like Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. That is why there have long been talks of the Bears looking to finally construct a new arena for Illinois\u2019 most popular football team.\n\nIn 2021, the franchise set the wheels in motion for an eventual build when they paid $197 million to purchase the property the Arlington Heights Racetrack once sat on. Since then, the Bears have revealed hopes to construct a massive $5 billion entertainment district centered around what would be a $2.2 billion domed stadium.\n\nRelated: Chicago Bears legend \u2018disgusted\u2019 by franchise, calls out organization\n\nSuch a development would probably require some help from the state, but the top official in Illinois is not interested in giving a \u201cprivate business\u201d like the Chicago Bears assistance to pay for the project.\n\nGovernor JB Pritzker passes on helping Chicago Bears with new stadium development\n\nCredit: USA Today Network\n\nDuring an appearance in Peoria, Illinois this week, Governor JB Pritzker was asked if the state would help pay for the team\u2019s development plans in Arlington Heights. This is a common practice as organizations and local governments work together on new stadiums because of the mutual benefits of such a project.\n\nHowever, Pritzker shut down that possibility when he said, \u201cI am of the opinion that it\u2019s not our obligation as the state to step in and provide major funding, and I certainly don\u2019t want to burden taxpayers with major support for a private business (via The Center Square).\u201d\n\nThe news is a big hit to the Chicago Bears stadium plans after State Sen. Ann Gillespie filed a bill recently that would allow up to 40 years worth of tax breaks to major organizations like the Bears in Arlington Heights.",

            "text": "The Justin Fields trade rumors aren\u2019t going away. They won\u2019t until the 2023 draft arrives and the Chicago Bears have decided what to do with the #1 overall pick. Plenty of experts believe the possibility exists GM Ryan Poles will pull the ripcord, trade Fields, and draft his own quarterback. Others think such an idea is dumb. Fields made more than enough progress in 2022 to justify more time. Improve the offensive line, add more weapons, and give him a reasonable chance to keep growing in the same offensive system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is the most likely course of action the Bears will take. However, it doesn\u2019t mean they will completely ignore the quarterback position. Conor Orr of Sports Illustrated believes the team will seek options at some point in the draft with a clear objective in mind.\n\n\u201cThey will draft a quarterback \u2026 but not in the first round. This Bears draft will be about building stylistic compliments for Justin Fields, if the franchise is indeed committed to building around him. Like the Ravens had done for years with Lamar Jackson, the Bears need a quarterback who can step in and operate a system that is designed to accentuate the same kind of personnel they are acquiring for Fields.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem with Fields is his playing style. While effective, it can also be tough on the body. That means injuries. Chicago lost both games without him in the lineup this past season, both in blowout fashion. Trevor Siemian and Nathan Peterman couldn\u2019t run the offense as it was meant to be. The idea is to find a QB in the draft with similar physical traits to Fields. Similar to Tyler Huntley in Baltimore or Tyrod Taylor in New York.\n\nThis would be a sensible move by the Chicago Bears.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with adding insurance at the most important position in the sport. Chicago already reaped the rewards of such a move in the past. They might\u2019ve never made the playoffs in 2005 if they hadn\u2019t drafted Kyle Orton in the 4th round. His ability to step up in the wake of Rex Grossman\u2019s injury proved crucial. There is no shortage of quarterbacks in this upcoming draft with the necessary athletic traits to run this offense similar to Fields.\n\nFresno State standout Jake Haener was the MVP of the Senior. While undersized and boasting an average arm, he\u2019s mobile, smart, tough, and has excellent improvisational skills. Hendon Hooker was on his way to 1st round status in Tennessee before injuring his ACL. The Chicago Bears would have to wait out his recovery process, but he has the athleticism, accuracy, and poise of a guy who can play at the NFL level. Once the draft turns to day three, fans should start watching carefully. Orr might be correct. Poles may look to find quarterback help.",

The Drip God is the Monday Night delight for fans on WWE\u2019s flagship show, RAW. Moreover, before his singles run, he also made a name for himself as a part of the famous faction. With his experience working in teams, Seth Rollins wishes to team up with Chicago Bears Player Eddie Jackson in the future.\n\nAs mentioned before, Seth Rollins was a part of the highly popular faction in WWE, The Shield. The former Architect used to lay a path of carnage with his fellow Hounds of Justice, Roman Reigns, and Jon Moxley.\n\nFurthermore, Seth Rollins has also gone on to team up with other WWE superstars such as Braun Strowman and Jason Jordan. In all sense, Seth has a thing for dream teams and it looks like he is looking to form a crossover team with an athlete from another sport.\n\nCrossovers are a favorite in professional wrestling, as many fans are aware. The world of wrestling always likes to try to attract crossover fans from other forms of entertainment, whether it\u2019s a contemporary crossover with characters like Bad Bunny or the Impractical Jokers or a crossover from the past including figures like David Arquette or Dennis Rodman.\n\nSeth Rollins was recently asked to name a current Chicago Bears player he\u2019d want to pair up with. Rollins took no time in taking Eddie Jackson\u2019s name during the latest episode of the CHGO Sports podcast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stick with the now and I\u2019ll say Eddie Jackson. He\u2019s like a hawk-man. He\u2019s a visionary, an architect. He sees things before they happen, you know what I\u2019m saying? He\u2019s got those, as a safety you\u2019ve gotta have those eyes, you\u2019ve gotta be able to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nSeth Rollins has been involved in the WWE United States championship picture for quite a few months. Rollins will be a part of WWE\u2019s next pay-per-view in less than a week, Elimination Chamber, competing in the namesake match involving five other competitors for the star-spangled prize.\n\nWhat is your take on this story?

            "text": "Analysis: \"Now onto Mr. Young, and his addition to a Colts team that has tried and failed to address the quarterback position ever since Andrew Luck's shocking retirement. I don't think there's any question that if Young was two inches taller and 20 pounds heavier, he'd be the first overall pick, or at least, the undisputed No. 1 player in the class at the position. Perhaps there still wouldn't be an argument if C.J. Stroud hadn't turned into a different player against Georgia. As I posited in a recent study of Georgia's Stetson Bennett, NFL teams simply don't draft players with Young's (or Bennett's) size profile and expect them to be immediate starters. Even Deshaun Watson (my comp for Young on an on-the-field basis, obviously) came out of Clemson at 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds. So, it's on to Young's skill set. And in terms of everything else you want in a quarterback \u2014 arm talent, processing speed, field vision, and the ability to hold an offense together \u2014 he's as good as it gets. Bryce Young has what it takes to succeed in the NFL, and quickly. We'll just have to see how many teams clench their sphincters when it's time to turn in the card.\"",

But I\u2019m open to suggestions.\n\n25: HBCU Legacy Bowl in New Orleans.\n\n28: The NFL Scouting Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis begins. It runs through March 6.\n\nMarch\n\n7: Deadline for teams to designate Franchise or Transition Tag players.\n\nAlso, colleges can begin hosting Pro Days for draft-eligible prospects on campus.

Many of these will be referred to as Top-30 visits, which can include physicals (but no on-field workouts)\n\nOne last thing: Video and telephone interviews with draft-eligible players can begin. There is a limit of three video or phone interviews per player.

Having the opportunity to meet those kids and see this experience through their eyes and see how excited they were re-inspires me,\u201d Schieler said.\n\nSeattle Seahawks nominated fan Larry Bevans took home the NFL Fan of the Year Award the NFL Honors Ceremony on Saturday.\n\nJake Fogal can be reached at Jacob.Fogal@Cumulus.com.",

It's officially the offseason and all eyes turn to the NFL Draft.\n\nThe Bears own the No. 1 overall pick, and speculation about what Chicago can and do with the pick is already rampant. There are some that say the Bears should trade Justin Fields and draft Bryce Young to reset the rookie quarterback contract.\n\nBut one NFL coach explains why the Bears shouldn't trade Fields.\n\nGet Chicago local news, weather forecasts, sports and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Chicago newsletters.\n\n\"[The Bears] had no business being in some of the games they were in this year -- that was because of Fields,\" an anonymous NFL coach told ESPN.\n\nIt's true, the Bears lost a decent amount of single-score games, even with their awful roster.\n\nIn mid-December the Bears lost to the eventual NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles by just give points. The Bears were beating the Buffalo Bills at half-time of that game.\n\nIn October, the Bears had a lead over the Minnesota Vikings going into the final three minutes of the game. At the end of October, the Bears scored 29 points on the Dallas Cowboys. At that point in the season, the Cowboys defense had only let one team score more than 20 points - the Eagles.\n\nThere was a three-game stretch in November where the Bears lost by a combined seven points to the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons. It's almost a miracle the Bears got the No. 1 overall pick given how many games they almost won, and it will benefit the franchise in the long-run.\n\nTo be fair, there are a decent amount of pundits and analysts saying you don't trade Fields.\n\n\"My whole this is, I've seen enough out of Justin Fields to know that I want him to be my quarterback for the next few years,\" Peter King told NBC Sports Chicago\u2019s Josh Schrock.\n\nKing also wouldn't think Fields has to prove he is the franchise quarterback this year.\n\n\"I think what happens in the NFL today \u2013 and I live in New York, and I saw it with Zach Wilson this year,\" King said. \"Essentially, Zach Wilson, this year, everybody in New York has decided 'Okay, get him out. He can't do it. Bring on the next guy.' Now, I think that is just absolutely stupid, and would be stupid if the Bears this year, if Justin Fields is not a top-12 quarterback this year, (say) we gotta move on from him.\"\n\nKing added: \"I don't know how it's gonna end up with Justin Fields, all I do know is, first of all, I definitely wouldn't be thinking of trading him. Definitely. And I wouldn't be thinking that it's this year, or we've got to move on.\"\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bears' 2022 season was supposed to be a new chapter. The team started the offseason by hiring Ryan Poles away from the Chiefs as their new general manager. Poles then brought on Colts defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus as his first head coach and Packers quarterbacks coach Luke Getsy to be Chicago's offensive coordinator. With Justin Fields entering his second season and getting a new staff to work with, this was supposed to be the start of a turnaround. Instead, Chicago got more of the same. They fell to three wins despite Fields making a jaw-dropping play seemingly every week. Chicago also set a franchise record for losses in a season, though an extra week of football was needed to get there. Fields' emergence offered the team hope for 2023, but the numbers say they still have a long way to go.\n\nKey Offensive Stats\n\nPoints per game: 19.2 (23rd)\n\nEPA per play: -0.04 (23rd)\n\nDropback EPA per play: -0.07 (27th)\n\nPassing yards per game: 130.5 (32nd)\n\nRush EPA per play: 0 (6th)\n\nRush yards per game: 177.3 (1st)\n\nStarting with some positives, Fields gave us one of the best seasons on the ground in the history of the league. He broke off four runs of 40 or more yards. That was more than Nick Chubb and Josh Jacobs combined. He also set the record for yards per carry (7.1) in a season on at least 150 attempts. The rest of the team had little to offer, as evidenced by Fields' 2,242 passing yards at 7.1 yards per throw. Coming off a 1,000-yard season, Darnell Mooney's numbers plummeted. The speedy wideout reached just 493 yards before going down with a season-ending ankle injury. Chase Claypool, acquired midway through the year from Pittsburgh, didn't make much of an impact in his few games with the team. The line did show some signs of life with left tackle Braxton Jones and right guard Teven Jenkins both receiving strong grades from Pro Football Focus.\n\nKey Defensive Stats\n\nPoints per game: 27.2 (32nd)\n\nEPA per play: 0.12 (32nd)\n\nDropback EPA per play: 0.21 (32nd)\n\nPassing yards per game: 218.6 (17th)\n\nRush EPA per play: 0.02 (28th)\n\nRush yards per game: 157.3 (31st)\n\nStory continues\n\nChicago had one defensive player ranked as a top-32 option at their respective position by PFF. That was safety Eddie Jackson, who finished the year on injured reserve. The Bears ranked last in the NFL in sacks per game and didn't have corners who could mask their weak pass-rush with lockdown coverage. They ultimately allowed more yards per pass attempt than any other team. Their run-defense, weakened by the team trading away Roquan Smith, didn't fair much better.\n\nBears 2023 Offseason\n\nThe Bears have plenty of players who are under contract for 2023 and would be cut candidates for most teams. However, they have nearly $40 million more than any other team in cap space, so the savings are all but useless to them. The Claypool trade stings in hindsight as it sent off the No. 32 overall pick.\n\nTeam Needs\n\nWide Receiver\n\nDespite trading for Claypool, the Bears are still light at receiver. Fields has room to grow as a passer, but he needs better help to allow that to happen. With strong vertical threats in Claypool and Mooney, and threat over the middle of the field makes sense for the roster.\n\nDefensive End\n\nIn 2022, 88 players notched at least five sacks. Not a single one of them played for the Bears. They need a pass-rushing defensive end but could also opt for a tackle given the lack of talent across their entire line.\n\nOffensive Tackle\n\nThe Bears got some surprising performances from their offensive line, but the unit is a weak-link system. With Riley Reiff likely departing in free agency, the team needs to find an answer at right tackle.\n\nCoaching Changes\n\nBears DBs coach James Rowe left for a college gig, but the rest of the team remains intact. Though Chicago was the easiest team to pass on by many metrics, Rowe did get solid performances out of some young players, including Jaquan Brisker and Kyler Gordon, who combined for four interceptions and as many sacks. The Bears could experience more impactful coaching turnover next offseason if they don't turn things around in 2023.\n\nOffseason Outlook\n\nAfter stealing the top pick in the draft just before the clock struck midnight, the Bears are in the rare position of needing to trade away the most valuable selection. Early reports have indicated that is their plan as opposed to moving Fields. The Colts, Falcons, and Panthers are all strong candidates to move up for a quarterback. Chicago's first order of business in the offseason will be extracting the most value possible from the top spot in the draft. With as many holes as the Bears have, trading down multiple times can't hurt. The Bears can also afford to spend in free agency. The rolling salary minimum means they have to. A few marquee free agents\u2014Marcus Peters and Orlando Brown come to mind\u2014will be pricey but fill Chicago's needs well. Front-loading hefty contracts to allow for more freedom in future years, once Fields needs an extension, would be the ideal outcome. The Bears could be a fringe playoff team in 2023, but this offseason has to be about building a Super Bowl roster farther down the road.",

As a result, he\u2019ll take pointers from two all-time great quarterbacks.\n\nChicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields took a big step in his development. He had the second-best rushing season by a quarterback in NFL history (falling just 64 yards short of Lamar Jackson\u2018s rushing record). However, he did have the most rushing yards by a quarterback in a game when he ran for 178 yards against the Miami Dolphins in Week 9.\n\nThe knock on him, though, is that he needs to develop more in the passing game. He completed 60.4 percent of his passes but had only 2,242 yards and 17 touchdowns. Additionally, he threw 11 interceptions.\n\nOf course, some of that had to do with the lack of wide receiver targets (especially when Darnell Mooney went down) and protection ( he was sacked 55 times, most in the league). However, he sometimes did hold onto the ball too long trying to make a play. Also, he has to protect the ball more (he fumbled a league-high 16 times).\n\nFields is hitting his third offseason putting in even more work than the previous two. He\u2019ll also be looking at what general manager Ryan Poles adds to the offense through free agency and the draft. He will want to meet and start working with his new teammates as soon as possible so everyone can be on the same page when the season begins.\n\nFields will look for help anywhere he can get it\n\nIn addition to working with his teammates, Fields will also receive some help from some all-time greats. One of them is actually a hated rival of the Chicago Bears.\n\nOffensive coordinator Luke Getsy was the quarterbacks coach with the Green Bay Packers. He worked with future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Fields spoke to Getsy so he could get his telephone number so he could reach out to Rodgers.\n\nI try to, you know, get guys\u2019 opinions after the game. Our offensive coordinator last year [Luke Getsy], he was with Green Bay. So I reached out to him and grabbed Aaron\u2019s number. So, just going to reach out to him.\n\nYes, the \u201cI still own you\u201d Rodgers will be giving Fields some pointers. Shouldn\u2019t a team owner help the franchise quarterback improve?\n\nFans may hate Rodgers but no one can deny his abilities. He is one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history and him helping Fields is a great thing for Fields. Fields can soak up the advice and go out and put it into action.\n\nFields isn\u2019t stopping there, however. He also revealed that head coach Matt Eberflus recently met with Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Eberflus will get Fields in contact with Young so he can give the young quarterback some advice as well.\n\nGetting advice from two all-time greats can only be good for Fields. It shows he is eager to do whatever it takes to get better. Some young players won\u2019t take the time to ask advice from other, older figures. They might feel that they\u2019ve been doing well up to this point so they\u2019ll continue doing things their way.\n\nFields understands that he needs to get as much information as possible and also add his way so he can become the best possible player. He doesn\u2019t even mind meeting with a hated rival if it means he gets better.\n\nIf Poles does his job and gets the help Fields needs, Fields has to be ready to show that he has the ability to step up and play great. So far, he is showing that he has the work ethic to be great.",

He will want to meet and start working with his new teammates as soon as possible so everyone can be on the same page when the season begins.\n\nFields will look for help anywhere he can get it\n\nIn addition to working with his teammates, Fields will also receive some help from some all-time greats. One of them is actually a hated rival of the Chicago Bears.\n\nOffensive coordinator Luke Getsy was the quarterbacks coach with the Green Bay Packers. He worked with future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Fields spoke to Getsy so he could get his telephone number so he could reach out to Rodgers.\n\nI try to, you know, get guys\u2019 opinions after the game. Our offensive coordinator last year [Luke Getsy], he was with Green Bay. So I reached out to him and grabbed Aaron\u2019s number. So, just going to reach out to him.\n\nYes, the \u201cI still own you\u201d Rodgers will be giving Fields some pointers. Shouldn\u2019t a team owner help the franchise quarterback improve?\n\nFans may hate Rodgers but no one can deny his abilities. He is one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history and him helping Fields is a great thing for Fields. Fields can soak up the advice and go out and put it into action.\n\nFields isn\u2019t stopping there, however. He also revealed that head coach Matt Eberflus recently met with Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Eberflus will get Fields in contact with Young so he can give the young quarterback some advice as well.\n\nGetting advice from two all-time greats can only be good for Fields. It shows he is eager to do whatever it takes to get better. Some young players won\u2019t take the time to ask advice from other, older figures. They might feel that they\u2019ve been doing well up to this point so they\u2019ll continue doing things their way.\n\nFields understands that he needs to get as much information as possible and also add his way so he can become the best possible player. He doesn\u2019t even mind meeting with a hated rival if it means he gets better.\n\nIf Poles does his job and gets the help Fields needs, Fields has to be ready to show that he has the ability to step up and play great. So far, he is showing that he has the work ethic to be great.",

            "text": "No more state legislators introducing Chicago Bears stadium-funding bills even they don\u2019t support this week, but there have been a couple of new-ish developments-ish:\n\nA telephone poll of Chicago voters found they overwhelmingly oppose the team moving to suburban Arlington Heights (duh) by a 52-23% margin, and they oppose spending public money on upgrades to Soldier Field as well (also duh), by 51-42%. \u201cThe city voters want to keep the team, without a doubt, but they\u2019re not crazy about going into their own pockets to keep the owners happy,\u201d said pollster Brad Coker, which, well, what part of \u201cduh\u201d didn\u2019t you understand?\n\nA Chicago TV-sports-reporter-turned-YouTuber says that according to \u201cmultiple sources connected to Arlington Park\u201d that racetrack employees are being told they need to vacate their offices by end of day tomorrow, in anticipation of the Bears closing on the property sooner than later.\n\nAll of which is a good opportunity to step back and ask: What, exactly, are the Bears owners doing here? They appear to be moving full speed ahead with plans for a move to a new stadium, but have said they only want to build one if they can get \u201cproperty tax certainty\u201d \u2014 i.e., kickbacks of property taxes above a certain level \u2014 to pay for infrastructure at the site, along with maybe special business taxes or parking taxes or other tax money. That seems like it will be a heavy lift, given that a property tax kickback would require state legislation, and lots of state legislators are from Chicago which would be losing its team, and lots of other state legislators are from downstate and don\u2019t have any reason to help Arlington Heights provide tax kickbacks to the Bears, and the governor is opposed to the plan, and also as noted even the bill\u2019s sponsor isn\u2019t sure she\u2019s in favor of it.\n\n(Still no estimates of how much tax would end up being kicked back in total, incidentally, but here\u2019s the language of the bill that would establish a payments in lieu of taxes system for \u201cmegaprojects,\u201d which is crafted to apply specifically to the Bears proposal. Yes, the language exempting megaprojects from regular property taxes is amended to a section establishing tax exemptions for breast pumps, there is nothing amusing about this, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re laughing.)\n\nThere are several possible theories here: 1) The Bears owners know the Arlington Heights project isn\u2019t going anywhere, but are just using it as a threat to shake loose renovation cash from the city of Chicago; 2) They know they\u2019re unlikely to get tax breaks, but they\u2019re willing to go ahead with borrowing $5 billion to build a new stadium and an entire new neighborhood because it\u2019s such a great business deal; or 3) They think that by making PILOT money available to all \u201cmegaprojects,\u201d they can lure in legislators from the rest of the state who might want to use a similar financing scheme in their own districts. I would characterize those as 1) possible but risky, though it\u2019s not like the Bears can\u2019t re-sell the racetrack property if the stadium thing doesn\u2019t work out, 2) almost certainly idiotic but hey, it\u2019s their money, and 3) optimistic to say the least, but all are conceivable explanations, as is 4) Throw as many stadium plans against the wall as they can, and hope that it shakes some public subsidy money loose from somewhere. Dumber Hail Marys have worked before, so why not?",

            "text": "Chicago Bears fans experienced a roller coaster of emotions in Week 18 monitoring the Texans game against Indianapolis. The rights to the No. 1 overall selection were on the line and Houston held a two score advantage with less than one minute remaining in the third quarter. The Colts, aided by two Davis Mills interceptions, scored touchdowns on consecutive possessions to take a lead. With 50 seconds remaining, Mills found tight end Jordan Akins for what would be the game-winning touchdown.\n\nSimultaneously, the Bears were taken care of at home by the Vikings to secure the No. 1 overall selection. The question now is, what should Chicago do with that selection?\n\nIn an ideal world, the franchise would be able to trade down while maintaining a position inside the top-4, which seemingly ensures that they have an opportunity to select either Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson or Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter, in addition to adding much needed assets to rebuild the roster. First-year general manager Ryan Poles can either trade with a team that currently holds one of those selections or dictate that any potential trade include a third team leaving a path for the Bears to land either Anderson or Carter.\n\nIn three seasons with the Crimson Tide, Anderson has accumulated 34.5 sacks. Over the past two seasons, the Georgia native has generated 137 pressures; 17 more than the next most. Rookie safety Jaquan Brisker led Chicago with four sacks this season. The team finished with the fewest sacks in the league.\n\nThe Bears also allowed 157.3 rushing yards per game, which was the second most in the NFL. There is a need for both Carter and Anderson so either should be welcomed.\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick has not be traded since the Rams moved up from No. 15 overall in 2016 to select quarterback Jared Goff. Theoretically, any team willing to trade up to No. 1 overall would be doing so for a quarterback. Houston (No. 2 overall), Indianapolis (No. 4 overall), Seattle (No. 5 overall), Detroit (No. 6 overall), Las Vegas (No. 7 overall), Atlanta (No. 8 overall) and Carolina (No. 9 overall) could be in the market to add a rookie quarterback. A bevy of potential suitors indicates that it could be a seller's market, which would lead to a higher trade return.\n\nIf Chicago is not offered a pick that would essentially guarantee the chance to select one of those two defenders, then they have a decision to stay put and pick either or take the trade and add a lesser caliber player. The 2023 NFL Draft class is relatively top heavy with a chasm between the quarterbacks, two defenders and the next best available.\n\nIt would be difficult to bypass either of those players knowing the risk that comes with picking later in the round. Poles should either stick and pick one of those two defenders or trade back if they feel comfortable that either Carter or Anderson will be available.\n\nThe organization also has needs to address along the offensive line, linebacker and wide receiver.\n\nThe 2023 NFL Draft is to take place from April 27-29 in Kansas City, Missouri. Chicago's second selection comes from Baltimore in the Roquan Smith trade. The Bears sent their own second round choice to Pittsburgh in exchange for wide receiver Chase Claypool, who averaged 20 receiving yards per game with his new team.",

The team is likely to stick with Justin Fields as starting quarterback and build around him, while also looking for insurance at QB through the draft. With Super Bowl LVII now over, teams can begin making moves during this offseason period such as free agency and franchise tags. NFL coach Peter King believes that Fields doesn't need to prove himself further as a franchise QB, but the Bears must make changes like finding better help for Fields at wide receiver and defensive end if they want to be playoff contenders next year. Opposition from Illinois state government and local school districts regarding tax breaks are also hindering progress on the proposed stadium project."
