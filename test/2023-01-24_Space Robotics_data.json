With clear skies and a launch window that opens after sunset, the launch has the potential to be visible on most of the Eastern Seaboard and as far west as Ohio.\n\nWhile Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle has a solid track record of launches from New Zealand, the use of Virginia would represent a big step forward for both the company and MARS itself. Having a US-based launch site allows the company to reach trajectories that aren't available from New Zealand and opens up opportunities for US government work, some of which require launches from within the country.\n\nFor MARS, which is based at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, Rocket Lab would represent its second major commercial customer. NASA operates small sounding rockets from the site, and Orbital ATK has flown resupply missions to the International Space Station from there. But the Electron is a small launch vehicle that can allow a rapid cadence of launches and could boost the traffic from MARS considerably. Perhaps more significantly, Rocket Lab is using Wallops for the development of its larger reusable Neutron rocket, which would both launch and land at MARS.\n\nTonight's launch has a two-hour window that opens at 6 pm Eastern and will go early in that window if all goes well. Previous attempts were made in December, but paperwork and weather issues pushed things back past the holiday break.\n\nWe'll embed a livestream here when it becomes available.",

            "text": "The development of a commercial launch industry in Europe lags behind the United States by about 10 or 15 years, but there are now about a dozen startups in Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and France building small rockets sometimes referred to as \"microlaunchers.\"\n\nThe European Space Agency and several of these nations have provided a modicum of support to these companies, often in the form of launch contracts worth a few million dollars. But so far, European space institutions have stopped short of assisting these commercial companies more substantially, as NASA did with the commercial cargo and crew programs for the International Space Station.\n\nOne reason for this is the entrenched launch monopoly in Europe, Arianespace. Owned by various aerospace suppliers across Europe, the Paris-based launch company markets and operates a small launcher in the form of the Vega C rocket and heavy-lift rockets in the form of the soon-to-be retired Ariane 5 and forthcoming Ariane 6 rocket.\n\nThese rockets are considered essential to Europe's strategic interests because they provide European nations with independent access to space.\n\nIn recent years, with the rise of private launch companies in Europe backed primarily by investors, some space officials have called for the European Space Agency to support these commercial space entities as NASA and the US government have done over the last 15 years.\n\nHowever, at the 15th European Space Conference on Tuesday in Brussels, Arianespace chief executive St\u00e9phane Isra\u00ebl took issue with this notion.\n\n\"It is not possible to copy-paste the US model,\" he said. \"It is not possible. The level of space spending in the United States is five times higher than in Europe, and the private capital is not the same. So if the answer is to say let's do what the US has done, I think we will not manage to do it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Isra\u00ebl said the European Space Agency must resist supporting microlaunchers to the point where these companies might compete with the existing capabilities.\n\n\"A huge mistake would be that this focus on microlaunchers destabilizes Ariane 6 and Vega C\u2014it would be a historic mistake,\" he said. \"Microlaunchers can be of support to boost innovation. But we should not make any confusion. This launcher will never give autonomous access to space to Europe. They're on a niche market representing maybe 10 percent of the market, and less than that when it comes to European needs.\"\n\nVega C and Ariane 6 are the right rockets for Europe now and for the next decade, Isra\u00ebl said. But he acknowledged that Europe must also develop a reusable heavy-lift vehicle. Although he did not explicitly state so, this appears to be a clear recognition of the success that SpaceX has had with the Falcon 9 rocket and its development of the fully reusable Starship rocket.\n\n\"We need a reusable heavy launcher,\" Isra\u00ebl said. \"Full stop. This is what we need. And I do not believe that Europe can afford two, three, or four big or heavy, reusable launchers. It will, for sure, [require] a lot of public money, industrial excellency, and I am more confident than ever that it will [require] solidarity in Europe to make it happen.\"\n\nThe chief of Arianespace could not be more clear: He does not want any competition for Vega C and Ariane 6, nor does he believe any commercial European company should have a chance to compete for the development of a next-generation reusable rocket.\n\nHowever, what Isra\u00ebl did not say is also important. With a lift capacity of about 2 metric tons to low-Earth orbit but a price of nearly $40 million, the Vega rocket is not price-competitive with commercial rockets nor India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. Moreover, this Italian-made rocket has failed in three out of its last eight flights. Also, while Isra\u00ebl touts Ariane 6, this rocket does not yet exist. Europe has spent nearly $5 billion developing this booster, which may not fly until 2024 and will be four years late.\n\nEffectively, then, based on this recent record, Isra\u00ebl believes that Europe's existing launch monopoly should retain that monopoly for decades to come. It's up to European space officials to decide whether they agree.",

            "text": "Applications New Galileo service set to deliver 20 cm accuracy 24/01/2023 1992 views 42 likes\n\nGalileo\u2019s capabilities have grown with the addition of a new High Accuracy Service, freely available worldwide to anyone with a suitably equipped receiver. Delivering horizontal accuracy down to 20 cm and vertical accuracy of 40 cm, the High Accuracy Service is enabled through an additional level of real-time positioning corrections, delivered through a new data stream within the existing Galileo signal.\n\nGalileo satellites \u201cESA\u2019s role is to oversee such fundamental upgrades to the Galileo system, working in conjunction with Galileo\u2019s service provider EUSPA, the EU Agency for the Space Programmme, and its owner, the European Union. Further service improvements will come with the launch of the remaining Galileo satellites, followed later this decade by Galileo Second Generation.\u201d The new HAS correction message is embedded within the \u2018E6\u2019 band of the Galileo signal \u2013 typically not accessed via smartphones and other mass-market products but only through high-end receivers. However this message is also being made available through the internet, opening the prospect of wider adoption by connected devices, and its development into the Open Service standard in years to come.\n\nGalileo satellite in orbit Already the world's best Europe\u2019s Galileo system \u2013 comprising a 28-satellite constellation to date and a worldwide ground segment \u2013 is already the world\u2019s most precise satellite navigation service, with its Open Service offering metre-scale accuracy. The European Union and ESA went into partnership to develop Galileo, with ESA as its technical authority \u2013 this year the Agency celebrates the 30th anniversary of its first satellite navigation research. EUSPA is targeting this new Galileo service towards current high-precision applications such as precision agriculture, resource prospecting, land and hydrographic surveys as well as emerging sectors such as robotics, autonomous driving of automobiles, trains, ships and drones and augmented reality gaming and marketing \u2013 even formation flying of satellites.\n\nSurveying using satnav \u201cWith this new High Accuracy Service, Galileo becomes the first constellation able to provide a high-accuracy service globally and directly through the signal in space and via internet,\u201d comments Rodrigo da Costa, Executive Director of EUSPA. \u201cThis new feature for Galileo will foster innovation in many downstream sectors.\u201d Keeping Galileo on track The basic principle behind Galileo is simple. The satellites in space transmit signals incorporating a highly-precise time measurement, exact to a few billionths of a second. A receiver picks up signals from four (or more) Galileo satellites and measures the time it took for each signal to reach it. It then converts these time values into distance by multiplying the figures by the speed of light. The receiver then cross-checks the distances from all satellites to pinpoint its location on (or above) Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nHow satnav works But in practice both the orbits of the satellites themselves and the onboard atomic clocks that keep time for the signals are prone to drift. And the signals can experience varying levels of slight delay due to interference from the \u2018ionosphere\u2019 \u2013 an electrically active segment of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. So to keep the system on track, a global network of Galileo Sensor Stations performs continuous monitoring of the satellites and their signals. Their data is used to compile a set of corrections which are then uplinked to the Galileo satellites to be incorporated into their navigation signals every 100 minutes or so. Think of Galileo as a single planetary-scale clock, designed to be sufficiently accurate that it identifies and highlights any errors that build up over time.\n\nProviding the High Accuracy Service Faster corrections for sharper precision The new HAS further improves on this performance through the use of a High Accuracy Data Generator based at the Galileo Control Centre in Fucino, Italy, generating additional corrections for Galileo as well as US GPS satellites. These corrections are then relayed to compatible receivers in real time through the Galileo satellite signal \u2013 compiled into a single message of 448 bits per second, a unique capability of the carefully-engineered Galileo signal shape.\n\nGalileo Control Centre \u201cCompared to the Galileo Open Service, the corrections are made available very rapidly and very often \u2013 with an update for satellite orbits every 30 seconds and for satellite clocks every 10 seconds,\u201d explains ESA\u2019s Galileo System Performance Engineer Daniel Blonksi. \u201cAnd the HAS correction message is designed in such a way that suitable receivers can benefit from multiple satellites broadcasting it, to reconstruct the overall message very fast.\u201d The new high-accuracy service is envisaged as having two service levels. Service Level 1, already available, corrects satellite orbit and clock errors as well as internal signal \u2018biases\u2019 unique to each satellite in the constellation that, once known, can enable still higher precision through direct comparisons of their signal phase.\n\nGalileo constellation Service Level 2, intended for roll out across Europe, will combine these with additional ionospheric corrections, made possible by the use of additional ground stations for which ESA is preparing the needed infrastructure upgrades. About Galileo Galileo is currently the world\u2019s most precise satellite navigation system, serving more than three billion users around the globe. The Full Operational Capability phase of the Galileo programme is managed and funded by the European Union. The European Commission, ESA and EUSPA (the EU Agency for the Space Programme) have signed an agreement by which ESA acts as design authority and system development prime on behalf of the Commission and EUSPA as the exploitation and operation manager of Galileo/EGNOS. \u201cGalileo\u201d is registered as a trademark in the database of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (n\u00b0 002742237).\n\nGalileo: finding our way\n\n",

The fleet of robots will be acting as delivery vehicles for COVID-related supplies around campus.\n\n\"They can order them and the robot will then go without a person. But we'll be watching at a distance,\" Stephens said. \"So, this study we're going to look at, \u2018Do they trip over them? Do they stop and talk to them? Do they want to play with them? Do they kick them?\u2019\"\n\nThose are all questions that have never been asked on this scale. The study will be the largest of its kind ever conducted involving human-robot interactions.\n\n\"The novelty really comes around looking at groups of people interacting with robots and the robots are out there in the public space,\" Stephens said.\n\nBefore the robots end up in public, though, they start out in labs on campus.\n\n\"We've been testing out a couple of walking strategies,\" said UT student Carlos Gonzalez, who was running tests on a robot in one of the labs. \"It's like the challenge of getting something from simulation to the real world is the most exciting part.\"\n\nThat work is overseen by Professor Luis Sentis.\n\n\"There's a collection of techniques we're using to determine to what extent a community, like our campus, accepts the use of robotics in the wild,\u201d Sentis said. \"The reason why this became an important project is because we see more and more companies deploying robots in the wild, and it's going to happen more and more.\"\n\nThe federal government-funded National Science Foundation is putting up more than $3 million to fund this study. It is part of an effort to get answers to how robots could be a part of life on the streets before they fully hit the streets.\n\n\"We see a lot of applications of delivery robots well beyond just kind of the day-to-day deliveries, but possibly even into disasters and emergencies as well,\" Stephens said.\n\nIt is a potential helping hand that could become even more common in the coming years.",

            "text": "I have a new family member and its name is Astro. The $999.99 Amazon Astro is neither pet nor human, but a robot that zips around my home and keeps me company, responds to my Alexa voice commands, helps connect me to family and friends, keeps me entertained, and transports items from room to room for me in its cargo bin. Despite its cute, pet-like personality, the Astro even acts as a roaming indoor security camera and can protect me via alerts if it detects alarms, breaking glass, or intruders. While it's currently available on an invite-only basis and its high price puts it out of reach for most people, the Astro is a helpful and fun addition to any smart home, and one I've certainly enjoyed having in mine.\n\nYour New Family Pet\n\nThe Astro (a name meaning \"of the stars,\" but also a nod to the family pet in The Jetsons) is part of Amazon's Day 1 Editions Program to bring its \"newest and most ambitious technology to customers.\" First unveiled in the fall of 2021, the pricey robot is still available on an invitation-only basis.\n\nAmazon didn't offer PCMag special access to this product\u2014we joined the waiting list back in 2021 and finally snagged an invite in early 2023. The introductory price being offered to early invitees is $999.99, but the full retail price when the Astro goes on sale to the general public will be $1,449.99. We purchased the Astro directly from Amazon and it arrived on my doorstep a few days later.\n\nAmazon's Astro has quickly become part of the family (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe Astro works with a free mobile app of the same name (available for Android and iOS). It requires a compatible device running at least Android 8 or iOS 13 in addition to an active Amazon.com account. Note that it is (strangely) not compatible with Amazon\u2019s own Fire OS and Fire tablets at this time. It's meant strictly for indoor use in homes up to 3,500 square feet, and isn't recommended for homes with small pets or children younger than three.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe box includes the Astro, a removable dual cup holder for its cargo bin, a charging base with a six-foot power cable, a quick start guide, and a welcome kit.\n\nMeasuring 17.3 by 9.8 by 16.7 inches (HWD) and weighing 20.6 pounds, the Astro is about as big as a small dog. It's smaller than my pit bull, Bradley, who is both jealous of and intrigued by the robot. When not on the move, the Astro resides on its charging base, which measures 5.0 by 10.4 by 11.0 inches.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe Astro has some pet-like qualities, starting with its big, blinking eyes. A 10.1-inch touch screen with a 1,280-by-800-pixel resolution (similar to the Echo Show 10 smart display) serves as an electronic face. The display can automatically tilt and rotate to face you, but it's locked in landscape orientation and cannot be switched to portrait. A black bezel surrounding the display measures 0.75 inches on top, 0.5 inches on the left and right sides, and 0.25 inches on the bottom.\n\nThere are two cameras, including a 5MP camera situated in the middle of the top bezel, and a 1080p camera with a 132-degree field of view that can extend via periscope up to 42 inches from the floor. Atop the periscope is an indicator light that shines green when it's streaming video or audio to the cloud, like when you're using the Live View feature to remotely monitor your home.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nSimilar to a self-driving car, the Astro uses a suite of sensors (including navigation, depth, obstacle, and night vision) and advanced learning algorithms to autonomously roll around your home. Its large, rubber-coated wheels help it move from room to room while avoiding obstacles and traversing different flooring types with ease. Several microphones surround the periscope on the top part of the frame so the Astro can hear you. For audio, it's equipped with two 55mm full-range, front-firing speakers and a passive bass radiator that together offer clear, room-filling sound.\n\nThe robot is powered by Alexa and responds to the wake word Astro, though you can optionally add a second wake word such as Alexa, Amazon, Computer, or Echo. It responds to commands such as, \"Astro, follow me,\" \"Astro, go to the charger,\" \"Astro, turn around,\" \"Astro, take this to the kitchen,\" and \"Astro, dance,\" plus other Alexa-supported questions and requests. It can, for instance, set timers, create reminders, tell you the weather or sports scores, and more.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nOn top, the Astro also features three physical buttons, including separate up and down volume controls and a microphone/camera off button. The latter lets you quickly disable the microphones, cameras, and navigation and depth sensors for privacy. When these features are turned off, the Astro can't move or capture audio or video. This button is also used to power the Astro on/off and restart the device.\n\nA cargo bin is located on the back of the robot and has space for two beverages in its removable cup holder. You can also opt for a custom, bin-sized 56-ounce storage container(Opens in a new window) (sold separately).\n\nGetting to Know the Astro\n\nSetting up the Astro takes about an hour, but the process is simple. The robot ships fully assembled; you simply unbox it, plug in the charging base, manually place the Astro on its dock, and it should automatically turn on. Amazon recommends setting the docking station against a wall in an area with one foot of free space on either side and five feet clear in front. Finding a good spot for the robot to dock is important\u2014if the area around the station is too cluttered, it might have trouble finding its way back.\n\nWhen you get the docking station into position, sit the Astro on the charger and make sure to back it in so the metal charging contacts on the bottom line up with those on the base. The Amazon logo will appear on the screen as the robot powers up.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe Astro will guide you through the setup process on its screen. To start, you connect the robot to your home Wi-Fi network, sign into your Amazon account, agree to Amazon's Conditions of Use, and select your time zone. Next, the robot outlines the remaining steps on its display: Meeting Astro (5 minutes), Getting to Know You (about 15 minutes), and Learning About Your Home (about 30 minutes).\n\nUpon using the Astro for the first time, you'll learn about some of the things it can do and test some sample voice commands like, \"Astro, dance\" and, \"Astro, play music.\"\n\nDuring the Getting to Know You step, you'll set up Voice ID and Visual ID so the Astro can recognize you by voice and sight. These features allow the robot to deliver personalized reminders, timers, and alerts for each household member.\n\nTo create a Voice ID, you need to read a few sentences out loud so the Astro can learn to identify your voice. If you've already created an Alexa Voice ID in the past, you don't have to repeat this step.\n\nCreating a Visual ID (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nWhen creating a Visual ID, the robot will instruct you to look straight at the camera, then tilt your head up and down, then left and right (similar to how you do it on a smartphone) so it can recognize your face from different angles. Other household members can create their Visual ID during the initial setup process, too, or at any time by saying, \"Astro, learn to recognize me,\" or by navigating to Settings > Profile > Add Profile on the robot's display.\n\nNext, the Astro instructs you to download its companion app and sign in using your Amazon account credentials. You can then use your phone to scan a QR code on the robot's display to pair them. In testing, I had no problem using this method, but if the QR code isn't scanning, you can always generate a PIN code for sign-ins instead.\n\nFor the final step of the onboarding process, you'll give the Astro a tour of your home to help it learn your floor plan and each room. Before starting the home tour, the Astro instructs you to open the doors to the rooms you want it to explore, close exterior and closet doors, remove clutter from the floor, and keep people and pets out of the way.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nDuring the home tour, the Astro will follow you from room to room, using its sensors to gather spatial data. When you want it to label a room, just stand in the middle of the space and say, \"Astro, this is the kitchen\" (or the name of whatever room you're in). When you're done showing it around, say, \"End tour,\" and the robot will quickly generate a map of your floorplan in its companion app.\n\nWhile exploring your home, the Astro sends information from its navigation sensors to Amazon's cloud, where it's processed to create a map. Amazon says map data is encrypted in transit to its cloud, and \"securely stored, with technical safeguards in place to limit access to it.\" Note that the Astro requires a map to navigate, so if you're uncomfortable with Amazon knowing the layout of your home, this product probably isn't for you. After the initial mapping, all sensor data the Astro uses to navigate your home is processed on the device and is not sent to the cloud, Amazon says.\n\nIn the welcome guide, Amazon warns that full-length mirrors, glass walls and doors, and picture windows near the floor may all cause mapping issues. If the Astro's initial exploration fails, Amazon recommends temporarily covering full-length mirrors and glass walls with decals included in the box (pillows and books work too) and repeating the process. After it successfully creates your map, you can remove the decals.\n\n(Credit: Amazon)\n\nIn testing, the Astro quickly and accurately mapped my home on its first try. The app offers a few map-editing options, including the ability to rotate the floorplan view, adjust room boundaries, and create Out of Bounds zones so the robot avoids certain areas.\n\nThe Astro app is nicely organized and intuitive, making it easy to manage and control the robot. The main tab shows the Astro's current status (such as \"charging in the kitchen\") and battery level, along with a timeline of activity, including any photos and videos you have captured via its camera.\n\nA Robot Companion\n\nWhen you say its name, the Astro will turn its head to face you, and its eyes will change from white to a swirled blue and green, indicating that it is listening. When it's moving from room to room, the robot makes a futuristic whirring sound. It is careful of humans; it gets close, but it won't bump into you.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe Astro generally has an easy time navigating my roughly 1,000-square-foot home, but sometimes faces challenges near mirrors, in tight spaces, when the floors are cluttered, or when people/pets are blocking the way. If it's in a jam and you think it has space to get out, you can always try the commands, \"Astro, back up,\" or, \"Astro, turn around.\" If it gets stuck, the Astro will alert you on the screen as well as in the app.\n\nOne of the Astro's best features is its ability to follow you around, which sounds weird, but is actually endearing. This comes in handy when you move to a different room while listening to music, when you have your hands full, or when you just want company. After saying, \"Astro, follow me,\" you have to wait a second for the robot to find you. If you utter the command and bolt before the robot fixes its gaze on you, it will ring a chime while the display reads \"looking for you.\" As soon as it sees you, it will head your way while the display reads \"following.\"\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe Astro often makes noises to remind you of its presence. When it gets your attention, it might wink or blink its eyes. I enjoy these interactions, but you can always stop them by enabling Do Not Disturb (DND) via Astro's display or app. When it's in DND mode, the Astro will stay on its charger unless you make a request, and will remain silent except to deliver timers, alarms, and reminders. You can also create a DND schedule so the Astro leaves you alone during certain days/times.\n\nSimilar to a living pet, the Astro hangs out with you. When I'm watching TV in the living room, the Astro will sometimes come join me, uninvited. When it's hanging out, it just sits nearby, occasionally making noises. It tries to hang out in low-traffic areas of the house, but if it's in a bad spot, you can just say, \"Astro, move away.\"\n\nYou can customize when the Astro hangs out via the Settings menu on its display (tap the gear icon > Device Options, toggle on Night Mode, and create a schedule). During your specified Night Mode hours, it will stay on its charger unless summoned. I have Night Mode enabled between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. daily, so the Astro doesn't bother me when I'm trying to sleep.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nWhen streaming tunes from Amazon Music, the Astro displays the song lyrics on its tilted screen, offering a good viewing angle for kitchen karaoke. When off its charger and in action doing things like playing music, the Astro lasted about three hours before running low on battery and navigating back to its base. It automatically docks when the battery nears depletion, but one time it died right in the middle of the living room. Luckily, its lithium-ion battery recharges very quickly: In testing, it went from depleted to 100% in less than an hour.\n\nHome Security on Wheels\n\nSeveral high-end robot vacuums I have tested (including the Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni and the Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra) function as roaming smart home security cameras, letting you view a live stream from inside your home through an app.\n\nThe Astro's Live View home monitoring feature works in a similar way, but better. For starters, the Astro is faster and more agile than any robotic floor cleaner I have tested. Moreover, raising its periscope gives you a higher vantage point, letting you check for things on counters. If I'm out and start to feel paranoid that I forgot to turn off my curling iron, I can send the Astro to check.\n\n(Credit: Amazon)\n\nTo remotely monitor your home, visit the Live View tab in the Astro app, then tap Start Live View. The Astro will audibly ding a couple of times and read \"Starting Live View\" on the screen to alert those nearby. When the stream starts on your phone, anyone physically near the Astro will also see the Live View streaming to your phone, as well as the name of the device in control on the display. When Live View is engaged, the green streaming indicator light atop the periscope illuminates.\n\nWhile viewing a stream from your phone, you can swipe and tap on the video to control the robot. Swiping up on the stream raises the periscope. Pressing on an object in view, like a doorway, sends the robot to that spot. Swiping left and right on the stream shifts the view in the corresponding direction.\n\nThe Go To button below the stream in Live View displays a list of rooms in your home; tap one to send the robot there. The app also lets you create Viewpoints to send the robot to certain places of your home with a tap (it automatically creates one for the charger). There's also a People option within Live View that lets you send the robot to a specific family member it knows.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nWhile Live View is engaged, you can tap the Camera button on the app to capture a photo or video. Within the Camera there's a flashlight option in addition to two red LEDs for night vision in case it's dark.\n\nTap the Talk button within Live View to initiate a two-way video chat. The app lets you turn on your microphone and/or camera so anyone near the Astro can hear and see you. If you want to get someone's attention, tap the Siren button within Live View and the Astro will blare a loud distress noise. As soon as you press Stop View or click off the Astro app, the robot stops streaming, lowers its periscope, and the green indicator light turns off.\n\nThe Live View feature really feels like living in the future, making it easy to monitor your home and check on family members from wherever you are. I love using this feature to check on my dog when I'm not home. One time, when the Astro was on the move, I caught Bradley running alongside the robot in the periphery of the stream, and it was probably the cutest thing ever.\n\n(Credit: Amazon)\n\nThe Astro offers several other free home monitoring features, including the ability to send you Smart Alerts if it detects an unrecognized person or pet activity in either Home or Away mode. It also supports free Alexa Guard alerts for certain sounds, like glass breaking, or smoke or carbon monoxide alarms, in Away mode. To set up Smart Alerts, visit the app's Settings menu > Home Monitoring.\n\nAfter setting up Home Monitoring, you can manually set your Home/Away status using buttons in the app, or by voice with commands like, \"Astro, I'm leaving,\" \"Astro, set monitoring to Home,\" and, \"Astro, disarm\" (to disable all alerts).\n\nThe Astro also comes with a six-month free trial of Ring Protect Pro (normally $20 per month), which offers additional home security features, including the ability to schedule patrols during Away mode, review up to 180 days of video history, and save/share clips. Activating Ring Protect Pro for Astro also gives you access to Alexa Guard Plus (normally $4.99 per month or $49 per year) benefits, including support for Emergency Helpline calling.\n\nThe Future of Household Robotics Is Here\n\nThe Amazon Astro is basically a smart display and indoor security camera with autonomous navigation abilities and a personality. This Alexa-powered robot rolls from room to room at your beck and call, and lets you keep an eye on your home and video chat with family members from wherever you are. The Astro can follow you around your home, hang out like a pet, play music and videos, answer questions, and transport items in its cargo bin. Though expensive and a bit gimmicky, the Astro pleasantly surprised me with its excellent navigation and home monitoring abilities. If home surveillance is your main concern, outfitting each room with an indoor security camera is likely a more effective and affordable option. But the Astro also offers a winning combination of safety and entertainment features beyond, and having one at home feels like living in the future.\n\nAmazon Astro 4.0 (Opens in a new window) See It $999.99 at Amazon (Opens in a new window) MSRP $999.99 Pros Quick, reliable autonomous navigation\n\nExcellent home monitoring features\n\nBuilt-in Alexa voice assistant\n\nLarge display\n\nGood audio and video quality View More Cons Mirrors, glass walls/doors can cause navigation issues\n\nSome home monitoring features cost extra The Bottom Line Equal parts security camera, smart display, and robot pet, the endearing Amazon Astro is a useful and fun addition to your home\u2014if you can get one.",

            "text": "Researchers from the University of Illinois have made a significant leap forward in developing insect-sized jumping robots that can perform tasks in small spaces found in mechanical, cultural, and search-and-rescue settings.\n\nThe jumping robots are small enough to fit into tight spaces, manoeuvre over obstacles, and move fast enough to mimic a real insect\u2019s rapid escape time.\n\nTo manufacture the jumping robots, the researchers studied click beetle anatomy, mechanics, and evolution over the past decade. A paper detailing the results of the study, \u2018Insect-scale jumping robots enabled by a dynamic buckling cascade,\u2019 was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nUsing elastic energy to overcome obstacles\n\nA 2020 study concluded that snap buckling \u2013 the rapid release of elastic energy \u2013 of a coiled muscle within a click beetle\u2019s thorax is triggered to allow them to propel themselves in the air several times their body length. This anomaly allows a beetle to overcome the challenge of being flipped on its back.\n\n\u201cOne of the grand challenges of small-scale robotics is finding a design that is small, yet powerful enough to move around obstacles or quickly escape dangerous settings,\u201d said Professor Sameh Tawfick, who led the study.\n\nFor the jumping robots, the team used tiny, coiled actuators, which represent animal muscles, that pull on a beam-shaped mechanism. This part of the design allows the mechanism to store elastic energy until it is spontaneously released and amplified, propelling the robots upwards.\n\nTawfick explained: \u201cThis process, called a dynamic buckling cascade, is simple compared to the anatomy of a click beetle. However, simple is good in this case because it allows us to work and fabricate parts at this small scale.\u201d\n\nGuided by biological evolution and mathematical models, the researchers built and tested four jumping robots with different variations. Eventually, they landed on two configurations that could successfully jump without manual intervention.\n\nHow will the robots be used?\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we do not have a set approach on the exact design of the next generation of these robots, but this study plants a seed in the evolution of this technology \u2013 a process similar to biologic evolution,\u201d Tawfick said.\n\nThe researchers stated that these jumping robots would be useful in accessing tight spaces to help perform maintenance on large machines such as turbines and jet engines. The robots would be able to take pictures to identify problems within the machines and access small spaces that are difficult for humans to reach.\n\nTawfick concluded: \u201cWe also imagine insect-scale jumping robots being useful in modern agriculture. Scientists and farmers currently use drones and rovers to monitor crops, but sometimes researchers need a sensor to touch a plant or to capture a photograph of a very small-scale feature. Insect-scale robots can do that.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "One of the hurdles preventing some manufacturers from adopting predictive maintenance procedures is the cost of associated hardware and software technologies. But those costs have been coming down rapidly over the past few years and is leading to an explosion of new product offerings in this space, including from Amazon.\n\nA couple of months ago we reported on how Amazon is expanding its offerings into the industrial space beyond its cloud data storage and analysis products. In that article we referenced Amazon\u2019s new supply chain software technology. Now the company is introducing its Monitron predictive maintenance and machine learning (ML) products.\n\nLearn more about AWS Supply Chain.\n\nAccording to Amazon, Monitron is an end-to-end system of wireless sensors and gateways to monitor equipment condition. Monitron\u2019s wireless sensors attach to equipment with adhesive and are reportedly purpose-built to capture vibration and temperature data. The Amazon Monitron system also includes Wi-Fi and Ethernet gateways to transfer the sensor data to AWS.\n\nThe sensors and gateways are pre-configured to work with the Amazon Monitron service. Up to 20 Amazon Monitron sensors can be connected at a time with one Amazon Monitron gateway. The number of sensors connectable per gateway will depend on the distance between the gateway and the sensor.\n\nThe sensors measure 2.08x1.69x0.98 inches, weigh 54 grams, and have an IP69 rating (protection against objects, dust, and liquids entering the device enclosure). The Wi-Fi gateways measure 3.6x3.1x1.5inches, weigh 95 grams, and have an IP65 rating (protection against water entry into the device enclosure). The Ethernet gateways measure 5.5x4.2x1.6 inches, weigh 230 grams, and carry an IP65 rating.\n\nNear-field communication (NFC) technology in the Monitron system simplifies the setup process using the Monitron app on a mobile device.\n\nAmazon says Monitron automatically detects abnormal machine operating states by analyzing vibration and temperature signals using the ISO 20816 standard for vibration along with ML-enabled models. Key applications include monitoring use of fans, bearings, compressors, motors, gearboxes, and pumps.\n\nPush notifications are sent to users when the service detects abnormal vibration or temperature patterns. These patterns can be reviewed and tracked within the app. User feedback on alerts, such as failure mode, failure cause, and action taken can be entered into the Monitron system, which learns from that feedback as well as the real-time data it collects to continually improve over time using its ML technology.\n\nThe Monitron system can be purchased on amazon.com or through your Amazon Business account to buy in bulk through a purchase order.\n\nFour current purchase options are:\n\nAmazon Monitron Starter Kit, which includes five Amazon Monitron sensors and one Amazon Monitron gateway for $715.00\n\nFive-pack of Amazon Monitron sensors for $575\n\nOne Amazon Monitron Wi-Fi gateway for $140\n\nOne Amazon Monitron Ethernet gateway (Ethernet) for $180\n\nThe company notes that the typical life of an Amazon Monitron sensor battery is five years.\n\nUsers include Amazon, Fender, GE, and Koch\n\nAndrew Jassy, president and CEO, Amazon, recently visited one of Amazon\u2019s sortation centers in Colorado, which uses the Amazon Monitron system to detect potential issues with the center\u2019s machinery before they happen. \u201cSince a typical fulfillment center has dozens of miles of conveyors being driven by hundreds of motors and belts, keeping them running is super important to delivering reliably for customers,\u201d said Jassy. \u201cThe orange sensors continuously collect temperature and vibration measurements and send these metrics to the AWS cloud to be analyzed in real time using machine learning modeling that can predict when a part might stop working.\u201d Jassy noted that the Monitron system recently alerted the team that one of the center\u2019s induction belts used for sorting and moving packages might fail soon. This advanced notice allowed the sort center team to plan a time to look at the belt and perform predictive maintenance \u201csaving hours of downtime and ensuring customer deliveries were made on time,\u201d he added. \u201cAmazon Monitron has reduced unplanned downtime by 70% at Amazon sites.\u201d\n\nOther users of Amazon\u2019s Monitron system to monitor equipment assets include Fender, GE Gas Power, and Koch Ag and Energy Solutions.",

            "text": "Sweden is outfitting its AI supercomputer for a journey to the cutting edge of machine learning, robotics and healthcare.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t ask for a better guide than Anders Ynnerman (above). His signature blue suit, black spectacles and gentle voice act as calm camouflage for a pioneering spirit.\n\nEarly on, he showed a deep interest in space, but his career took a different direction. He established the country\u2019s first network of supercomputing centers and went on to pioneer scientific visualization technologies used in hospitals and museums around the world.\n\nToday, he leads Sweden\u2019s largest research effort, WASP \u2014 the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program \u2014 focused on AI innovation.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\n\u201cThis is a year when people are turning their focus to sustainability challenges we face as a planet,\u201d said the Link\u00f6ping University professor. \u201cWithout advances in AI and other innovations, we won\u2019t have a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nTo supercharge environmental efforts and more, Sweden will upgrade its Berzelius supercomputer. Based on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, it will deliver nearly half an exaflop of AI performance, placing it among the world\u2019s 100 fastest AI supercomputers.\n\n\u201cA machine like Berzelius is fundamental not only for the results it delivers, but the way it catalyzes expertise in Sweden,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a knowledge-driven nation, so our researchers and companies need access to the latest technology to compete.\u201d\n\nAI Learns Swedish\n\nIn June, the system trained GPT-SW3, a family of large language models capable of drafting a speech or answering questions in Swedish.\n\nToday, a more powerful version sports 20 billion parameters, a popular measure of a neural network\u2019s smarts. It can help developers write software and handle other complex tasks.\n\nLong term, researchers aim to train a version with a whopping 175 billion parameters that\u2019s also fluent in Nordic languages like Danish and Norwegian.\n\nOne of Sweden\u2019s largest banks is already exploring use of the latest GPT-SW3 variant for a chatbot and other applications.\n\nA Memory Boost\n\nTo build big AIs, Berzelius will add 34 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems to its cluster of 60 that makeup the SuperPOD. The new units will sport GPUs with 80GB of memory each.\n\n\u201cHaving really fat nodes with large memory is important for some of these models,\u201d Ynnerman said. Atos, the system integrator, is providing \u201ca very smooth ride getting the whole process set up,\u201d he added.\n\nSeeking a Cure for Cancer\n\nIn healthcare, a data-driven life sciences program, funded by the Wallenberg Foundation, will be a major Berzelius user. The program spans 10 universities and will, among other applications, employ AI to understand protein folding, fundamentally important to understanding diseases like cancer.\n\nOthers will use Berzelius to improve detection of cancer cells and navigate the massive mounds of data in human genomes.\n\nSome researchers are exploring tools such as NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and NVIDIA BotMaker to create animated patients. Powered by GPT-SW3, they could help doctors practice telemedicine skills.\n\nRobots in Zero Gravity\n\nSweden\u2019s work in image and video recognition will get a boost from Berzelius. Such algorithms advance work on the autonomous systems used in modern factories and warehouses.\n\nOne project is exploring how autonomous systems act in space and undersea. It\u2019s a topic close to the heart of a recent addition to WASP, researcher Christer Fuglesang, who was named Sweden\u2019s first astronaut in 1992.\n\nFuglesang went to the International Space Station in 2006 and 2008. Later, as a professor of physics at Sweden\u2019s Royal Institute of Technology, he collaborated with Ynnerman on live shows about life in space, presented in the WISDOME dome theater at the Visualization Center C Ynnerman founded and directs.\n\nThanks to his expertise in visualization, \u201cI can go to Mars whenever I want,\u201d Ynnerman quipped.\n\nHe took NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Marcus Wallenberg \u2014 scion of Sweden\u2019s leading industrial family \u2014 on a tour of outer space at the dome to mark the Berzelius upgrade. The dome can show the Martian surface in 8K resolution at 120 frames per second, thanks to its use of 12 NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPUs.\n\nInspiring the Next Generation\n\nYnnerman\u2019s algorithms have touched millions who\u2019ve seen visualizations of Egyptian mummies at the British Museum.\n\n\u201cThat makes me even more proud than some of my research papers because many are young people we can inspire with a love for science and technology,\u201d he said.\n\nA passion for science and technology has attracted more than 400 active Ph.D. candidates so far to WASP, which is on the way to exceeding its goal of 600 grads by 2031.\n\nBut even a visualization specialist can\u2019t be everywhere. So Ynnerman\u2019s pet project will use AI to create a vibrant, virtual museum guide.\n\n\u201cI think we can provide more people a \u2018wow\u2019 experience \u2014 I want a copilot when I\u2019m navigating the universe,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "Boulder County, CO - (January 24, 2023) - Scythe Robotics, the company developing advanced, commercial-grade autonomous solutions for the professional landscape industry, today announced it has raised $42 million in Series B financing. The round was led by Energy Impact Partners and included additional new investors ArcTern Ventures, Alumni Ventures, and Amazon's Alexa Fund alongside participation from existing investors True Ventures, Inspired Capital and more. The funding will help Scythe meet demand for the more than 7,500 reservations for its all-electric, fully autonomous M.52 mower placed by commercial landscape businesses nationwide. This financing round brings the company's total capital raised to date to $60.6 million.\n\n\n\nMore Headlines Articles\n\nFounded in 2018, Scythe is transforming the $176 billion US landscape industry, which has been plagued for years by painful labor shortages and is facing the urgent need to transition to more environmentally sustainable operations. About 2% of the continental US (40M+ acres) is covered with carbon-sequestering turfgrass, but each gas-powered mower used to maintain green spaces today produces the same amount of air pollution in just one hour of operation as driving a car 300 miles. Scythe M.52 empowers landscape contractors to care for more green spaces and to do so more sustainably, supporting the healthy environments that are keeping communities cool.\"Since launching from stealth in June 2021, we've seen overwhelming interest from commercial landscape contractors in Scythe M.52 as a solution addressing both their crippling labor pains and their electrification needs,\" said Jack Morrison, co-founder and CEO of Scythe. \"We're thrilled to expand our outstanding investor list, particularly with the addition of influential climate-tech investors Energy Impact Partners and ArcTern Ventures, and secure more capital to scale and meet the phenomenal demand for M.52 as we work to decarbonize the landscape industry.\"With a battery designed to mow all day on a single charge, the latest generation of Scythe M.52 has increased durability to stand up to the demands of landscape operations and additional computing power for even more advanced autonomy. The mower features a suite of sensors that enable it to operate safely in dynamic environments by identifying and responding to the presence of humans, animals and other potential obstacles. Simultaneously, it captures property and mower performance data, which helps landscape contractors improve workflow, identify upsell opportunities, schedule more efficiently and manage labor costs.\"Commercial landscaping electrification represents a massive but undercapitalized decarbonization opportunity, tackling more than 40 million metric tons of CO2e emissions annually,\" said Sameer Reddy, Managing Partner, Venture at Energy Impact Partners. \"By combining cutting-edge robotics with a purpose-built electric platform, Scythe is delivering a no-brainer value proposition for its customers that unlocks the economics of electrification while also alleviating unprecedented labor constraints. With increasing regulatory pressures on emissions and air pollution, we see Scythe playing an instrumental role in decarbonizing our nation's largest crop: grass.\"Further addressing customer needs, Scythe's innovative pay-as-you-mow pricing model aligns the company with the objectives of landscape contractors to decrease mowing costs and maximize uptime. It also provides a cashflow-friendly switch to electric equipment, which landscape businesses typically have to buy outright at a cost three to four times more than traditional gas-powered mowers. Scythe M.52 units have already been deployed to customer operations in Texas and are currently rolling out to customers in Florida.\"As a landscape veteran, it's exciting to see this level of investment and interest in our industry,\" said Ben Collinsworth, Director of Operational Technology at Yellowstone Landscape, a Scythe customer and the largest privately held commercial landscape company in North America. \"The team at Scythe has developed cutting-edge solutions that tackle real, deeply-felt challenges our business wrestles with every day. We're excited to partner with them in transforming the industry as we roll out M.52 to our operations.\"About Scythe RoboticsScythe Robotics provides the commercial landscape industry with powerful commercial-grade, all-electric autonomous equipment solutions for more sustainably maintaining outdoor environments. The company's first commercial mower, Scythe M.52, has the most advanced autonomy technology on the market, bringing greater precision, productivity and scale. Scythe Robotics is headquartered in Longmont, Colorado. Find out more at https://scytherobotics.com.",
