            "text": "Mark Cuban may be entertained by chatbots like Microsoft-backed ChatGPT and Google's upcoming Bard \u2014 but he isn't ready to trust them.\n\nOnline misinformation \"is only going to get worse\" as artificial intelligence platforms evolve and spread, the billionaire tech entrepreneur and investor said on a recent episode of comedian Jon Stewart's podcast, \"The Problem with Jon Stewart.\"\n\nRight now, misinformation tends to spread through social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter \u2014 and that's with some semblance of human guardrails in place, Cuban said. But with ChatGPT and other similar platforms, the machines are in control.\n\n\"Once these things start taking on a life of their own ... it will be difficult for us to define why and how the machine makes the decisions it makes, and who controls the machine,\" Cuban said.\n\nHundreds of millions of users have tried ChatGPT to write poems, offer advice and recite recipes since the platform launched in November. But so far, the technology isn't showing itself to be smarter than the average human.\n\nPosting the chatbot's simplistic errors is a popular social media trend. At times, ChatGPT incorrectly answers math problems, refuses to answer basic riddles and even \"hallucinates\"\u2014 or completely makes up historical figures, events and other details that seem like facts.\n\nChatGPT can also contradict itself, sometimes providing different answers when repeatedly asked the same question.\n\nSimilarly, shares of Google's parent company Alphabet dropped more than 9% this week after Bard incorrectly answered a question about NASA's James Webb Space Telescope in one of Google's first ads for the AI platform.\n\nA raft of Google employees have blamed CEO Sundar Pichai for Bard's \"rushed, botched\" release, with the company feeling pressured to compete with ChatGPT, CNBC reported on Friday.\n\n\"Rushing Bard to market in a panic validated the market's fear about us,\" read one post on an internal Google forum reviewed by CNBC, alongside a photo of a face-palming bird.\n\nThe errors show that the technology is still in infantile stages. That's a problem, especially for large swaths of people who don't always fact check claims they see on the internet, Cuban said.\n\n\"Our generation, Gen X and older, doesn't get it,\" Cuban said. \"Gen Z and younger, they're not only native to it, they know how to block things out ... They're more in tune to all these issues.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, acknowledges that the technology behind ChatGPT isn't perfect \u2014 even as it plans to incorporate it into an upcoming version of its search engine, Bing.\n\n\"Bing will sometimes misrepresent the information it finds, and you may see responses that sound convincing but are incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate,\" the company's recently updated FAQ page says.\n\nIn the short term, that could be a problem \u2014 a concern Cuban shares with fellow tech billionaire Steve Wozniak. But other industry luminaries have expressed excitement about the technology's longer-term possibilities.\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates, for example, thinks platforms like ChatGPT represent a burgeoning technological revolution that'll make a \"huge impact\" on health care and education, he told German-language business newspaper Handelsblatt's \"Disrupt\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Today, they require too much computation, they're not always accurate ... But even this week, you'll have announcements from Microsoft and Google, where they're competing to lead in this space,\" Gates said. \"The progress over the next couple of years to make these things even better will be profound.\"\n\nGet CNBC's free Warren Buffett Guide to Investing, which distills the billionaire's No. 1 best piece of advice for regular investors, do's and don'ts, and three key investing principles into a clear and simple guidebook.\n\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter",

            "text": "An artist's impression of the Milky Way galaxy in its early days, surrounded by satellite galaxies that are falling into it.\n\nObservations of the tiny Sparkler dwarf galaxy have revealed it sits embedded in a system of ancient star clusters and is greedily feasting on its smaller galactic companions to grow.\n\nThis means the galaxy , which was discovered in the first data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), resembles the early cannibalistic Milky Way which also grew by feeding on smaller galaxies. Thus, the investigation of this galaxy provides astronomers with a unique insight into how the Milky Way has evolved.\n\nThe Sparkler , located in the southern constellation Volens, was given its name because it is surrounded by around two dozen shining globular clusters , tight groupings of ancient stars. Each of these clusters could contain around a million stars. Our galaxy currently hosts around 200 globular clusters of its own.\n\nRelated: 12 amazing James Webb Space Telescope discoveries across the universe\n\nThe team, led by Swinburne University professor Duncan Forbes, and San Jose State University professor Aaron Romanowsky, examined the age of Sparkler and its surroundings looking at the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Astronomers call these heavy elements \"metals.\"\n\nLooking at the galaxy's surrounding compact star clusters they realized they look like younger versions of the clusters around the Milky Way. Many are metal-rich, similar to globular clusters in the central bulge of our galaxy. The researchers also observed metal-poor intermediate-age clusters that are associated with a satellite galaxy that Sparkler is gobbling up, with its globular clusters acting as a desert.\n\nThe Sparkler galaxy is currently just 3% the mass of our galaxy, but the researchers expect it to grow via this feeding process over cosmic timescales to eventually match the mass of the Milky Way as we see it today.\n\n\"We appear to be witnessing, first hand, the assembly of this galaxy as it builds up its mass \u2014 in the form of a dwarf galaxy and several globular clusters,\" Forbes said in a statement (opens in new tab). \"We are excited by this unique opportunity to study both the formation of globular clusters and an infant Milky Way, at a time when the Universe was only 1/3 of its present age.\"\n\nLooking back in time with a little help from Einstein\n\nThe Sparkler galaxy is located 9 billion light-years from Earth meaning astronomers are seeing as it was around 4 billion years after the Big Bang . The observations are possible because of the impressive infrared observing power of the JWST and a phenomenon first predicted by Albert Einstein back in 1915.\n\nThe great physicist's theory of general relativity suggests that objects with great mass \"warp\" the fabric of space like a heavy ball placed on a stretched rubber sheet. Just as with that simple analogy, the greater the mass, the more extreme the curve it causes.\n\nThat means extremely massive objects like black holes or galaxies can \"dent\" space enough to warp light as it passes them. As a result, if light from a background object passes this warp its travel time is affected. This can lead to that background object being amplified by this foreground landing object, which is described as a \"gravitational lens.\"\n\nThe Sparkler galaxy is brightened by just such a gravitational lens which allows the JWST to spot its light which has been traveling for 9 billion years to reach the powerful space telescope.\n\nThe team will continue to study globular clusters around Sparkler to learn more about this distant, early galaxy, and in turn our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and its evolution.\n\n\"The origin of globular clusters is a long-standing mystery, and we are thrilled that JWST can look back in time to see them in their youth,\" Romanowsky said.\n\nThe team's research is published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (opens in new tab)",

Mobile phones, for instance, can be used to provide or receive information or to spread misinformation and cause nuisance,\u201d said Murthy Remilla, Head of Project Management, Gaganyaan, ISRO, Bengaluru.\n\nThere would be continuous development of technology in ISRO as in the case of mobile phones, which come with upgrades in cameras, increase in storage space and reduction in size and so on. As technology advances, the satellites would be equipped with high resolution cameras, which could take better quality pictures of even minute objects on the earth, from the sky. He spoke on the achievements of ISRO over the years and the future technologies like Chandrayaan-3.\n\nMr. Murthy described communication and remote sensing satellites as India\u2019s current space assets. They were being used for communication, navigation, earth observations, weather monitoring and space sciences. He spoke on the telemedicine via satellite, which was being used since 2001 to provide healthcare and medical services in remote rural areas, where the services of medical specialists was limited.\n\nHe also spoke about GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation) and its applications. He appealed to the students, teachers as also others to enrol as members of the Telemedicine Society of India, which has representatives from various fields to know about the services being offered by the society and reach out, in case of need. Interested persons could log on to www.tsi.org.in for details.\n\nAncient Indian scientists\n\nA professor from IIT-Chennai, V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, spoke on the discovery of stars, planets, comets and Supernova by scientists over the centuries through systematic methods and mathematical models. He mentioned about the contribution of ancient Indian scientists like Aryabhatta, Varaha Mihira and Brahma Gupta to space science. He also briefed about the contribution of scientists from ancient Egypt, China, Arabia and Polynesia to space science.\n\nA professor from NIT, Warangal, A. Ramachandrayya, spoke.\n\nPrincipal of Government Polytechnic N. Chandrasekhar presided.\n\nJVV State vice-president Trimurthulu Reddy and State committee members Gopala Rao, Radharani, K.M.M.R. Prasad, district president Subhakar and general secretary M. Srikanth were among those who attended.",

This annual award recognizes individuals or organizations that have demonstrated breakthrough space technology or program success representing milestones in space exploration.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to NASA\u2019s DART team and to our partners around the world who helped to make this mission a success,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \u201cDART was a watershed moment for planetary defense. NASA will continue to build on that legacy to be ready for whatever the universe throws at us!\u201d\n\nThe award will be presented at the Space Foundation\u2019s yearly opening ceremony of the Space Symposium in Colorado on April 17.\n\n\u201cAs a first-of-its-kind research mission for planetary defense, DART was another sterling example of the global teamwork and expertise required to make the unimaginable possible,\u201d said Space Foundation CEO Tom Zelibor. \u201cThis mission proves that there is no place humanity cannot touch when we work together for common purposes. The entirety of the DART team is to be commended for their extraordinary work in planetary defense and research.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s DART spacecraft launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California and successfully impacted its target asteroid, Dimorphos, on Sept. 26, 2022. While Dimorphos posed no hazard to Earth, DART\u2019s successful collision with the asteroid demonstrated one method of asteroid deflection using kinetic impactor technology.\n\nImmediately following DART\u2019s impact, the team began analyzing imagery returned by DART\u2019s onboard Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO) camera, the Italian Space Agency\u2019s Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube), which deployed from DART to capture images of the spacecraft\u2019s impact and resulting cloud of ejected matter from the asteroid. The team also is analyzing imagery from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, and Lucy spacecraft, which simultaneously captured observations of the DART impact on the surface of the small asteroid moonlet in the double-asteroid system Didymos.\n\nFollowing the collision with the asteroid, the team continued to obtain and analyze data from ground-based telescopes and radar facilities around the world to understand the efficiency of momentum transfer from DART\u2019s roughly 14,000-mile (22,530-kilometer) per hour collision with its target. These data, in tandem with the images returned by DRACO, LICIACube, Webb, Hubble, and Lucy are helping scientists understand the nature of the surface of Dimorphos, how much material was ejected by the collision, how fast it was ejected, as well as the distribution of particle sizes in the expanding dust cloud to ultimately determine how effectively a kinetic impactor spacecraft can modify an asteroid\u2019s orbit.\n\n\u201cThe international collaboration of NASA\u2019s DART mission with ASI\u2019s LICIACube, along with data collected by observers around the world of the impact results shows the global nature of protecting our planet from hazardous near-Earth objects,\u201d said Sandra Connelly, acting associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. \u201cWorking together, our planetary defense efforts can both advance our ability to respond to an asteroid on a collision course with Earth should one ever be discovered, as well as unite us behind the common goal of protecting our planet and its inhabitants.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations to the DART team on this well-deserved recognition,\u201d said Bobby Braun, head of the Space Exploration Sector at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). \u201cThese talented scientists and engineers should be proud of their critical contributions in developing and operating humanity\u2019s first planetary defense test mission.\u201d\n\nRecent winners of the Space Achievement Award include the International Astronautical Federation, U.S. Space Force, and International Space Station Partners. The Space Foundation also recognized NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope team with a top award.\n\nJohns Hopkins APL built and operated the DART spacecraft and manages the DART mission for NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Coordination Office as a project of the agency\u2019s Planetary Missions Program Office. Since DART\u2019s impact with its target asteroid, telescopic and radar facilities contributed observations used by the DART team to confirm by how much DART altered Dimorphos\u2019 speed and path.",

            "text": "I\u2019m one of the few people I know who was born in Fort Collins. True, I still run into old classmates at the local grocery, but the vast majority of my friends are transplants. I don\u2019t blame them \u2014 what good taste they have! \u2014 but this place is particularly special because it holds all my memories, including those of 5-year-old Laura, trudging up the iconic \u201cA\u201d mountain to the west of town and looking down at the stadium and sprawling meadow below.\n\nHughes Stadium \u2014 former home to Colorado State\u2019s football games and some good concerts \u2014 is now gone, and CSU\u2019s stadium has since been built closer to campus. But the open space on which Hughes used to sit remains, and its future is uncertain. Nestled just below the first rise of foothills just west of Fort Collins, this space spreads out below the huge white \u201cA\u201d (which forever confuses visitors, but which stands for \u201cAggies\u201d).\n\nThe CSU Board of Governors approved sale of the land to the City of Fort Collins a few years ago, and now the city has begun outreach efforts to determine its use. The city staff and/or hired consultant is scheduled to present focus group results to the city council at its March 14 work session, meaning that now is the time to send the city council comments.\n\nI\u2019ve done just that, and my comment is this: This is incredibly special and fragile land. The only way to keep it that way is to protect it. Protect it for current inhabitants, for the nonhuman creatures that call it home, for the future people who move here, and to honor the Indigenous peoples who had it stolen from them.\n\nThe meadow should be restored, the viewshed should be protected. We should stop the sprawl when and where we can, particularly in such a unique ecotone. Moreover, it should be saved for light recreational use, such as the sledding hill, the disc golf course, and the hiking nearby \u2014 and not the large-scale bike park advocated by some.\n\nI can literally think of no other available open space more deserving of protection. That is why I support the efforts of those trying to protect Hughes in perpetuity, and who are advocating that the area be turned into a City Natural Area. Development there would be a tragedy \u2014 but so, too, would be a huge bike park, as proposed by Overland Mountain Bike Association.\n\nThe group advocating protection \u2014 PATHS \u2014 is not alone. Indeed, keeping this land as open space is exactly what Fort Collins residents say they want. In a citizen-driven ballot measure in 2021, nearly 70% of residents voted in favor of protecting this as open space.\n\nSituated right below Horsetooth Reservoir, this area is home to wildlife that (lest we forget) don\u2019t just like it, but depend upon it. Wildlife numbers are decreasing at an astonishing rate, and that\u2019s primarily due to loss of habitat. Herons, deer, coyotes \u2014 they need this place too. Keeping land from being developed is one of the most obvious and just things we can do.\n\nBut humans like the area too \u2014 indeed, this land is adjacent to two of the most-used hiking trails in all of Fort Collins. It\u2019s a rare and wonderful thing to have a parcel of land become available so near such excellent and well-loved trails, which indeed are in danger of being loved to death (just try to find a parking spot on weekends!). Now is the time to honor that unique opportunity \u2014 by preserving it.\n\nOnce it\u2019s gone and developed, it\u2019s gone and developed. This is a one-chance deal.\n\nAs a child, I roamed what used to be pastures just south of Prospect, east of this area. Bugs and birds and mud and flowers \u2014 that was the stuff of my childhood. Sadly, no kiddo growing up in that neighborhood now has access to what I did. But we can protect what little is left.\n\nThose who live here know: This is a damn great place to live (not that anyone else should move here, ha!). The City of Fort Collins should be commended for all it has done; we have amazing trails and spaces and parks. But we have lost a good deal, too \u2014 just ask my memory bank. Let\u2019s protect what we can, while we can.",

            "text": "MOSCOW -\n\nAn uncrewed Russian supply ship docked at the International Space Station has leaked coolant, the Russian space corporation and NASA reported Saturday, saying the incident doesn't pose any danger to the station's crew.\n\nRoscosmos said the hatch between the station and the Progress MS-21 had been locked so the incident didn't affect the orbiting outpost.\n\n\"The temperature and pressure on board the station are within norms and there is no danger to health and safety of the crew,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe initial statement from Roscosmos left it unclear whether the entire cargo ship or just some of its systems lost pressure, but Sergei Krikalev, head of Roscosmos' crewed programs, later clarified that there was depressurization of the craft's coolant loop.\n\nNASA said its specialists are assisting their Russian counterparts in the troubleshooting of the coolant leak.\n\n\"Officials are monitoring all International Space Station systems and are not tracking any other issues,\" NASA said. \"The crew, which was informed of the cooling loop leak, is in no danger and continuing with normal space station operations.\"\n\nThe depressurization of the cargo craft's coolant loop follows a similar incident in December with the Soyuz crew capsule, which Russian space officials said had been caused by a tiny meteoroid that left a small hole in the exterior radiator and sent coolant spewing into space.\n\nRoscosmos has launched a probe into a possible cause of the cooling loop leak, and Krikalev said that experts will closely look at materials and technologies used in spacecraft manufacturing as part of the probe.\n\n\"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that it wouldn't affect similar components that will be used in the future,\" Krikalev said. \"This is the most important task.\"\n\nRoscosmos noted that before the leak the cargo ship had already been loaded with waste prior to its scheduled disposal. The craft is set to be undocked from the station and deorbit to burn in the atmosphere on Feb. 18.\n\nThe announcement came shortly after a new Russian cargo ship docked smoothly at the station on Saturday. The Progress MS-22 delivered almost three tons of food, water and fuel along with scientific equipment for the crew.\n\nRoscosmos said that the incident didn't affect the docking of the new cargo ship and \"will have no impact on the future station program.\"\n\nRussian Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to use the Soyuz crew capsule to return to Earth in March, but Russian space officials decided that higher temperatures resulting from the coolant leak could make it dangerous to use.\n\nThey decided to launch a new Soyuz capsule on Feb. 20 so the crew have a lifeboat in the event of an emergency. But since it will travel in automatic mode to expedite the launch, a replacement crew will now have to wait until late summer or fall when another capsule is ready. It means that Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio will have to stay several extra months at the station, possibly pushing their mission to close to a year.\n\nNASA took part in all the discussions and agreed with the plan.\n\nBesides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada; Russian Anna Kikina; and Japan's Koichi Wakata. The four rode up on a SpaceX capsule last October.",

            "text": "Earth & Beyond Ventures (EBV), a new early-stage venture fund backed by global technology, manufacturing, and space industry conglomerates, has launched with commitments of $125 million to leverage Israel\u2019s expertise in DeepTech, aerospace, and satellite engineering in a bid to boost Israel\u2019s emerging commercial space ecosystem. It is the first fund of its kind in Israel to focus specifically on supporting deep technology innovations with dual purpose space and terrestrial applications.\n\nCorning Inc., a global materials and manufacturing giant and a 50-year supplier of materials and products to NASA, is one of a prestigious group of corporations backing the new fund, which also includes Japanese electronics giant Kyocera Corp; global manufacturer of electronic connectivity components Samtec; and Spacecom, the Israeli satellite communication services and solutions provider.\n\nThe fund\u2019s general partners include Daniel Recanati (founder of Rhodium), Doron Zauer, Dr. Israel Biran, and Ofer Asif (on behalf of Spacecom). The group is also backed by the Israel Innovation Authority.\n\nThe fund\u2019s launch comes at a time of rapid growth in the \"New Space\" industry, also known as the commercial or private space industry, which is dominated by the private sector and entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, unlike the traditional space industry, which has been primarily government-funded and focused on space exploration, communication, and defense.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2021, total annual investment in the commercial space sector grew from $300 million to more than $10 billion, according to McKinsey. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have both estimated Space 2.0 could generate over $1 trillion in revenue by 2040.\n\nGrowth in the sector is being driven by a combination of factors, including advances in technology, a growing demand for space-based services, and a shift towards a more market-driven approach to space activities. Another factor is NASA\u2019s renewed moon missions, which it sees as a starting point toward more ambitious targets, like getting humans to Mars. China, India, and the European Space Agency also have strong space programs, while other spacefaring nations such as the UK, France, Italy, Japan, and South Korea maintain ambitious plans for space.\n\nNew Space\u2019s immediate market is focused on getting assets into space that can provide services to Earth, including things like enhanced earth observation, space-based data storage and processing, improved materials for lighter satellites, in-space manufacturing, and drug discovery in microgravity.\n\nWith a renewed global interest in space exploration and commercialization, technologies that Israelis develop in everything from semiconductors, robotics, new materials, sensors, smart farms, quantum computing, solar power, cyber security, and alternative proteins, could become crucial for enabling the use of and access to space in the near and long term, including eventual Moon and Mars colonization. In the short term the same technologies will address huge markets on earth and will provide solutions for the most pressing problems in climate, energy, materials, computing and more. It is in these commercially focused dual earth and space technologies that Earth & Beyond Ventures will be investing, with check sizes of between $0.5 million to $2 million for Seed and Pre-Seed companies.\n\n\u201cIsrael's achievements in the development of innovative technologies are world-renowned, but many don\u2019t realize that Israel was one of the first countries to design, build and launch its own satellite, a feat which requires tremendous cross-disciplinary expertise and know-how. Together with our investors and partners in the ecosystem, our job at Earth & Beyond Ventures is to identify and support the deep technologies and ideas that can become powerful applications not just here on earth, but in space as well,\" said Earth & Beyond Ventures CEO Baruch Schori.\n\nKyocera\u2019s investment in the fund is particularly noteworthy as the multibillion-dollar company, one of the world\u2019s leading electronic component and ceramic manufacturers with applications across automotive, mobile devices, advanced sensors, solar panels, and more, is also a strategic supplier to the space industry, with components in telescopes, space probes, and satellites.\n\n\"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to partner with Earth & Beyond Ventures to explore new business opportunities together in the Israeli space tech market, which we consider having high future growth potential. Kyocera Group has contributed to spacetech through a wide range of products, and I am looking forward to seeing many more contributions coming from this strategic investment in Israel and in Earth & Beyond Ventures,\" said Koichi Kano, Director & Managing Executive Officer, Kyocera Corporation.\n\nEarth & Beyond\u2019s advisory board is packed with aerospace and tech luminaries, including former Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) CEO Yossi Weiss, The Technion --Israel Institute of Technology\u2019s Space Research Institute head Prof. Ehud Bachar, and former Science Minister Yizhar Shay. In addition to its investment activities, Earth & Beyond Ventures is working together with international and local strategic partners to build up the Israeli space-technology ecosystem, supporting it through its broad mentor and professional adviser network.",

            "text": "Like many spacewalk missions, extended pump sets and foot limiters featured in their first spacewalk. They may sound familiar. But what are they and how do they function?\n\nChina's Shenzhou-15 crew, currently onboard the country's space station, recently completed its first spacewalk.\n\nExtended pump sets: 'Heart' of thermal control system\n\nChina's space station has a thermal control system, which is like a central air conditioner.\n\nIt can adjust the temperature so as to provide a suitable environment for astronauts and equipment.\n\nThe extended pump is needed to circulate the liquid in the system.\n\nAll three modules of the space station are equipped with extended pump sets, which function like the heart of the human body, Su Nan, chief designer of overall machinery for the space station spacewalk mission with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, told China Media Group.\n\nThe heat of equipment in the space station is absorbed by a large metal plate that is leaned against the equipment. By circulating the liquid through the extended pump sets, the temperature can be decreased, Su explained.\n\nThe extended pump sets are installed outside a capsule. They can be plug-and-play and replaced if they malfunction in the future, he added.\n\nFoot limiters: Fixing astronauts at working position\n\nAstronauts are in a weightless state after leaving the cabin, and if they want to work at a designated location, their position needs to be fixed. The solution is foot limiters, which are commonly used auxiliary devices when astronauts conduct extravehicular activities.\n\n\"The foot limiter has a fixed position on the cabin body, when astronauts need to work at a certain point on the bulkhead, there must be a foot limiter,\" Su said.\n\nThe space station has four foot limiters, which are stored in the hatches of the airlock compartment and the node compartment, Su said.\n\nWhen astronauts leave the cabin, they will determine the installation position of the foot limiter according to their mission needs, he added.\n\nRead more:\n\nSpace Log: How is the 1st spacewalk of China's Shenzhou-15 crew?",
