            "text": "A schoolgirl, inspired by her asthmatic mother, has won a national innovation competition by designing a backpack that filters air to protect people from airborne hazards.\n\nEleanor Woods, from High Burton, Huddersfield, entered the Backpack To The Future competition after her mother, who suffers from asthma, put the application form in her room where she drew up her winning design.\n\n\u201cI have an air filter at home because my mum has mild asthma,\u201d Eleanor told the PA news agency.\n\nPowered by green energy from solar power and a dynamo, a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, the backpack\u2019s built-in filter and fans clean polluted air nearby.\n\n\u201cMy Breathe Better Backpack is all about keeping my friends, family and classmates safe using an air filter.\n\n\u201cIt looks cool, will help get kids outside and fights off colds,\u201d she said while holding her original design.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that came to mind when it came to the design is that blue is one of my favourite colours and blue feels clean and the bubbles on the outside have a clean theme for breathing.\u201d\n\nGetting much closer to her mum during lockdown and the ongoing pandemic gave the 12-year-old food for thought.\n\n\u201cWe have just had a pandemic and this backpack could help prevent another one from happening with the air filters,\u201d Eleanor said.\n\n\u201cMy generation is really aware of pollution and we have lessons on it at school along with diseases spreading, and this is another reason I designed this, because it is getting much worse.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the young designer is acutely aware of pollution, as she lives on a main road.\n\n\u201cI walk to school, next to the road, and can taste the petrol when buses come through,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, she hopes the impact of her backpack will be far-reaching, saying: \u201cIf just a few people start using it, it could be really good for the planet.\n\n\u201cGreta Thunberg is a really big role model for me.\u201d\n\nThe Backpack To the Future competition is a partnership between the Institution of Engineering and Technology and fashion brand Hype, aiming to challenge children to invent a backpack that helps them do incredible things.\n\nIt was launched to change perceptions, encourage more diversity within engineering and to show children how they could combine an interest in fashion with a career in science, technology, engineering or maths.\n\nIn the future, Eleanor hopes to enter the world of creative design, while she is also eager to get into teaching.\n\nWhen they found out she had won, Eleanor\u2019s mother, Annabel Hobbs, 58, said she was \u201csquealing\u201d adding \u201cI can\u2019t believe she drew something and now we actually get to see it.\u201d\n\nEleanor was presented with her winning design in London this weekend and has had to keep her news a secret.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most excited to tell my grandparents, I think they will be really excited and would love to see it,\u201d Eleanor said.",
