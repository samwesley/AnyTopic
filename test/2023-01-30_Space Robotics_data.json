            "text": "A festive galactic spectacle shines bright in red as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured a star-glittered backdrop that looks like the space is celebrating its own Christmas.\n\nThe stunning images feature a small portion of the nebula Weserhout 5, or also known as the Soul Nebula. This interstellar wonder hails 7000 light-years away from our planet Earth.\n\n(Photo : ESA/Hubble & NASA, R. Sahai)\n\nFree-Floating Bubbles\n\nBright orange-red clouds with varied densities cover the image's backdrop. Several huge, pale blue stars with distinct cross-shaped spikes are also strewn in the top-left corner of the picture.\n\nESA wrote in its news release that one of these stars is surrounded by a tiny, black patch that resembles a tadpole. The lower right of the image is filled with thick, dark vapor that looks like black smoke. In front of it, a little blue star and a brilliant yellow star are visible as well.\n\nSeveral intriguing elements can be found in this glowing image, including a free-floating Evaporating Gaseous Globule (frEGG). The tiny, black area in the upper center-left of the picture that resembles a tadpole is the frEGG.\n\nTwo names are attached to this buoyant-appearing bubble: [KAG2008] globule 13 and J025838.6+604259.\n\nA specific type of evaporating gaseous globule is called a FrEGG (EGGs). The patches of gas known as frEGGs and EGGs are sufficiently dense compared to the less compact gas encircling them to enable their slow photoevaporation, according to ESA.\n\nRead Also: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope Snaps a Brilliant Pair of Stars Sparkling Amid the Mystical Orion Nebula\n\nPhotoevaporation\n\nPhotoevaporation takes place when a young, brilliant star releases a considerable amount of UV light, ionizing the gas and scattering it away.\n\nEGGs were only recently discovered, most notably near the tips of the Pillars of Creation, which Hubble photographed and immortalized in famous photographs published in 1995 and was recently captured by the newly-minted James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nFrEGGs, which were only recently discovered as well, differ from EGGs since they are detachable and have a head-tail form.\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the density of FrEGGs and EGGs makes it hard for strong ultraviolet radiation to pass through them. Hence, astronomers are keen on studying these galactic objects.\n\nAdditionally, ESA said that they are relatively opaque, shielding the gas inside from ionization and photoevaporation. It is believed that numerous FrEGGs and EGGs serve as the birthplace of new stars because they are also thought to be crucial in the production of protostars.\n\nIn this picture, the frEGG is the dark speck within the background of red light. The image has a distinctive red color due to H-alpha emission, which is a specific type of light emission. This happens when an extremely energetic electron inside a hydrogen atom loses a specific amount of energy, leading to the electron becoming less energetic and releasing a red light.\n\nRelated Article: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope Captures 'Butterfly Nebula' In Stunning Motion | Fun Facts About This Beautiful Space Butterfly\n\n\u24d2 2022 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Brown, Pilot William C. McCool, Payload Commander Michael P. Anderson, Mission Specialist 2 Kalpana Chawla, Commander Rick D. Husband, Mission Specialist 4 Laurel Blair Salton Clark, and Payload Specialist 1 Ilan Ramon.\n\nThe crew was less than 20 minutes from landing on February 1, 2003, when mission control lost contact with the shuttle, according to NASA's website. According to the website, a piece of foam opened a hole in one of the shuttle's wings which led to the breakup of the orbiter and resulted in the loss of the vehicle and the crew.\n\nNASA recently held a Day of Remembrance ceremony to honor those killed on board the Columbia shuttle and the crew of the Challenger and Apollo One.\n\nMORE | See full 20th anniversary event schedule here\n\nTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Shuttle Columbia tragedy, the Patricia Huffman Smith Nasa Museum in Hemphill is hosting events and offering free admission from January 30, 2023, to February 1, 2023. Many remains from the Space Shuttle Columbia landed around Hemphill.\n\nThe events are organized by the museum and the NASA Alumni League, Johnson Space Center Chapter. The theme is \u201cSTS-107: Still Our Mission 20 Years later,\u201d according to a museum release.\n\nOrganizers hope the events will inform Texans about the 2003 tragedy and subsequent recovery efforts.\n\nEvents on the schedule include an art show, NASA exhibitions, panel discussions, a solemn memorial service, reunions, a student robotics competition, guided museum tours, and guest speakers.\n\nBeginning Monday, the museum will offer three days of free admission to its 3,400-square-foot main gallery.

It\u2019s a massively dangerous event that can affect people all around the world and can take decades or more to contain or clean up even then leading to areas becoming uninhabitable for millennia.\n\nThe most recent major nuclear disaster happened at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011 and saw several reactors melt their fuel, some of which then went on to have a hydrogen explosion. Since the meltdown occurred, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has been working to document and clean the huge radioactive mess there, but, unlike that scene from HBO\u2019s Chernobyl, it\u2019s not using people to do this deadly work. It\u2019s using robots.\n\nThis video from the YouTube channel Asianometry not only goes into the many different types of robots used at Fukushima, some of American and most of Japanese design, but it also goes into a brief history of the use of robots in nuclear disasters going back to the Three Mile Island accident which happened in Pennsylvania in 1979.\n\nRobotics is cool (other than those terrifying Boston Dynamics robots), and this is a case where they\u2019re not just doing important work with bleeding-edge technology; they\u2019re actively saving lives.",

            "text": "Richard Williamson, MD, FAANS\n\nThe use of robotics in surgical practice has been a field of rapid development during the last few decades. The first use of a robot for neurosurgery was in 1985 when an industrial robot was used to guide biopsy cannulas under computer tomography guidance, improving accuracy and reducing procedure time relative to a manually adjustable frame. Although neurosurgery is among the last surgical fields to incorporate this novel technology, its potential utility cannot be understated.\n\nSince robotics were first introduced, there has been continual improvement in electronics miniaturization, medical imaging, image analysis, control theory, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interfaces. There are several institutions have adopted these advancements, including Allegheny Health Network (AHN). AHN became the first hospital in the state of Pennsylvania to use the Synaptive Modus V, a digital surgical microscope with a robotic arm derived from previous models used on the International Space Station.\n\nRecently, NeurologyLive\u00ae sat down with Richard Williamson, MD, FAANS, a neurosurgeon at AHN, to discuss the advances in robotics, and specifically, the use of robotic exoscopes. An exoscope is a high-definition digital imaging system that enables surgeons to see a magnified, 3-dimensional image of the surgical field during microsurgeries. Williamson, who believes robotics will be integral to the growth of neurosurgery, provided perspective on the capabilities of these technologies and how they ease the operation.\n\nCan you detail the use of robotic exoscopes used in neurosurgery?\n\nAn exoscope is essentially a high-fidelity camera with a light source that is attached to a robotic arm. That arm can be positioned throughout a surgical field in order to provide magnification illumination. As opposed to traditional microscope, which has essentially an eyepiece that you put your eyes into it, you put your head on it, and you look in through the lens. This is indirect visualization, because you have a camera that's essentially recording information, and then it projects it to a screen in the room, and then we're looking at that screen. It's in real time. Essentially, we're operating with our hands in a surgical field, but looking at a screen just a couple feet away.\n\nHow would you assess the functionality of this exoscope? Can any neurosurgeon feel comfortable picking it up?\n\nPretty much any neurosurgeon can pick this up and start to use it right away. As part of our training, we have other similar instruments, one of which we call an endoscope. This is basically a light camera source, but we typically put it inside the patient either through a nasal cavity or some other kind of use. We already have that workflow and some of those haptics in our mind where we can essentially do things with our hands but the look at a screen away from the surgical field.\n\nThat being said, there are some nuances to how do we position the excess scope. So that it doesn't get contaminated, so that we can operate around it. How can we optimize some of the visual settings on the exoscope to maximize the light in the surgical area? There are different filters that we can apply, depending on the tissue that we're operating on. And so, using some of that information, it takes time, and it takes experience to gain that.\n\nIs there any additional game planning with these new technologies?\n\nFor every single surgical procedure, we come up with a game plan. What are the goals of this procedure? What is the important anatomy that we're going to be operating in or near? What are the potential pitfalls? How are we going to set up the technology in the room? Where are we going to position the exoscope? How are we going to position the patient? Where are we going to plan our incision? Do we have all the things that we need? There's so much that goes into just the kind of the setup and the planning for a surgical procedure. And without that, it the surgery won't be as successful.\n\nWhat are ways can we expand the capabilities and uses of robotic exoscopes?\n\nCurrently, it's being used for all neurosurgical procedures where we need both magnification illumination. Obviously, that's really the breadth of all of neurosurgery. But where we can expand the use of this technology is in other areas: integrating augmented reality into the exoskope so that we\u2019re not only seeing a projection of what the camera is seeing, but maybe it's showing us what we can't necessarily see with our naked eyes. Maybe we can apply a filter and it can stain for a certain kind of tumor, for removing a brain tumor, or it can highlight the the blood vessels of the brain so that we know exactly where important structures are, thus ultimately making our surgeries more precise and safer.\n\nWhat type of role will robotics play in neurosurgery in the coming years?\n\nThe goal of all neurosurgery is to be precise. We want to be accurate, and we want to be safe. Those are the main tenants of all neurosurgeries. Robotics can help us with all those [aspects] by making everything more precise. We can integrate some of the imaging that we do, the MRI scans and CT scans, into essentially a robot, which is tracking that information. There's even ways that we can have robotics do portions of a procedure, some of the automated portions. We can use a CT scan of someone's brain and the outline of their skull, and with some precision, we can have a robot remove or drill away a very small piece of the skull to gain us surgical access. That technology, as it stands now, it\u2019s not there yet. But those are things I think are probably coming within the next 5 or 10 years, and we will be able to start using some of that technology in the operating room.\n\nThe only other thing that I would mention is the stuff that we don't really tend to think about. Because the exoscope untethers you from your laser light source and your magnification, there actually is this whole piece of what we call surgical ergonomics. This is where I can position the lights to go in very extreme angles. Traditionally, I would have to move my head and my body to achieve that same angle in surgery. And now, I can perform surgeries for longer with less comfort. Not that it\u2019s the most important thing, but it is important, because some of these procedures can take hours. If the surgeon can operate more comfortably for an extended period of time, then ultimately I think the patients will benefit.\n\nTranscript edited for clarity.",

            "summary": "\nRobotics have been rapidly developed and adopted into neurosurgery in the last few decades, with Allegheny Health Network (AHN) being the first hospital in Pennsylvania to use the Synaptive Modus V. Richard Williamson, MD, FAANS spoke to NeurologyLive\u00ae about robotic exoscopes which are high-definition digital imaging systems used for microsurgeries that provide surgeons a magnified 3D image of the surgical field. Exoscopes can be easily picked up by any neurosurgeon and offer improved ergonomics during long surgeries as well as potential augmented reality capabilities for increased precision. Robotics will continue to play an integral role in neurosurgical growth over the next 5-10 years."

This interstellar wonder is located 7000 light-years away and features bright orange-red clouds with varied densities, huge pale blue stars, dark vapor resembling black smoke, and a free-floating Evaporating Gaseous Globule (frEGG) which is believed to be crucial in the production of protostars and serves as a birthplace for new stars. \n2. Science fiction movies provide entertainment, stimulate creativity and imagination, explore societal issues that are important today, spark interest in science and help viewers better understand scientific concepts. Show your appreciation for these films by treating yourself to some sci-fi swag from TeePublic! \n3. Robotics technology has been used for decades in nuclear disasters such as at Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan where Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) is utilizing various robot designs both American and Japanese to document and clean up radioactive mess safely with minimal human exposure - helping us better understand how these accidents occur so they can be prevented in the future. \n4.
