He began his longstanding coaching career in the college ranks at Dayton in 1982 as a volunteer assistant, earned a graduate assistant spot at North Carolina State in 1983 then took a full-time position as Bowling Green's defensive backs coach later that year.\n\nAfter a year at San Diego State (1987-88) as the defensive backs/special teams coach, Hoke coached defensive backs at Kent State from 1989-93, and earned the defensive coordinator title in his final season. He then spent five seasons (1994-98) as Missouri's defensive backs coach then served as Florida's defensive coordinator/secondary coach from 1999-2001. Hoke's most recent college coaching stops include South Carolina (2015) and Maryland (2019-21).\n\nAs a player, Hoke was a four-year letterman at Ball State and earned all-MAC honors as a defensive back. He also had a brief stint in the NFL, playing 11 games for the Bears in 1980.\n\nCable possesses five years of coaching experience, including four seasons in the NFL as an offensive/defensive assistant for the Raiders (2018-21). Most recently, Cable worked as the outside linebackers coach at the University of Northern Colorado during the 2022 season. He played defensive line at the University of Idaho, where he was a three-year starter and two-time captain.\n\nThe Bears promoted Young to assistant quarterbacks and wide receivers coach after spending his first season with the organization as an offensive quality control coach in 2022. Young now has 14 years of coaching experience, including four in the NFL. He spent two years with the Packers from 2017-18 as an offensive quality control coach, where he worked with Bears offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, who was Green Bay's wide receivers coach in 2017.\n\nThe strength & conditioning staff's hires include two familiar faces, as Harris served as the club's strength and conditioning seasonal assistant in 2022 while Ngo spent the 2015-20 seasons with the Bears. Harris originally worked for the Bears as the director of player development for seven seasons starting in 2007 before joining the Buccaneers in 2014. Harris also held multiple roles on the player development and operations side for the Vikings prior to his first stint in Chicago.\n\nNgo returns to Chicago after serving as the Broncos' assistant strength and conditioning coach for the 2021 and 2022 seasons.

            "text": "The Chicago Bears are believers in the upside of quarterback Justin Fields and that is why there is a very strong chance the organization looks to instead move their top pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nThis past season, the Chicago Bears finished with their worst record since going 1-13 in 1969. On their path to eventually finishing 3-14, the team traded away key players and seemed to punt on 2022-2023 weeks before it ever came to a close. Yet, despite how abysmal the team was, there is a reason for hope.\n\nIn the NFL, if you don\u2019t have a worthwhile quarterback, your chance of success is very limited. However, in this season 2021 first-round pick Justin Fields took some nice development steps forward. Before suffering an injury at the tail end of the season, Fields and the offense were a formidable group that broke several Bears rushing records.\n\nRelated: 2023 NFL Draft order \u2013 Updated picks by team before Super Bowl LVII\n\nFurthermore, while the young QB displayed his running talents all season, he also showed notable growth as a passer. And that is why the team is not looking to make a change despite a rich class of QBs in this year\u2019s draft, and owning the top overall pick.\n\nChicago Bears could trade No. 1 pick in the 2023 NFL draft\n\nCredit: Daniel Bartel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDuring a Tuesday appearance on \u201cThe Rich Eisen Show,\u201d NFL insider Albert Breer spoke about the belief the Chicago Bears have in Justin Fields and how the way he handled himself as the quarterback and locker room leader during a rough season proved a lot to the organization.\n\n\u201cThat scored him a lot of points with people in that organization, and I think right now, where things are trending towards Justin Fields being their quarterback in 2023 \u2026 They\u2019re either gonna try and get somebody to trade for that pick or take Jalen Carter or Will Anderson.\u201d \u2013 Albert Breer on Bears likely draft plans\n\n3 possible potential trade partners for Chicago Bears pick in NFL Draft\n\nStaying pat to take edge rusher Will Anderson or talented defensive tackle Jalen Carter \u2014 two players viewed among the very best in this draft \u2014 certainly wouldn\u2019t be a bad decision. However, with this draft deep in strong QB prospects, and many teams in desperate need of a long-term answer, the Bears have a high-value asset.\n\nIf the Chicago Bears were willing to move down, three teams that would likely give them a pretty strong offer would be the Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, and Carolina Panthers. All three organizations are in transition and will have new head coaches in 2023. They will also need new starting QBs and are desperate for a franchise signal-caller.\n\nThere is a very real chance the Chicago Bears could parlay their No. 1 pick into getting a first-round pick a few slots back, as well as extra picks in the second and third rounds. All spots where they can find players that could make an immediate impact next season.",

And this was because of massive speculation surrounding what the hell was going to happen with quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nAs time went along and clarity started to form, it began to appear as if the Chicago Bears were going to stick with Fields rather than draft a new quarterback with the top pick, and with each passing day, more and more people hopped on board with that mindset.\n\nSports Illustrated senior NFL reporter Albert Breer has now joined the fold:\n\n\u201cMy sense is that they\u2019re going to move forward with Justin Fields and try to trade the first pick,\u201d Breer said in a Jan. 31 interview with Rich Eisen. \u201cCould that change based on their evaluation of Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud, Will Levis, Anthony Richardson? Sure. But I\u2019ve talked to enough people there that feel like Justin didn\u2019t \u2014 there wasn\u2019t enough around Justin to get a really clean evaluation on him last year, and given what he had, what he did was really, really impressive.\u201d\n\nI see what the Chicago Bears are trying to do here. They\u2019re trusting Justin Fields to be their franchise quarterback and are using their No. 1 pick to get some value at another position. For them, it\u2019s a gamble \u2014 a gamble worth a shot \u2014 but still a gamble. I\u2019m not saying it won\u2019t work, it could very well go their way, but I won\u2019t lie, I have my doubts. I\u2019m just not big into Justin Fields.\n\nBut I give the Bears this: Out of their other quarterback options with the draft, they have types like Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud, Will Levis and Anthony Richardson. As you see, nobody is standing out on that list like, for example, Joe Burrow when he was coming into the 2020 NFL Draft out of LSU, so I don\u2019t necessarily blame Chicago for their strategy. There really aren\u2019t any sexy picks out of the quarterback category this year, so I get it.

            "text": "As Bears general manager Ryan Poles surveys potential trade partners for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, a few names have potentially joined the fray.\n\nThe Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts remain the most likely trade targets for the Bears. Colts general manager Chris Ballard's end-of-season comments had to have Poles excited about the possible price he could extract.\n\nTom Brady's retirement announcement Wednesday could potentially bring the Las Vegas Raiders, who own the No. 7 pick, and the New York Jets, who own the No. 13 pick, into the equation.\n\nBut another team is lurking as a potential sleeper: The Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe Panthers have a solid young core and play in an NFC South division that just got weaker with Brady's retirement. Some believe the Panthers could be a potential landing spot for Derek Carr or Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nHowever, recently-hired head coach Frank Reich just came from Indianapolis, where relying on veteran retread quarterbacks cost him his job. He knows the importance of finding a long-term fit and not patching over that hole year after year.\n\nGeneral manager Scott Fitterer clarified that the Panthers would prefer to \"draft and develop\" a quarterback. If that means trading up, so be it.\n\n\"I think you've got to have conviction,\" Fitterer said via Schuyler Callihan. If there's a guy in this class that you like, you got to go up and go get him. We're in a position now where we have a defense, we have an offensive line. We built around this for this opportunity. So if you have conviction, go get him. If not, you don't want to force it. You don't want to take a player and pass on a really good player, that might set you back. But you can't be afraid to take a shot if you believe that's the guy.\n\n\"I don't think you ever want to box yourself in and just say hey, we'll go strictly draft. I've always said that's kind of the proper way to do it. Draft and develop from a cost effective standpoint. But if we don't believe that guy is there this year, and we haven't even started the process, our scouts have. In an ideal world we would draft and develop.\"\n\nThe Panthers own the No. 9 overall pick in the first round. Eight spots might be too big of a move down for the Bears. That would likely cost them the ability to add a true blue-chip talent in Will Anderson or Jalen Carter. But if the Panthers are willing to overpay for the right to move up to No. 1, the Bears will have to consider it.\n\nThe ideal scenario being bandied about for the Bears is a trade-down with the Colts. By moving down to four, the Bears would, in theory, still get one of either Carter or Anderson while also adding a future draft capital from Indianapolis.\n\nThe best thing for the Bears is to have as many bidders as possible as the draft nears.\n\nBrady might have helped that cause Wednesday by removing the top veteran option from the offseason quarterback carousel.\n\nCarolina is in an excellent position to overtake the NFC South throne from the Brady-less Bucs. But the Panthers will need a quarterback to make that happen.\n\nDesperation often leads to foolish mistakes or overpays, something the Bears hope to take advantage of come draft time.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

That\u2019s the biggest unknown involving not just the Chicago Bears but the entire NFL this draft cycle.\n\nWhile the Bears have nearly three months to figure it out, Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated said on the Rich Eisen Show Wednesday that his sense is the Bears will stick with Fields and trade the No. 1 pick \u2014 setting up a potential blockbuster deal that should fetch them one of the biggest hauls in NFL history.\n\nLuke Getsy, the Bears\u2019 offensive coordinator and American Team coach at this week\u2019s Senior Bowl, didn\u2019t come out and say that Fields is the Bears\u2019 guy in 2023 (and presumably beyond) when he met with reporters Wednesday. But he certainly made a compelling argument that Fields still has another leap (or two) in him after a much improved Year 2.\n\nLuke Getsy on Justin Fields\n\n\u201cI have great confidence in Justin,\u201d Getsy told reporters. \u201cWe saw the growth that he had a year ago to where he\u2019s at now. He still has a long way to go as far as where we want him to be and he knows that. Nobody works harder than Justin. The kind of guy he is and the kind of leader he is, I am really excited to see what he is doing this coming season.\u201d\n\nWhen asked where the Bears saw the most growth in Fields \u2014 who had 1,143 yards and eight touchdowns rushing to go with his 2,242 and 17 passing \u2014 Getsy replied:\n\n\u201cProbably the leadership part of it. He came out of his shell and really took command of the team. His confidence grew and all that stuff that\u2019s really important in taking a team where you want to go. Guy put the team on his back for a few weeks there and showed that he\u2019s able to do it. So I think that leadership part of it was really cool for him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite rare for a team that\u2019s drafting No. 1 not to need a quarterback. But the Bears lost 14 games because the roster around Fields was terrible. That shouldn\u2019t be the case in 2023. In addition to owning the No. 1 pick, the Bears have more than $110 million in salary cap space.\n\nThat gives them by far the most ammo to improve of any team in the NFL.\n\nThe Bears, as Breer said on the air, haven\u2019t gotten a fair evaluation of Fields yet because of how little support he\u2019s gotten.\n\nBut they do finally have an idea how to best use him. Getsy in the second half of the season did a better job tailoring the offense to maxmize Fields\u2019 strengths.\n\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got it figured out, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Getsy said. \u201cBut I think we as a group did a really nice job to put ourselves on a path towards the right direction. We have to grow, we have to be dynamic, we have to evolve even more for us to go where we want to go. We can\u2019t kind of sit still where we are at right now. We are going to use this offseason to get ourselves in a good place so that we can be dynamic when we get to this coming season.\u201d\n\nFields has proven he\u2019s as good as any quarterback in football running the ball. But for the Bears to be a complete offense, he needs to be able to consistently throw the football. Fields ranked 24th in EPA+CPOE in 2022 (.045), and that needs to improve.\n\nInjuries aren\u2019t a matter of it, but when in football, Fields can do a better job of minimizing his risk.\n\nGetsy said Fields carrying the ball \u201chas got to be a part of who you are. In the NFL, it\u2019s hard for it to be who you are. You just don\u2019t last. It\u2019s got to be a part of us and he\u2019s really, really good at it. He\u2019s really good at a lot of things. So we\u2019ve got to make sure we just tap into one of those things, but that for sure has to be a part of who we are going forward.\u201d",

            "text": "CHICAGO \u2013 For a second-straight year, the NFL is saying goodbye to one of the greatest quarterbacks in league history, and Bears fans are probably happy about that.\n\nTom Brady took to social media to announce his retirement on Wednesday, saying this time it\u2019s \u201cfor good\u201d as he brings his 23-year career to an end.\n\nDuring his 20 years with the Patriots and three with the Buccaneers, Brady made a habit of giving opposing teams a lot of problems on the field, and the Bears were no exception.\n\nSo how did the quarterback do when facing the squad from Chicago?\n\nBrady finished his career against the Bears with a 6-1 record as a starter, including a perfect 5-0 mark while a member of the Patriots. In 2000, when New England traveled to Chicago, Brady was inactive in his rookie year with the team when the Bears defeated the Patriots 24-17.\n\nHis first game was a memorable one on November 10, 2002 in Champaign, the Bears\u2019 temporary home for that season as Soldier Field was being renovated. Brady rallied the reigning Super Bowl champions from a 27-6 deficit in the second half, throwing a touchdown to David Patten with 21 seconds left to give New England a 33-30 victory.\n\nThe next match-up with the Bears would once again be a close one, this time at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough on November 26, 2006. Despite a slow offensive performance that included a pair of interceptions, Brady\u2019s fourth quarter touchdown pass to Ben Watson was the difference in a 17-13 win.\n\nThe next two match-ups between Brady and the Bears were blowouts, the first coming on December 12, 2010 in a Soldier Field snowstorm. It didn\u2019t bother the quarterback as he threw for 369 yards and two touchdowns in a 36-7 rout in Chicago.\n\nFour years later, on October 26, 2014, it was another lopsided affair as the Patriots beat the Bears 51-23 in Foxborough, with Brady throwing five touchdown passes.\n\nThings were a bit closer when Brady faced the Bears for the last time as a Patriot on October 21, 2018 at Soldier Field. The quarterback threw for 277 yards, three touchdowns with an interception as the Patriots held onto win 38-31.\n\nMitchell Trubisky\u2019s \u201chail mary\u201d completion to Kevin White on the final play of the game was stopped at the 1-yard line by New England.\n\n(Jeff Haynes/AP Images for Panini)\n\nFinally, in their sixth match-up against the quarterback on October 8, 2020, the Bears finally got a win against Brady, who was now a member of the Buccaneers.\n\nThanks to a strong defensive push from the front seven that included three sacks and eight quarterback hits, the Bears knocked off Tampa Bay 20-19. Many would remember the contest as the one where Brady lost track of downs on the Buccaneers\u2019 final drive, which help the hosts secure the victory.\n\n(Photo by Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images)\n\nIn Brady\u2019s final game against the Bears on October 24, 2021, he returned to the form he had against the team throughout most of his career. The quarterback threw for 211 yards and four touchdowns in the Buccaneers\u2019 38-3 win at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nIn seven starts against the Bears, Brady completed 67 percent of his passes for 2,059 yards for 19 touchdowns compared to four interceptions. His 105.9 ranking was his fourth-highest against any opponent in the NFL.",

But not as different as it could have been following one of the worst seasons in the team\u2019s history.

The defensive backs coaching vacancy has been filled.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Bears, Jon Hoke will be the Bears\u2019 next defensive backs coach and is coming from the Falcons\u2013where Gray was just hired\u2026 Hoke does have prior coaching experience with the Bears:\n\n\u201cHoke boasts 42 years of coaching experience, including 18 seasons in the NFL and spent the last two seasons as the Falcons\u2019 secondary coach. Hoke returns to the Bears after spending six seasons with the club as the defensive backs coach from 2009-14, a period in which the Bears defense tied for the fourth-most interceptions (111) and lead the league in interceptions returned for touchdowns (20).\u201d\n\nThe Bears secondary had pretty good success with Hoke. He was there towards the end of Charles Tilliman\u2019s career with the Bears. Tillman helped the Bears learn his famous \u201cPeanut Punch\u201d during spring practice last season.\n\nThey also announced a few minor Chicago Bears coaching staff changes:\n\n\u201cZach Cable (offensive quality control), Isaiah Harris (player engagement/strength & conditioning) and Pierre Ngo (assistant strength & conditioning).\u201d\n\nFor More Great Chicago Sports Content\n\nFollow us on Twitter at @chicitysports23 for more great content.

            "text": "The coming year is mostly about which players the Chicago Bears will add to the roster, but at least a couple of starters are prime candidates to be cut.\n\nJoe Tansey of Bleacher Report on Wednesday, February 1, suggested that the Bears seriously consider parting ways with both offensive lineman Lucas Patrick and defensive tackle Justin Jones. The primary motivation for those moves would be allowing Chicago to add to its league-leading salary cap number of approximately $100 million, as tallied by Spotrac.\n\nBoth Patrick and Jones were regular starters for the Bears when healthy in 2022, but the offensive and defensive lines are each top priorities heading into the offseason. Patrick carries a cap hit of nearly $5.4 million next season, while Jones\u2019 cap hit is $7.4 million. Both are slotted to hit unrestricted free agency in 2024.\n\nLucas Patrick Failed to Play to Contract After Joining Bears in 2022\n\nChicago was excited about Patrick after signing him away from the rival Green Bay Packers last year, with general manger Ryan Poles offering high praise of the positionally versatile offensive lineman on his way into the fold.\n\n\u201cThe things he was screaming on the phone after we got a deal done kind of showed what he\u2019s all about,\u201d Poles said in March. \u201cHe embodies that. He\u2019s a prick, and he knows it. And that\u2019s how he survives, and that\u2019s what we need up front.\u201d\n\nThe biggest problem for Patrick was that he was unable to survive up front, at least in terms of his availability. Patrick played in just seven of 17 games for the Bears in his initial campaign, starting five of those. That was due to a toe injury he suffered in Week 7 against the New England Patriots, which ultimately required surgery and cost the offensive lineman the rest of the season.\n\nWhen he was on the field, his performance was well below the league average. Pro Football Focus gave Patrick an overall grade of 55.9 at the center position, including grades of 62.5 as a run blocker and an abysmal 30.8 as a pass blocker.\n\n\u201cThe Bears have a few offensive linemen on their roster that they would love to keep in starting spots, including Teven Jenkins,\u201d Tansey wrote. \u201cA top-tier addition on the outside could force someone like Jenkins back to the inside, which would keep playing time away from Patrick. \u2026 He could be let go at a relatively low cost to pursue a better opportunity elsewhere.\u201d\n\nJustin Jones May be Out in Chicago Due to D-Line Additions\n\nWhile Jones\u2019 advanced analytics also fell short of spectacular during his first year in Chicago, the 2022 team captain is less on the chopping block due to his performance and availability, and more so because the Bears are expected to push for big-time upgrades at his position.\n\nJones started all 17 games last season, amassing 52 tackles, including 12 tackles for loss, seven quarterback hits, four passes defensed, three sacks and one fumble recovery, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nHowever, Chicago is expected to be an active free agent player for defensive tackles like Daron Payne of the Washington Commanders and Javon Hargrave of the Philadelphia Eagles. The Bears may also look to the defensive tackle position in the upcoming NFL Draft.\n\nChicago owns the top overall pick, though the team is expected to trade down at least once, most likely either to No. 2 with the Houston Texans or No. 4 with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nDepending on how everything shakes out at the top of the draft, the Bears may find themselves able to select Jalen Carter out of the University of Georgia, who is projected to be a generational talent at defensive tackle and is currently the top prospect across all positions in the 2023 class, according to the big board of ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper Jr.",

            "text": "The Tom Brady era is officially over. For good this time.\n\nThe 45-year-old, seven-time Super Bowl champion announced his retirement Wednesday morning with a video posted to his social media channels. Brady retired last offseason but unretired after just 40 days, electing to return for one more run with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe legendary quarterback insists that this time there will be no takebacks.\n\nTruly grateful on this day. Thank you \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bb\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f pic.twitter.com/j2s2sezvSS \u2014 Tom Brady (@TomBrady) February 1, 2023\n\nWith Brady hanging it up, several teams expected to be in the market for a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback now must look elsewhere. The Las Vegas Raiders, New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, and Bucs now must pivot their quarterback carousel plans away from dreams of having the GOAT suit up for them.\n\nWhile the Bears were never going to be swimming in the Brady pool this offseason, his retirement should impact their offseason plans in a few ways.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the obvious.\n\nWith Brady no longer a lead option in offseason quarterback market, several teams will have to pivot their attention to Aaron Rodgers and Derek Carr.\n\nThe Raiders, who are moving on from Carr, were long seen as the presumed landing spot for Brady. Now, the Silver and Black will either have to make a hard push for Rodgers \u2013 should the Packers decide to trade the 39-year-old \u2013 or look at a potential trade-up in the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Raiders currently own the No. 7 overall pick and have the future trade assets to potentially entice the Bears into a draft deal. At the very least, the Raiders potentially entering the trade-up discussion allows the Bears to create more leverage in possible talks with the Houston Texans (No. 2 overall) and Indianapolis Colts (No. 4 overall).\n\nBrady removing himself from the carousel makes the Rodgers drama the marquee attraction for the offseason, with the Bears primed to take advantage of whichever teams don\u2019t land their archnemesis or Carr.\n\nThe Jets now appear to be a potential sleeper entrant in the expected trade sweepstakes for the No. 1 pick.\n\nThe Jets have a ready-to-win roster but have a gaping hole at quarterback. After Zach Wilson\u2019s Year 2 implosion, head coach Robert Saleh probably can\u2019t afford to trot Wilson back out next season, or he\u2019ll risk losing the locker room.\n\nIf the Packers don\u2019t trade Rodgers or the Jets aren\u2019t the winning bidder, New York might have to pivot into another swing at a quarterback in the draft. The Jets own the No. 13 pick in the draft, so a trade up to No. 1 would likely cost them several first-round picks, similar to what the 49ers gave up in 2021 to move from No. 12 to No. 3.\n\nCarr is the wild card in this scenario. The Raiders must trade or cut him before Feb. 15, when his $40 million salary is fully guaranteed. If the Jets are interested in Carr, they must decide soon. There\u2019s no guarantee the Rodgers situation will be resolved by then.\n\nIf the Jets choose to wait for the possibility of a Rodgers trade, that could put them in a bind should he not be traded or be dealt elsewhere. That could up the desperation meter on the need to make a potential big draft move up for Bryce Young or C.J. Stroud.\n\nThat brings us to the Bucs, who currently have no quarterback.\n\nTampa Bay could opt to go the veteran route, grabbing Carr or perhaps Jimmy Garoppolo and trying to win a mediocre NFC South with someone under Brady\u2019s weight class.\n\nIf the Bucs choose not to go the patch-and-play route, they could opt for a medium or full-scale rebuild.\n\nTampa choosing that path could potentially open the door for the Bears to make a run at the No. 1 wide receiver they desperately need in Mike Evans.\n\nAt 29, Evans still is at the peak of his powers and would give the Bears the downfield, jump-ball threat they need to help quarterback Justin Fields take the next step.\n\nThe Bears traded their second-round pick for Chase Claypool but should have several draft assets coming in once the expected trade down from the No. 1 spot is executed.\n\nSuppose the price for Evans is a second-round pick or a future first. In that case, I\u2019d expect the Bears to be very interested in making a run at adding a go-to receiver who can allow Claypool and Darnell Mooney to operate in roles they are more suited to handle.\n\nAfter 23 seasons, Brady bid adieu to the NFL on Wednesday and perhaps unknowingly gave the Bears a parting gift in the process.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "With James Rowe leaving for the college ranks, the Chicago Bears needed a new coach for their cornerbacks. They looked into veteran names like Jerry Gray and Chris Harris. Both landed with other teams. In the end, head coach Matt Eberflus decided to reach back to the past for a familiar face. The Bears announced on Wednesday that they\u2019d made some changes to their coaching staff, headlined by the hiring of Jon Hoke as the new passing game coordinator and cornerbacks coach.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoke is one of the most well-traveled assistant coaches in the NFL. He\u2019s 66 years old and brings four decades of experience. He spent six season with the Bears from 2009 to 2014, helping them to become one of the best defenses in the NFL at forcing turnovers. Charles Tillman and Tim Jennings reached multiple Pro Bowls under his watch. He also helped a rookie Kyle Fuller get his career started with four interceptions. This man knows the style of defense Eberflus wants to play. So this hire makes plenty of sense.\n\n\u201cThe Bears on Wednesday announced several changes among the coaching staff and football operations. New additions to the coaching staff include Jon Hoke (cornerbacks/passing game coordinator), Zach Cable (offensive quality control), Isaiah Harris (player engagement/strength & conditioning) and Pierre Ngo (assistant strength & conditioning). Promotions were announced for Omar Young (assistant quarterbacks and wide receivers coach) and Carla Suber (director of wellness). Additionally, Mike Wiley Jr. has been named director of mental skills/performance.\u201d\n\nHoke should provide what the Chicago Bears are looking for.\n\nWhile his pass defenses since leaving the team have been hit and miss, one thing that has remained constant is the ability of his defensive backs to force turnovers. It was true in Tampa Bay with guys like Brent Grimes and Keith Tandy and again in Atlanta with A.J. Terrell and Jaylinn Hawkins. Hoke knows how to coach players the right way in this defense. He should be able to help Jaylon Johnson, who only has one interception in his career to this point. Eddie Jackson and Kyler Gordon will love him.\n\nThe truth is this might be the most talented secondary Hoke has coached in years. You have a former All-Pro in Jackson, and three former 2nd round picks in Gordon, Johnson, and Jaquan Brisker. It is a young and athletic group with tons of upside. If the Chicago Bears can get a better pass rush in front of them, Hoke will have them stealing footballs left and right. It might not be a flashy hire, but it\u2019s one that makes sense for what they are trying to accomplish.",

It is probably valuable that the Chicago Bears were in a position where Ryan Poles was able to watch a rebuild and learn as his mistakes were not completely crushing the team. Still, after we wrote about his best moves, you had to know that a fair look at some of his worst decisions was coming.\n\nWhat are the five worst decisions that Ryan Poles has made?\n\nThe Chicago Bears should have drafted George Pickens\n\nThis is one that will sit with Chicago Bears fans for a while. It also seems to be a topic of conversation every time George Pickens makes a big play, which happens to be a lot. Pickens had over 800 yards receiving this season and went 52 overall in the 2022 NFL draft. He was the fourth-best in yards by rookie wideouts, and that is with Kenny Pickett and Mitch Trubisky as his quarterback.\n\nThis means the Chicago Bears passed on a receiver twice, and he had over 300 more yards than any Bears wide receiver and he is just 21 years old. This is a big issue. What makes the decision crazy is that everyone, pundits, fans, and experts, all said that wide receiver was a huge need. They all said that George Pickens was the best on the board. They all said that Pickens would fit with Justin Fields.\n\nWhen you see that a lot of what Fields did was deep balls, and jump balls, and a lot of what Pickens did was deep balls and jump balls, it has to make Bears fans feel sick knowing what they missed out on.\n\nAfter George Pickens was Alec Pierce, who had a nice rookie season. Still, after that, it was Skyy Moore, Velus Jones, Jalen Tolbert, David Bell, Danny Gray, Erik Eziknama, Romeo Doubs, and Calvin Austin just to round out the fourth round.\n\nDoubs hit 400 yards, and he joins Skyy Moore and David Bell as the only wideouts drafted after Pickens to hit 200 yards. Pickens doubled the best wide-out taken after, and had about four times as much as any third-round or later wide-out.\n\nThere was a tier drop after Pickens and Ryan Poles did not see it. While no receivers were drafted after Pickens with success, the list of cornerbacks taken after Kyler Gordon is pretty impressive.\n\nCordale Flott, Marcus Jones, Coby Bryant, Josh Williams, Pepe Williams, and Tariq Woolen went between pick 81-153 and were taken in that order. All of these cornerbacks were better than Kyler Gordon this season.\n\nThey may not all have the same upside, but in the case of someone like Woolen, it is hard to see Kyler Gordon ever being that good. Even Bryant and Jones have flashed in the slot. Josh Williams is playing in the playoffs.\n\nRyan Poles had to know the pockets in the draft and that he could wait on a cornerback, but could not wait on a wide receiver. Pickens fell right into his lap and every wideout after he struggled. Gordon was looked as a questionable decision at the time because of the need for a guy like Pickens, and that remains the case now.\n\n!\u2014pageview_candidate\u2014>",

    "tldr": "\n\nThe Chicago Bears have made several changes to their coaching staff, hiring Jon Hoke as passing game coordinator and cornerbacks coach, Zach Cable as defensive backs coach, Isaiah Harris as strength & conditioning director and Omar Young as assistant quarterbacks and wide receivers coach. Additionally, the team is looking to trade down from the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft for value at another position while sticking with Justin Fields at quarterback. Tom Brady's retirement has also opened up possibilities for the Bears such as making a run at Tampa Bay Buccaneers' wide receiver Mike Evans or taking advantage of other teams in potential trade-up scenarios. Finally, Ryan Poles' first year as General Manager has been difficult due to his decisions on draft day but he will look to make amends this season with new hires and strategic moves during free agency and the draft."
