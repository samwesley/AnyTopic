The second place team will receive $25,000; third place, $10,000; and fourth place, $5,000.\n\nFirst and second place winners in the elevator pitch competition \u2014 decided by an audience vote \u2014 win $3,000 and $2,000, respectively.\n\n\"We are incredibly excited to host the Heartland Challenge in Bentonville again this year,\" said Deb Williams, senior director of operations and student programs at the U of A Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation.\n\n\"This competition exposes founders from across the globe to the burgeoning entrepreneurial ecosystem in Northwest Arkansas and helps them gain valuable connections and experience as they develop and build their ventures.\"\n\nThe competition is hosted again this year by the Sam M. Walton College of Business and overseen by the Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, with generous support from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation. Early sponsorships secured for the 2023 competition include WhyteSpyder, ArcBest, Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield, ECHO Innovation Alliance and NewRoad Capital Partners.\n\nThe Startup Expo, returning for its second year, will feature a public showcase of the competitors.

The winner will receive $5,000.\n\nPast winners have included technology startups focused on the music industry and improving cancer detection, as well as a recycling-based building materials company.\n\nAurign, a music publishing startup from Georgia State University, took home first place in 2020, securing $50,000 for their idea of using blockchain technology to securely file music-publishing documents.\n\nNurLabs, a graduate student startup team from the University of California at Los Angeles, won the 2021 Heartland Challenge. The team, which developed a patent-pending, non-traditional, non-invasive liquid biopsy platform to detect cancer earlier, used its winnings to expand the size and scope of a lung cancer study.\n\nLast year's winner, KLAW Industries, used its prize money to purchase a tractor trailer to transport its product. Founded by students at Binghamton University, KLAW processes glass from landfills into a powdered cement replacement, dubbed Pantheon, which the company sells to ready-mix concrete plants. The new mixture results in concrete with more compressive strength and a lower carbon footprint.\n\nJacob Kumpon, KLAW's co-founder and chief operating officer, said the Heartland Challenge was a memorable and transformative experience for his company.\n\n\"Winning the Heartland Challenge took KLAW Industries to the next level by giving us the connections, experience and funding to acquire our first customers,\" Kumpon said.\n\nHe added that visiting Bentonville \"was fantastic\" and praised the competition's overall experience.\n\n\"I'd say this is probably one of the competitions that does it the best, encouraging teams to get out there and build relationships that will last a lifetime.\"\n\nAbout the U of A Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation: The Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation creates and curates innovation and entrepreneurship experiences for students across all disciplines.

Jan 24 (Reuters) - Paris-based quantum computer startup PASQAL on Tuesday said it had raised 100 million euros ($109 million) and aims to deliver major commercial advantages over classical computers by next year using the fresh funds.\n\nThe investment is the biggest private funding round for a quantum computer startup in Europe, according to Georges-Olivier Reymond, CEO and co-founder of PASQAL. It comes as the stock price collapse of three New York-listed quantum computer makers, IonQ Inc (IONQ.N), Rigetti Computing , and D-wave Quantum has made funding for the sector challenging.\n\n\"As the other companies will probably struggle to find cash and so forth, maybe it's a good opportunity for us to take the talents that are available,\" Reymond told Reuters, adding that PASQAL planned to double its headcount to about 200 this year.\n\nPASQAL recently sold two quantum computers to France and Germany for high-performance computing centers, and Alain Aspect, one of PASQAL's founders, won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for experiments in quantum mechanics that laid the groundwork for quantum computing.\n\nScientists expect quantum computers could one day make certain calculations millions of times faster than the fastest super computers today.\n\nFor now, Reymond said, the company's quantum computer was able to solve complex financial optimization problems as accurately as classical computers and hopes it will show an advantage soon.\n\n\"When we release the next generation of devices with hundreds of qubits, hopefully 1,000, showcasing a true quantum advantage with this technology, that will be the inflection point in revenue,\" he said about when revenue could accelerate.\n\nThe number of qubits, or quantum bits, is an indication of the power of the quantum computer. PASQAL's most recent computer has 350 qubits.\n\nThe funding round was led by new investor Temasek, Singapore's state-owned investment firm. Other new investors include the European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Saudi Aramco's Wa\u2019ed Ventures and Bpifrance.\n\nReporting By Jane Lanhee Lee.
