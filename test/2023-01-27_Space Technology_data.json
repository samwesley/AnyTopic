READ MORE\n\nSpace Force\u2019s head of acquisition only started last summer, but he is well into efforts to shake up the way his agency does business. Frank Calvelli serves as the first assistant secretary of the Air Force for space acquisition and integration, a position Congress created to quell the cacophony of so many agencies overseeing space procurements.\n\nAlthough Space Force is only a few years old, the problems surrounding space acquisition predate the service. Building satellites and space communication previously fell to different services that didn\u2019t always have perfect communication with each other. That caused redundancies in some cases, and equipment that didn\u2019t match well enough to work together in other cases.\n\n\u201cThe traditional ways of doing space acquisition must be reformed in order to add speed to our acquisitions to meet our priorities in the department. To gain speed, we must shorten development timelines by building smaller systems,\u201d Calvelli said at the Defense and Intelligence in Space Conference on Jan. 24.\n\nHe said ground and software intensive systems need to be acquired in smaller, more manageable pieces that can be delivered faster and use existing technology that doesn\u2019t need to be invented to be delivered. As part of his efforts to reorganize acquisition, Calvelli came up with a list of points to improve the process.\n\nFirst, he said build smaller and reduce your non-recurring engineering, and then get the acquisition strategy correct.\n\n\u201cWe have a culture we have to break. It\u2019s a culture of new. It\u2019s a culture of technology. The government, industry, we both like to drive new technologies as part of an acquisition contract,\u201d said Calvelli. \u201cWe like to build new, new is cool. But we have to stop building new and we have to take advantage of existing designs.\u201d\n\nHe said building new prolongs the schedule and creates situations where contracts go to cost-plus because of the risks involved in building new designs. Contracting officers and program managers need to work as a team, and part of that means only awarding executable contracts.\n\nCalvelli said he frequently sees contracts getting changed and extended. The way to fix stability in a program is to shorten timelines to no more than three years from authorization to launch, and it has to be fixed price. When contracts go on for too long, they end up being renegotiated.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an approach that I really haven\u2019t seen before until I got to the department, which is using multiple contract actions to develop something. It adds instability to a program that we need to stop. So the way to fix a program based on instability is shorten the contract timelines to three years or less,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother area Calvelli wants to reform involves avoiding special access programs (SAPs) and over-classification. He previously worked for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), where he said they were able to break down barriers to system integration by getting rid of SAPs.\n\n\u201c[The Defense Department] is about 30 years behind the NRO in terms of classification. In DoD, every single program is either going to be unclassified, or you go into a SAP. And we have to break that paradigm. We are collapsing SAPs as we speak, we\u2019re consolidating down,\u201d Calvelli said.\n\nWhile Calvelli said he sees plenty of ways to reform the acquisition process, he is quick to point out that contractors also have a role in improving performance. He said he wants to see contracting officers take a more active role in oversight, and not just leave it to prime contractors to make sure everything is delivered on schedule and without cost overruns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to change that culture at the Pentagon with my program executive officers, that we need to be a more demanding customer,\u201d he said.",

This annual award honors a space agency, company, or consortium of organizations in the realm of space exploration and discovery.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope team represents the best of our humanity and an enduring pursuit to better understand the cosmos. Every new image is a new discovery,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Webb is the culmination of decades of persistence and once-unthinkable human ingenuity made possible by international partnerships. Together, we are unfolding the universe and inspiring the world.\"\n\nThe award will be presented at the Space Foundation's yearly opening ceremony of the Space Symposium in Colorado on April 17.\n\n\"Within its first year of operations, the work and revelations by the James Webb Space Telescope team has opened an entirely new chapter of knowledge and inspiration that will forever change our lives and history,\" said Space Foundation CEO Tom Zelibor. \"This is an unparalleled achievement and is transforming astronomy and space science while delivering new inspiration and imagination to every generation and corner of our planet. The partnerships and collaborations between nations, researchers, industry members, and more have also highlighted the incredible things we can do together as we promote knowledge.\"\n\nWebb, the world's premier space science telescope, launched Dec. 25, 2021. In 2022, the Webb team successfully completed an intricate series of deployments to unfold the observatory into its final configuration in space. They then precisely aligned its mirrors to within nanometers, set up and tested its powerful instruments, and officially began Webb's mission to explore the infrared universe.\n\nWith its optics performing nearly twice as well as the mission required, Webb is discovering some of the earliest galaxies ever observed, peering through dusty clouds to see stars forming , and delivering a more detailed view of the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system than ever before. Webb has also captured new views of planets within our solar system, including the clearest look at Neptune's rings in decades. The Swigert award, which pays tribute to NASA astronaut Jack Swigert for his legacy of space exploration, will recognize the contributions of the team members who designed, developed, and now operate the Webb mission.\n\n\"Our vast and dedicated team on the James Webb Space Telescope mission is already bringing us closer and closer to seeing the earliest, most distant galaxies that shine in our universe,\" said Sandra Connelly, acting associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. \"Webb is an international collaboration involving a group of thousands of diverse people that has launched NASA into a new era of world-class science and is revolutionizing our view of the cosmos.\"\n\nRecent winners of the John L. \"Jack\" Swigert, Jr. Award include NASA and the University of Arizona OSIRIS-REx team, the teams behind the NASA JPL Mars Ingenuity Helicopter and InSight-Mars Cube One, NASA Dawn, and Cassini.\n\nWebb, an international mission led by NASA with its partners ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency), is the world's premier space science observatory. Its design pushed the boundaries of space telescope capabilities to solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.\n\nNASA Headquarters in Washington oversees the Webb mission. NASA Goddard manages Webb for the agency and oversees work on the mission performed by the Space Telescope Science Institute, Northrop Grumman, and other mission partners, including Ball Aerospace. In addition to Goddard, several NASA centers contributed to the project, including the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Jet Propulsion Laboratory in southern California, Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, and others.\n\nRecently, the Webb mission's accomplishments also have been recognized by organizations including the National Space Club and Foundation , National Air and Space Museum , Aviation Week , Bloomberg Businessweek , Popular Science , and TIME .\n\nFor more information about the Webb mission, visit:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/webb\n\nSOURCE NASA",

            "text": "Asteroid mining has long caught the imagination of space entrepreneurs, but conventional wisdom has always been that it\u2019s little more than a pipe dream. That may be about to change after a startup announced plans to launch two missions this year designed to validate its space mining technology.\n\nThere are estimated to be trillions of dollars worth of precious metals locked up in asteroids strewn throughout the solar system. Given growing concerns about the scarcity of key materials required for batteries and other electronics, there\u2019s been growing interest in attempts to extract these resources.\n\nThe enormous cost of space missions and the huge technical challenges involved in mining in space have led many to dismiss the idea as unworkable. The industry has already seen one boom and bust cycle after leading players like Deep Space Industries folded after investors lost their nerve.\n\nBut now, California-based startup AstroForge has taken concrete steps toward its goal of becoming the first company to mine an asteroid and bring the materials back to Earth. This year it will launch two missions, one designed to test out its in-space mineral extraction technology and another that will carry out a survey mission of a promising asteroid close to Earth.\n\n\u201cWith a finite supply of precious metals on Earth, we have no other choice than to look to deep space to source cost-effective and sustainable materials,\u201d CEO and co-founder Matt Gialich said in a statement.\n\nThe company, which raised $13 million in seed funding last April, is planning to target asteroids rich in platinum group metals in deep space. These materials are in major demand in many high-tech industries, but their reserves are limited and geographically concentrated. Extracting them can also be very environmentally damaging.\n\nAstroForge is developing mineral refining technology that it hopes will allow it to extract precious metals from these asteroids and return them to Earth. A prototype will catch a lift into orbit on a spacecraft designed by OrbAstro and launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in April. It will be pre-loaded with asteroid-like material, which it will then attempt to vaporize and sort into its different chemical constituents.\n\nThen in October, the company will attempt an even more ambitious mission. A 220-pound spacecraft also designed by OrbAstro, called Brokkr-2, will attempt an 8-month journey to reach an asteroid orbiting the sun about 22 million miles from Earth. It will carry a host of instruments designed to assess the target asteroid in situ.\n\nBoth of these missions are precursors designed to test out systems that will be needed for AstroForge\u2019s first proper asteroid mining mission, expected later this decade. The company plans to target asteroids between 66 to 4,920 feet in diameter and break them apart from a distance before collecting the remains.\n\nEven if these missions are a success, there\u2019s still a long road towards making space mining practical. According to research AstroForge recently conducted with the Colorado School of Mines, the bulk of metal-rich asteroids are found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, which is currently a 14-year round trip.\n\nNonetheless, off-world mining does appear to be having somewhat of a renaissance, with dozens of space resources startups springing up in recent years. If AstroForge succeeds in proving out its technology this year, it could give this fledgling industry a major boost.\n\nImage Credit: NASA",

            "text": "You may not have known that space needs tugboats, but now you do \u2014 and Atomos Space just closed a $16.2 million Series A investment, which will enable the company to complete its demonstration mission where it will show off its docking and towing capabilities. The company is building a series of Orbital Transfer Vehicles (OTV) that makes it possible to reposition satellites in space. The theory is that, by making it possible to move flying objects into different orbits, they don\u2019t have to have full navigation capabilities themselves, which in turn should make operating spacecraft much cheaper. The company claims its existence effectively halves the launch costs of satellite operators.\n\nThe company is starting with high-powered electric propulsion systems, and is eager to share that it sees those propulsion methods as stepping stones for its nuclear OTV options, which would be able to travel faster and farther, and offering commercial mobility services. The company is also positioning itself to be able to use these technologies for asteroid deflection, effectively putting Harry Stamper out of a job.\n\n\u201cI worked on launch vehicle design, and then spacecraft propulsion system design and also some advanced technologies for moving around in space, and realized very quickly that how we do space logistics is sub-optimal. The best analogy that we use is with aircraft. Imagine you have a single-use plane, you are the sole passenger, and you have to take everything with you, unable to do shopping on the way. So if you want to drive around at your end destination, you need to take the car and you need to take gas with you,\u201d explains Vanessa Clark, CEO and co-founder of Atomos Space. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s very expensive and limited. What we really need is a hub and spoke logistics model for space. This allows us to do really cool things, commercial missions like Earth observation, global communications, broadband internet, but it also allows us to take the next step as a species and do more things in deep space that makes sense economically and from a scientific perspective.\u201d\n\nThis is the company\u2019s third round of VC funding, and so far it has built and tested on the ground, including its docking and propulsion systems. The next big step is to fly the first vehicle.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot of autonomy. We are working on having a self-driving satellite that can detect and navigate to a client and grab onto it safely. We have the ability to optimize our propulsion system for operating just in space, unlike a launch vehicle that also has to design for getting into space,\u201d Clark highlights the company\u2019s competitive advantage. \u201cThat means we can go farther and use less propellant. With this new round of funding we\u2019re finishing the build of our first two vehicles, and we have booked a launch in just under 12 months. It\u2019s going to be a really exciting mission, where we are flying two full-size commercial vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe first use cases of the technology is to take launched satellites to their final destinations and to reposition satellites mid-mission. When vehicles have reached their end of service, they can be moved to graveyard orbits, or disposal orbits so that they can burn up in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cOur goal as a company is to make any orbit as accessible as low Earth orbit (LEO). On Earth, if you want to send something overseas, it is as easy as sending a package to the next town over. You just go to the post office. We want that to be possible for space,\u201d explains Clark. \u201cWe want to be operating a fleet of orbital transit vehicles in Earth orbit that can provide the vast missions for a set of clients, spacecraft operators, Space Station operators and also companies and agencies that want to explore beyond the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe company is particularly excited about nuclear propulsion in space, and are investing heavily on that front, telling us it offers an order of magnitude improvement in speed and payload capabilities.\n\nWith the current round of funding, the company says it will double the size of the team and launch its first two OTVs in early 2024. The investment was led by Cantos Ventures and the Yamauchi No. 10 Family Office (that\u2019s the family that founded Nintendo), with participation from Upheaval Investments, Dolby Family Ventures, Arden Road Investments, Elefund and Techstars.",

            "text": "Eisenhower Executive Office Building\n\n2:35 P.M. EST\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Hi, everyone. (Applause.) Have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome.\n\n\n\nDeanna, you are just \u2014 you are a superstar \u2014 the superheroes and a superstar. Thank you so very much.\n\n\n\nAnd to the boys, thank you, guys. Aiden, we are so motivated by your mom and the two of you, as young leaders on this issue. Your voice has been so important.\n\n\n\nAnd to everyone here, welcome. Thank you for convening on this Friday afternoon. I know it\u2019s been a good day of a lot of important discussion and meeting about our plan for 2023 to continue in this movement, which is such an important movement.\n\n\n\nWe have here \u2014 as I\u2019m sure you know, we have elected leaders. We have community leaders. We have labor leaders. We have our partners in the private sector, foundation folks all together under one roof to show that when we work together on an issue like this \u2014 which is seemingly intractable, you would think, based on the length of time that it\u2019s been an issue without resolution. But coming together under this roof, at this moment, to really build on the momentum of the work that so many of you have been doing for years and years to see the success and see it through.\n\n\n\nSo, on behalf of myself, our administration and the President, and, of course, Administrator Regan: I welcome you and look forward to our discussion.\n\n\n\nAnd, Mayor, I just \u2014 I want to hear later what was the joke about the weatherman and the sportsman. (Laughter.) You just can\u2019t help yourself, but you\u2019re so good. So thank you for all the work you\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nAnd with that, we\u2019ll get started. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: All right. Good afternoon.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: So, first of all, Madam Vice President, we want to thank you for convening everyone in this room. You haven\u2019t missed anyone. We have labor, nonprofits, our agencies, and the private sector, all who are here with one thing in mind, and that\u2019s to get lead pipes out of all of our communities.\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019ve had the honor of traveling all across the country with Madam Vice President. We\u2019ve had some fun, but it\u2019s a serious \u2014 it\u2019s a serious, serious matter. We\u2019ve traveled to cities like Newark, New Jersey; Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And we\u2019ve seen firsthand the challenges that our communities are facing.\n\n\n\nMadam Vice President, it\u2019s been an honor to travel with you. And I\u2019ve seen firsthand your commitment to clean water and also environmental justice.\n\n\n\nTalk to us about why that\u2019s a priority for you and this administration.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, when I look at these two young leaders here, with their mother Deanna, that\u2019s why it\u2019s a priority as much as anything.\n\n\n\nAnd again, I just want to thank you, Deanna, because we spent some time together. A year ago \u2014 she and I were spending some time before we walked in here. A year ago, January of last year, is when we first met. And you told the story of Aiden, which is, sadly, a story that many mothers and fathers and parents around our country can tell, which is about the clear injustice of it all as much as anything.\n\n\n\nWhen we think about fundamental rights, we should understand that it should be a right of every occupant of this Earth, and certainly of our country, to have clean water. Let\u2019s just start there.\n\n\n\nOkay, then let us understand, because many may not be aware, sadly, that it is not a right that is guaranteed to all the occupants of our country; that in many communities, families, children, parents cannot take for granted that they will turn on a tap and that clean water will come out. And I think we would all agree there is nothing about this that should be considered a luxury or an option. It is essential to the sustenance of life and the wellbeing of all of the people on our planet.\n\n\n\nAnd I keep referring to the world and the planet because this is, sadly, not only true for here in the United States and for us as Americans, but it is a global issue, in terms of the proportion. And we will at some point talk about, I think, the optimism and belief that we all have that our collective work will have a global impact because of the model we will set, based on the work we do in our own country. So I think of it that way.\n\n\n\nAnd then I think of the issue as connected with environmental justice, because it doesn\u2019t take much data or scientific opinion for us to realize and know that access to clean water is often a function of one\u2019s socioeconomic condition, geographic location, race, and ethnicity.\n\n\n\nIt does not take much investigation or knowledge to know that, for example, the communities where lead pipes still exist \u2014 and will be eradicated because of the Administrator\u2019s work, because of our President\u2019s priority, because of our collective priority will be eradicated in the next nine years \u2014 but that those communities that have lead service lines and pipes are exactly those communities that are socioeconomically low income and are invariably communities of color and poor communities.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to think about, \u201cWell, how did that come to be?\u201d Well, lead pipes, they were a thing at a time. So they weren\u2019t only in those communities. Yes, that\u2019s true. However, when it became clear that, through those lead pipes, the water that was produced results in severe and significant public health consequences, including learning issues for the children, that communities that had resources could eradicate it themselves.\n\n\n\nIf there was a tax base that can sustain the municipality, perhaps then public entities would have removed those pipes, or homeowners who had the resources to pay the hundreds or thousands of dollars that were required would have removed those pipes.\n\n\n\nBut what about the folks who are living in communities where they\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck and couldn\u2019t possibly \u2014 if they are renters or homeowners \u2014 invest in the kind of resources and the kind of work that would remove those pipes?\n\n\n\nSo it is an environmental justice issue also.\n\n\n\nIt is an environmental justice issue when we think about the overlay between this issue and so many others that compound the burden that specific communities then face, because usually this will exist in the same areas where we are looking at food deserts, where we are looking at underfunded schools, where we are looking at inadequate or \u2014 or difficult access to public transportation. So this is how I think about this issue.\n\n\n\nAnd also, I think about it in the context of being a child of parents who were active in the Civil Rights Movement, who fought every day and shouted and marched for justice, which was about equality and equity and fairness and freedoms, including the freedom to live and thrive and be healthy and enjoy one\u2019s childhood, not to mention the rest of their life.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Thank you for that. And I know this summit is about clean water, but let me pick up on where you\u2019re leaving off. This administration is about building back better and investing in America. Talk to us about what this moment means to you and what this moment means to our country.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I think that we are at a very pivotal moment where \u2014 and you and I \u2014 we\u2019re friends, Michael \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 have talked about this \u2014 the Administrator \u2014 have talked about this, where this is not just a kind of incremental improvement. We are really looking at the potential for \u2014 for jumping onto a new plateau, which is another way of saying that this \u2014 this has the very real potential to be a very transformative moment.\n\n\n\nThink about it. Our team has calculated that we have probably \u2014 between the Infrastructure Law, between the Inflation Reduction Act, and some of the other work \u2014 we\u2019re probably looking at it \u2014 a federal government investment of up to a trillion dollars on these issues that are about our climate. A trillion dollars. And \u2014 (applause) \u2014 right.\n\n\n\nAnd if you then compound that with the private investment \u2014 with the investment, the longstanding investment in communities \u2014 not just dollars \u2014 of foundations and nonprofits and community organizations and labor \u2014 you look at what we have the potential, right now, in a very short window of time, proportionate to the crisis, to do transformative work. That\u2019s how I think of this moment.\n\n\n\nAnd you and I talked about entering 2023 with the theme of momentum. Let\u2019s jump on this and see what we\u2019ve got. And then do the work \u2014 the hard work of collaborating and coordinating in a way that it is about federal, state, and local government; it is about the private sector; it is about the nonprofit sector, and so on \u2014 to seize this moment. And I\u2019m very excited about it.\n\n\n\nYou know, I think about it in the context of being a devout public servant. And, you know, I was elected \u2014 my first elected office was as DA of San Francisco in 2004. And in 2005, I started one of the first environmental justice offices of any DA\u2019s office in the country. Because for those of you who are familiar with the Bay Area \u2014 I was in San Francisco; there\u2019s a community in San Francisco called Bayview Hunters Point that at the time and, sadly, still today has an annual household income of about $15,000. And as you can imagine \u2014 because it\u2019s, you know \u2014 again, it happens around the country \u2014 and that community was treated as a dumping ground. And there were bad actors.\n\n\n\nAnd so I decided, well, you know what? We need to take that on from an enforcement perspective, as well as highlighting and uplifting the voices of the community around their natural leadership. And so we took that on.\n\n\n\nAs Attorney General of California, we did some very significant work that was, again, about taking on the bad actors, but also giving voice to community.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in the Senate years, we did a lot of work that also was about water policy, which I love water policy. And again, maybe as a native Californian, but just thinking about the importance of diversifying water policy, right? Let\u2019s think about it in terms of some us grew up around, you know, what we must do around conservation, but then also recycling, storage of water \u2014 in particular underground storage \u2014 desalination. And then thinking of water policy and the climate crisis in the context also of, yes, lead pipes.\n\n\n\nBecause it is after all about water policy if water policy, part of \u2014 it is grounded \u2014 forgive the pun \u2014 in the idea that access to clean water should be a right and is an essential need, and what the climate and the extreme climate circumstances are doing to make that an issue that may go away if we are not smart, whether it be because of drought or because of floods, and what that means in terms of damaging the infrastructure and systems.\n\n\n\nExtreme weather. Look what\u2019s happened in Mississippi and how that can result in depriving a community of clean water.\n\n\n\nSo, thinking about all of that in the context then of this moment and what we, as those who are in \u2014 in these public offices, combined with all of the friends and the longstanding leaders, what we can do at this moment, I think, is very exciting.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: It is. I can tell you all that, as the EPA Administrator, I typically enter the room and know more about water policy than other principals. (Laughter.) Not so with the Vice President. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nYou know, I really am excited. It is a transformative moment. And I\u2019m excited, as EPA Administrator, about the relationships we have with our state, local, and regional partners.\n\n\n\nYou know, can you talk to us a little bit about \u2014 and you and I have talked about this \u2014 the importance of these partnerships, but also public-private partnerships?\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I think it\u2019s the only way to go, frankly. Because, you know, first of all, we, as the government \u2014 and in particular the federal government \u2014 we have the unique ability to scale. But it is in these other sectors that you have a certain depth of skill and \u2014 and knowledge that coupled then with our ability to scale can really, again, be transformative. I think of it in terms of a number of things.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s just start with jobs. I know we have labor leaders here. I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m on a quiet or maybe not-so-quiet mission to try and visit every local IBEW in the country.\n\n\n\nYou know, the work that is happening through, for example, that union that is about skills development. Four-year apprenticeships that \u2014 you know, some of us chose to acquire our knowledge through colleges and universities, but there are other highly skilled professionals who are acquiring their knowledge through these apprenticeships, which, by the way, the beauty of them, which we still need to get the word out, these are four-year rigorous programs. And while the student is in the program, they get a stipend, so they don\u2019t actually have to worry about, \u201cCan I get educated or pay my rent.\u201d They then come out with incredible skills that are about engineering and math and all of that, and are taking on jobs that allow them to raise a family, to go on a two-week vacation from time to time, and buy a home.\n\n\n\nWe need their skills. We need the skills of the folks that these apprenticeship programs are cultivating, because we can\u2019t invest a trillion dollars and then ask our private sector folks to match it, ask our foundations to match it in some way, and then no- \u2014 have nobody to do the jobs. Right? So there is that piece of it.\n\n\n\nThere is the piece of it, in terms of the collaboration, about just local, state, and federal. The President and I both started our careers in local government.\n\n\n\nI love mayors. I love mayors. (Applause.) I do. Some mayors in the house.\n\n\n\nI \u2014 you know, you \u2014 I\u2019ve talked with the mayors many times over the years. And even just recently, there was a group that was here for their conference. I mean, mayors are there on the ground. And mayors, by the way \u2014 poor thing, sometimes \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I mean, everybody knows who you are. They know where you live. They will come up to you in the grocery store, and they will talk with you at Little League games, wherever \u2014 \u201cI need this thing fixed. I need this thing addressed.\u201d\n\n\n\nMayors don\u2019t have the luxury of being theoretical about very practical issues. And they then, knowing their community, knowing where the resources are, can do the \u2014 the work of making everything that we do here hit the streets in a competent and efficient and \u2014 and effective way, including, let\u2019s really put on ourselves the importance of \u2014 of the metric of speed and haste. Meaning all these plans and ideas we have, let\u2019s get them out there and make them real, as opposed to, you know, kind of having conferences and just talking about what we\u2019re going to do.\n\n\n\nMayors are a big part of that. State leaders are a big part of that. Where we have that kind of investment is critically important to make it real in the lives of real people. But that\u2019s how I think about it.\n\n\n\nI think about in terms of the private sector. I\u2019ve been meeting with a lot of CEOs, for example, here and internationally. In fact, I convened a bunch of \u2014 of CEOs in Tokyo when I was in Japan for another reason, but to talk with them and other CEOs about: How are we talking about these jobs?\n\n\n\nI would suggest that we really, in this transformative moment where we are on the verge of creating a whole new industry and economy \u2014 a clean energy economy \u2014 let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s sit back and think about, \u201cOkay, well, how can we do this in the smartest way, where we get the most people to have access and we have equitable outcomes?\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, one of the pieces of it, on the jobs piece, is: Let\u2019s not talk about the jobs based on some fancy title. Instead, let us think about talking about the jobs that are going to be created defined by the skill that is necessary to fill the job.\n\n\n\nBack to the point of the apprenticeship, so many of the jobs that will be in a clean energy economy will not necessarily require a college degree and, therefore, will not require that individual to have to come up with tuition and be burdened with student loan debt and all of those associated burdens just to acquire the skills that are necessary to do very important jobs.\n\n\n\nSo, that\u2019s about the private sector thinking about how it is talking about the jobs that must be filled and then making that clear to educational institutions, be it labor, union, apprenticeships, or community colleges or whatever.\n\n\n\nSo, the coordination across sectors is going to be very important, again, to make all of this real and seize this moment that we have in front of us.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: You know, you\u2019ve connected a few dots for me, personally, because I\u2019ve traveled the country with the Vice President. And I\u2019ve watched her very carefully. And she does a really good job impersonating a mayor. (Laughter.) Because she goes into these churches, these homes, these communities, and engage \u2014 and talk directly to people.\n\n\n\nAt times, you can attest, it\u2019s a tough job.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: All of the stories are not as positive as Aiden\u2019s story.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: And when I think about Aiden \u2014 he\u2019s nine years old. My son Matthew is nine years old. It really hits home, and it becomes personal very quickly.\n\n\n\nAs you travel the country and as you hear story after story after story after story \u2014 and there are a lot of them \u2014\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: \u2014 too many.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: There are.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: What keeps you going?\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: This convening, as an example. I mean, Deanna keeps me going. You know, I \u2014 again, I talked to her this afternoon, but we\u2019ve talked before. I mean, the courage of people who have been through so much to stand up and speak out and to not give up, and to know what is possible and believe in it and advocate for it gives me a great deal of optimism about not only what is possible but the leadership that is out there who are partners in this process.\n\n\n\nWhat gives me a sense of hope and optimism is that \u2014 I mean, frankly, a lot of what we need to do is not rocket science. (Laughter.) It\u2019s pretty obvious. We just need to do it. (Laughter.) Right?\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: That\u2019s right.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And \u2014 and, again, in a hats-off to everyone here and so many of our colleagues who are not here, folks have been talking about this for decades. It\u2019s just been the willingness of others to listen and take it seriously and then put the resources and the priority into it.\n\n\n\nAnd again, that\u2019s why I think that this is a moment where we do have the momentum, based on a foundation that has been really well laid over many years.\n\n\n\nI mean, again, I grew up in \u2014 in the Bay Area. We \u2014 I grew up with \u201cSave the Bay.\u201d You know, I grew up with all these \u2014 this stuff has been going on for a long time. What do we need to do around water? What do we need to do around communities, empowerment?\n\n\n\nAnd now we\u2019ve got a President, we\u2019ve got an administration, we\u2019ve got leaders in the positions to actually see it through. Let\u2019s seize the moment. And that gives me a sense of optimism. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: So, we \u2014 we are at a very crucial time. This is a great moment to be in. And, you know, a lot of leaders have professed some of the things that this administration has espoused, but this administration has been successful in getting us to this point \u2014 your leadership, the President\u2019s leadership. What\u2019s the secret sauce? (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: To what? (Laughter.) To \u2014 to which part?\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: To this level of success, in terms of getting the resources, the people in the room, the rowing in the same direction.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I think it \u2014 it\u2019s almost like the law of physics: It was going to happen, because we are all headed in the same direction. And we just \u2014 we \u2014 we got it. Right? We\u2019re, again, from these different sectors.\n\n\n\nI think it\u2019s also just this clock on this issue is \u2014 is banging down the door. We think about this in terms of \u2014 in the, you know, the environmental justice movement, the movement for smarter water policy as a function also of the \u2014 of the climate movement. Right?\n\n\n\nAnd in the last only couple of years, maybe handful of years, has \u2014 for example, the U.N. unambiguously said, \u201cThis is a crisis.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor all of us who have been tracking this for years and years and years, they were going, \u201cWell, you know, they were a little ambiguous about it. Maybe \u2014 may \u2014 there are people who differ.\u201d And then, finally, with an exclamation point, \u201cNo, it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe look at what\u2019s happening in terms of extreme crisis \u2014 I was just in \u2014 in my home state of California last week at a site which is doing very important work in Southern California around underground storage of water and talking about, you know, again, that this is taking on a propotion- \u2014 -portion that on one end is about drought, on the other end is about floods. And then what do we do to capture the rainwater instead of pushing it into the ocean. And let\u2019s rethink this, because that\u2019s not very smart.\n\n\n\nBy the way, jobs and all that will come from \u2014 from rethinking how we do this and from redoing how we do it.\n\n\n\nBut I think that there is just an undeniable quality to this issue now that perhaps people could overlook before.\n\n\n\nYou look at Lake Mead. For any of us who have been tracking that, I visited Lake Mead. Just in the last 10 years, the amount of \u2014 of drought that it has experienced so that we\u2019re talking about bath tub rings of where the water was just a decade ago, much less years ago.\n\n\n\nThe wildfires. We used to talk about wildfire season in California. It\u2019s now \u2014 it\u2019s not \u201cseason\u201d; it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s all year round.\n\n\n\nHurricanes, floods. I think that the undeniability of the issue is also part of what has given us this kind of exponential push toward smart policy in the last couple of years, in spite of the work that, again, has been done on \u2014 for decades on it.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Well, I don\u2019t know about the rest of you, but there\u2019s something comforting about having a self-professed water policy nerd \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 as the Vice President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re darn right. Well, thank you. (Applause.) That\u2019s very kind. Thank you.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: (Laughs.)\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s very kind.\n\n\n\nOkay, I\u2019m also space geek. Okay? (Laughter.) Wait, but I bring that up because, to your point about just \u2014 it just occurred to me that I really should share this thought with \u2014 with folks \u2014 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking it already. But where we\u2019ve come in terms of space exploration and the technology around space and satellite technology.\n\n\n\nSo, I\u2019m the head of Space Council. And \u2014 and I really do \u2014 I really do have a strong like for space. (Laughs.) I love space. In fact, I encourage any of you who have not seen the Webb Telescope photographs \u2014 if you\u2019ve not seen it, please take a look at those photographs.\n\n\n\nYou know, for all of us who have been doing our work for a long time, we can get a bit cynical. We\u2019ve seen it all, and we just kind of \u2014 you look at those photographs \u2014 when I first saw them \u2014 we\u2019re looking billions of years ago, galaxies being formed. It\u2019s extraordinary.\n\n\n\nWhen they first handed me the \u2014 the photographs \u2014 because I\u2019m the head, so they kind of showed me a little bit before it got \u2014 it was made public \u2014 I had the most highly articulate response. \u201cWow.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nSo, included in all of the work we are doing on space technology \u2014 the satellites. So, we just launched a satellite \u2014 everyone is probably aware of this \u2014 NASA just launched a satellite that for the first time ever will give us a map of water around the globe.\n\n\n\nThink about what that will mean on this issue that for which we are convened and working. Our ability to map on a global scale where the water is \u2014 we have a sense of that \u2014 but where it\u2019s going. Is it going away? Right?\n\n\n\nAnd so you combine all of these factors. I think that we are, again, in this moment where we can exponentially just surge the work that needs to be done.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: You know, I\u2019m smiling because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s this level of enthusiasm that required me to call Bill Nelson at NASA and confess to him that my son went as an astronaut trick-or-treating. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: He did?\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: It was because of the conversation you and he had about space.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: So, who we elect matters. Let me just \u2014 (laughter and applause) \u2014\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right.\n\n\n\nWell, and \u2014 and to the point \u2014 and to that point \u2014 and Bill Nelson is so wonderful, as the Administrator of NASA \u2014 former senator from Florida, former astronaut.\n\n\n\nAnd so, what he will tell you and what \u2014 what \u2014 for those of us who have talked with astronauts while they\u2019re in space, if you \u2014 which I have \u2014 when you talk with an astronaut, I asked a very obvious question: Being in space, looking at Earth, do you have a different or a new \u2014 or what new perspective do you have about Earth looking at it from space?\n\n\n\nAnd to a one, they say, \u201cIt\u2019s so fragile.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so fragile.\u201d So when you\u2019re looking out that window from the International Space Station at Earth, how fragile it looks and how obviously interconnected we all are.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Yeah.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right?\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Yeah.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Which gets back to the heart of all of the work we\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Wow. Well, listen, I want to thank you for your leadership. And I want to thank you for convening all these wonderful people.\n\n\n\nAll of you, you recognize we\u2019re in very good hands with the Vice President. (Applause.) And I\u2019d like to offer you the opportunity to just offer us some closing remarks as we \u2014 as we leave this \u2014 this great conversation.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I want to talk about the EPA Administrator. (Laughter.) I do.\n\n\n\nAs he has said, we have traveled the country together. We have had many, many, many conversations. And it really does matter who the leaders are at these moments and sitting in these chairs. And, in Michael Regan, we have somebody who really gets it, who cares about it, and who is not only enthusiastic but you really are a fighter.\n\n\n\nAs kind as he is, he also does not tolerate any kind of stuff. (Laughter and applause.) And meaning \u2014 meaning \u2014 meaning \u2014 meaning he does not \u2014 he has no patience for bureaucracy. He has no patience for anything that is short of actually implementing and seeing things through.\n\n\n\nHe is bold. And one of the things I admire about you is that you don\u2019t put up your finger and think, \u201cOkay, where are the political winds going?\u201d You really are focused on doing the right thing. And we know over the history of the \u2014 of the EPA\u2019s being that it has the capacity to be very bold, but it will be a function of who sits in that chair.\n\n\n\nAnd you have done an extraordinary job. And I don\u2019t get a chance to say that to you hardly ever and certainly not in front of colleagues. And so, I want to do that now, because it\u2019s hard work.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019ll just end with this. In spite of all of our optimism for this moment, we are still working against status quo.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Yes. Yes, we are.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And the thing about status quo is that I think people sometimes are not clear about it. And they think status quo means it\u2019s static. Oh no, status quo is quite dynamic. It will fight against change. It will push against change.\n\n\n\nSo, to be in this position and do the work you do requires a lot of good stuff and perseverance and dedication. And so, I\u2019d like to end my comments by thanking you, Administrator, for your work.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Wow.\n\n\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATOR REGAN: Thank you. Thank you.\n\n\n\nEND 3:07 P.M. EST",

Meanwhile, the three cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) continued their space physics and Earth imagery work and also maintained orbital lab systems.\n\nNASA Flight Engineers Josh Cassada and Frank Rubio are cleaning up biology research hardware and finalizing sample processing after three full days of bone healing research. The duo worked inside the Kibo laboratory module servicing the samples and then stowing them into science freezers. Those samples will be packed on a future SpaceX Dragon cargo mission for return and then analyzed and compared to control samples in laboratories on Earth. The two astronauts also cleaned Kibo\u2019s Life Science Glovebox and its components where the intensive bone investigation work took place this week.\n\nCassada also worked on space agriculture on Thursday, collecting leaves from thale cress plants housed inside the Advanced Plant Habitat for stowage and analysis on Earth. He later tended to tomato plants growing inside the Veggie space botany facility for the Veg-05 experiment. Both studies are taking place inside the Columbus laboratory module.\n\nJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Koichi Wakata explored ways to enable on-demand production of nutrients for astronauts on long-term missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The technology demonstration uses engineered microbes, or yeast, to ensure a safe and simple food production environment in space and offset the degradation of nutrients stowed over long periods.\n\nThe next spacewalk to continue upgrading the orbiting lab\u2019s power generation system is planned for February 2. Two spacewalkers will exit the Quest airlock in their Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs), or spacesuits, to finish installing a modification kit on the starboard truss structure. The hardware installation job will ready the space station for its next roll-out solar array. Ahead of the upcoming spacewalk, spacesuit gloves and tethers were inspected.\n\nCommander Sergey Prokopyev continued more space physics experiment runs on Thursday as he explored how clouds of highly charged particles, or plasma crystals, behave in microgravity. Flight Engineer Dmitri Petelin of Roscosmos spent his day on life support maintenance before partnering with fellow cosmonaut Anna Kikina for ultrasound eye scans. Kikina resumed her Earth observations using ultraviolet imaging hardware to obtain a map of the nighttime glow of Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",

            "text": "The coming decades of space exploration will see astronauts return to the Moon, the first crewed missions to Mars, and robotic missions to the outer Solar System (among other things). These missions will leverage innovative technologies that allow faster transits, long-duration stays, and sustainable living far from Earth. To this end, NASA and other space agencies are investigating nuclear applications, especially where energy and propulsion are concerned. Many of these proposals have been on the books since the early space age and have been thoroughly validated.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 24th, NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced they were launching an interagency agreement to develop a nuclear-thermal propulsion (NTP) concept. The proposed nuclear rocket is known as the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO), which would enable fast-transit missions to Mars (weeks instead of months). This three-phase program will culminate with a demonstration of the DRACO in orbit, which is expected to occur by early 2027.\n\nSince the early Space Age, NASA and other space agencies have considered multiple proposals for nuclear spacecraft. These can be grouped into two categories: nuclear thermal and nuclear-electric propulsion (NTP/NEP). For NTP, a nuclear reactor heats deuterium or tritium propellent (hydrogen-2 or -3) to create plasma, which is then channeled through nozzles to generate thrust. In a NEP rocket, a reactor powers a Hall-Effect thruster that ionizes inert gas (like xenon) and accelerates it to generate thrust. Whereas NEP offers higher specific impulse (Isp), or longer periods of thrust, NTP delivers greater thrust.\n\nArtist\u2019s concept of a Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Rocket in Low Earth Orbit. Credit: NASA\n\nSeveral proposals for NTP systems have been made in recent years that could reduce transit times to Mars to less than 100 days \u2013 some as little as 45 days! Having faster, more efficient transportation technology is critical for crewed missions to Mars and is consistent with NASA\u2019s Moon to Mars Objectives. Using conventional rockets, traveling to Mars would take six to nine months, and the missions can only launch every 26 months (coinciding with a Mars Opposition). During these transits, astronauts will be exposed to elevated levels of solar and cosmic radiation.\n\nThey will also be spending the entire period in microgravity, which takes a serious toll on human physiology. Lastly, longer trips require more supplies and storage space, which is limited aboard the Orion spacecraft, which acts as a command room, dormitory, and dining hall for its crew. A more powerful propulsion system enables larger spacecraft that can accommodate larger scientific payloads and provide more power for instrumentation and communication. As Administrator Bill Nelson said in a recent NASA press release:\n\n\u201cNASA will work with our long-term partner, DARPA, to develop and demonstrate advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology as soon as 2027. With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever \u2013 a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars. Congratulations to both NASA and DARPA on this exciting investment, as we ignite the future, together.\u201d\n\nPer the agreement, NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) will lead the technical development of the nuclear thermal engine, which will be integrated with the DARPA-built spacecraft. DARPA will lead the overall program as the contracting authority, overseeing rocket systems integration and procurement, approvals, scheduling, and other considerations. NASA and DARPA will collaborate on the assembly of the engine before the in-space demonstration as early as 2027. Said DARPA director Dr. Stefanie Tompkins:\n\n\u201cDARPA and NASA have a long history of fruitful collaboration in advancing technologies for our respective goals, from the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the Moon for the first time to robotic servicing and refueling of satellites. The space domain is critical to modern commerce, scientific discovery, and national security. The ability to accomplish leap-ahead advances in space technology through the DRACO nuclear thermal rocket program will be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting material to the Moon and eventually, people to Mars.\u201d\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of four KRUSTY generators providing power to an outpost on the surface of Mars. Credit: NASA/STMD\n\nFor NASA, previous efforts to develop nuclear technologies for space exploration include the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA), which was tested successfully in 1964 and 1969. Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) have been tested in space since 1961 and were part of the Apollo missions\u2019 surface experiments. Since then, Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTG) have powered robotic probes like the Viking, Voyager, Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons missions, and the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers.\n\nNASA, the Department of Energy (DOE), and commercial-industrial partners are also working to realize nuclear technologies for multiple mission profiles. This includes NASA\u2019s Fission Surface Power project, which expands on its Kilopower Reactor Using Sterling TechnologY (KRUSTY) project to develop nuclear reactors that could power long-duration missions on the Moon, Mars, and beyond. In June, NASA and the DOE awarded three commercial design efforts to develop nuclear power plant concepts that could be used on the surface of the Moon and, later, Mars.\n\nThis year, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program awarded Phase I contracts to multiple proposed nuclear technologies. These include a hybrid fusion/fast-fission reactor that would power a mission to Europa, a nuclear-thermal engine that could allow for missions to Mars in just 45 days, and a miniature nuclear battery that could enable CubeSat missions to the outer Solar System. Said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for STMD.\n\n\u201cWith this collaboration, we will leverage our expertise gained from many previous space nuclear power and propulsion projects. Recent aerospace materials and engineering advancements are enabling a new era for space nuclear technology, and this flight demonstration will be a major achievement toward establishing a space transportation capability for an Earth-Moon economy.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading: NASA",

            "text": "Newly launched Milwaukee startup Aeroplicity Inc. has created a blockchain-based aerospace and defense platform geared toward small and medium-sized businesses. The company\u2019s \u201cTraceability\u201d application allows businesses to create digital twins of their documents, which can be shared through QR codes, eliminating the need for physical copies. The use of blockchain technology ensures the authenticity of the documentation and improves supply chain transparency, speed and efficiency, the company says. Jerome Miastkowski, founder and chief executive officer of Aeroplicity, said the requirement to conduct business as an aerospace and defense supplier is becoming increasingly complex. Mandates are being passed down from the government to Tier 1 suppliers in the aerospace and defense space. This in turn trickles down and affects smaller manufacturers and suppliers within the supply chain. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to implement (these mandates) without a product like ours,\u201d Miastkowski said. \u201cThere\u2019s all of these quality controls. There\u2019s this entire set of requirements happening on the security side for data. That ties into this other side and now it\u2019s starting to be funneling into the lower levels of the supply chain.\u201d Miastkowski earned his aerospace engineering degree from Iowa State University. After selling his company CertifyNation, an aviation and aerospace component manufacturer, to Sussex-based The Angelus Corp. in 2016, Miastkowski moved to Wisconsin. He worked there for the past six years as part of the terms of the acquisition, and eventually took over IT for the company. This is when he began to notice the increasingly stringent mandates being passed down through the industry. These requirements can put smaller suppliers and manufacturers at a disadvantage as they do not have the time and resources that a Tier 1 supplier might. With Traceability, users can conduct business as usual and meet the complex requirements of the aerospace and defense industry. \u201cThis system would allow someone to literally transact on it along with some internal policies and say they\u2019re fully compliant outside of their current systems,\u201d Miastkowski said. When you upload a document to the Traceability application, it is then written within a blockchain network. This allows users to verify that a document is authentic. \u201cWhen you send that in the system to someone else, they know that it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Miastkowski said. Aeroplicity is designed to improve supply chain transparency, speed, and efficiency, making it easier for businesses to ensure compliance with aerospace and defense regulations and standards. With the Traceability (as a service) application, businesses can easily access, share, and request documentation in real-time, reducing the risk of errors and increasing the speed of transactions. The blockchain-backed platform provides a secure and immutable record of documentation, providing an added layer of security and trust for businesses in the aerospace and defense industry. \u201cWhen you use a system like Aeroplicity, you (can) attach a QR code to your shipment and there are hundreds of documents your customers can access versus you having to print all of this,\u201d Miastkowski said. Now that Aeroplicity has officially launched, Miastkowski\u2019s number one priority for the startup is earning sales. He\u2019s planning on opening up a funding round in the near future. \u201cMy goal for Aeroplicity is that a small or medium-sized business can literally run their aerospace and defense operations and comply with everything across the board by just being on it,\u201d Miastkowski said. \u201cThe big companies design all this stuff in house but don\u2019t give anyone else access to it for their own use.\u201d",

            "text": "Perovskites are of interest in space applications because they are a lower-cost and lightweight option to other technologies, and they have the potential to achieve efficiencies similar to those of current space technologies. In space applications, however, perovskites would be exposed to protons, alpha particles, atomic oxygen and other stressors. The NREL research is the latest effort to determine how perovskites can meet these challenges.\n\nThe biggest challenges on Earth are related to weather, but in space perovskites must address the problems that come from radiation bombardment and extreme temperature swings. Perovskites show signs of tolerating radiation better than many other solar cells, but more testing is needed in that area.\n\nResearchers last year ran simulations to demonstrate how exposure to radiation in space would affect perovskites. The scientists determined that perovskites would work in space, but would need to be encapsulated in some way for protection against the elements. would work in space but pointed out the need to encapsulate the cell in some way to provide added protection.\n\nIn the follow-up research they found that a micron-thick layer of silicon oxide, about 100 times thinner than a typical human hair, might be all that is needed. Ahmad Kirmani, lead author of the latest Nature Energy paper, said the silicon oxide layer could reduce the weight of conventional radiation barriers used for other solar cells by more than 99% and serves as a first step toward designing lightweight and low-cost packaging for perovskites.\n\nWhile high-energy protons travel through perovskites without causing harm, low-energy protons are more abundant and damaging. The researchers found that the silicon oxide layer protected the perovskite from damage by low-energy protons.\n\n\u201cWe thought it would be impossible for the silicon oxide to provide protection against fully penetrating long-range particles such as the high-energy protons and alpha particles,\u201d Kirmani said. \u201cHowever, the oxide layer turned out to be a surprisingly good barrier against those as well.\u201d\n\nUnprotected perovskite solar cells were found to lose only about 15% of their initial efficiency when exposed to low-energy protons, and a larger concentration of particles destroyed the cells. The perovskites, however, demonstrated what the scientists described as \u201ca remarkable resilience.\u201d With the simple barrier, the cells showed no damage.\n\nThe team made up of researchers from NREL, University of North Texas and the University of Oklahoma, demonstrated that a silicon oxide layer can harden perovskite photovoltaics against critical space stressors. They found that a 1-\u03bcm-thick silicon oxide layer evaporated atop the device can block protons without a loss in power conversion efficiency, which results in a device lifetime increase in low Earth orbit by 20x and in highly elliptical orbit by 30x. They also found that silicon-oxide-protected cells will survive water submersion, and were found to retain power conversion efficiencies on exposure to alpha irradiation and atomic oxygen.\n\nIn addition to making the cells more resilient in space, the researchers also tested how the barrier could protect against an uncontrolled moisture and temperature environment for several days to mimic storage conditions. The protected cells retained their initial 19% efficiency, while the unprotected cells showed significant degradation, from 19.4% to 10.8%. The oxide layer also provided protection when exposed to water.\n\nThe researchers further subjected perovskite solar cells to bombardment by ultraviolet photons, similar to the environment in low-Earth orbit. The unprotected cells were destroyed after eight minutes, but the protected cells retained their initial efficiency after 20 minutes and only had a slight drop after 30 minutes.\n\nThrough the simulations and experiments, the researchers found that by reducing the damage from radiation, the lifetime of the protected solar cells used in Earth\u2019s orbits and deep space would be increased from months to years. With the protective layer of silicon oxide, perovskites could be used for space as well as terrestrial applications.\n\nFunded by the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), the NREL research was done for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) with the aim of developing low-cost innovative energy sources that can power the armed forces worldwide.",

Michael \u201cPeewee\u201d Sherman Space Security and International Partnerships: Ron Caton\n\nMaj. Gen. Heather Pringle announced new space mission area leads, or MAL, in December 2022. With the growing national space community, she said, adding space MALs will help support the range of customers in the expanding ecosystem.\u201cThe team will build a critical communication path with the Space Force, and I am certain they will add considerable value,\u201d Pringle said.In ensuring AFRL\u2019s support of the U.S. Space Force, Pringle began \u201cOne Lab, Two Services\u201d as one of her top priorities.Along with naming new space MALs, Pringle also established a key role: deputy technology executive officer, or TEO, for Space Science and Technology, or S&T.Dr. Andrew \u201cAndy\u201d Williams, deputy TEO for S&T, is responsible for integrating and executing Space S&T across AFRL and the community to ensure the appropriate prioritization of Space S&T needs for a balanced technology portfolio to support the Space Force.The deputy TEO role within AFRL was established with the standup of the Space Force.\u201cWe wanted to make sure there was a leadership role within AFRL focused on capturing the needs and the requirements from the Space Force, and to ensure their needs and equities were being addressed,\u201d Williams said.The space MALs will focus on customer engagement with external stakeholders and translating between operational capability gaps and S&T solutions to ensure strong communication, Williams said. The MALs will also aid the enterprise planning process to integrate space S&T across the mission organizations to enhance one AFRL supporting two services.\u201cThe five new space MALs will assist me with integrating technical capabilities across the AFRL enterprise to provide the USSF with the necessary technology to deter our adversaries in space,\u201d Williams said.Five mission area leads were created and are aligned to the Space Force, or \u201cSpacepower\u201d, doctrine to ensure AFRL is aligned with the primary customer \u2014 the Space Force, he added.Of theareas, the first lead is focused on, which involves sensing, communication, positioning, navigation and timing, Williams said. Thearea is, including launch, in-space propulsion, and potentially servicing future spacecraft and Space Force applications, he added. Thearea isTo understand what is going on in space, what our systems are doing, what everyone else's systems are doing \u2014 and making sure that we truly understand what is going on in space,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo that we can respond appropriately.\u201dThearea is. This is how the team will make the space systems and architectures more resilient. Such as \u201cthe hybrid architecture, using proliferation of satellites and low Earth orbits; these are all things that we are looking to do within space superiority.\u201dThearea involves. The MAL will look at how to interact and integrate with commercial and international partners.There is \u201cthe realization that space isn't just about the U.S. government,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere are strong elements for commercial involvement and relationships with our international partners.\u201dThe focus of the space mission area leads is, Williams said.is to make sure that we have anacross AFRL \u2014 leveraging all of the capabilities that we have across the different mission organizations and technology areas,\u201d he added.Many of the technologies are space focused, but not all. There are many considered multidomain or domain agnostic, Williams said. This includes cyber, networking and other similar applications.\u201cIt doesn't matter whether you're in the air or space \u2014 the fundamental research is the same for many technologies, and we need to leverage all capabilities across AFRL in support of one lab two services,\u201d he saidThearea of focus for the MALs involves, interacting with groups external to the AFRL and then translating operational language to technical requirements and back to work with customers.As the Director of Science, Technology and Research for the U.S. Space Force, Dr. Joel B. Mozer translates the goals, objectives and strategies of the Chief of Space Operations into actionable and prioritized demand signals for the S&T ecosystem.\u201cThe mission area leads are the primary recipients of those demand signals at AFRL, as they further [develop] that information into funded programs and objectives at the labs,\u201d Mozer said. \u201cThe mission area leads are also key communicators of the discoveries, innovative ideas, and \u2018technology push\u2019 that comes from the laboratories.\u201dWilliams said much of their communication has to do with the language that the subject matter experts, or SMEs, speak. He compared it to the purchase of a new TV, where the operator or consumer may simply want quality sound and image vs the scientist who wants to know the definition between 4K and 8K and how many pixels and the pixel density.So, from operator to scientist, the MALs help understand the needs and translate these to a technical language, so the SMEs understand what they are working.\u201cThey are the focal points internally for our subject matter experts to understand what the needs and the priorities of the Space Force are,\u201d Williams added. \u201cWe also want them to be our link to industry, commercial, academia and anybody we want to collaborate with.\u201dIt is the mission of the MALs to know the priorities, capability gaps and pain points for the operators, Williams said. Then they must be able to communicate that to the AFRL enterprise. This translation will allow them to prioritize the S&T needed to develop and deliver those capabilities.The MALs are integrated across AFRL with two MALs in the Space Vehicles Directorate, one from the Directed Energy Directorate, one from the Aerospace Systems Directorate and a fifth at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\n\u201cThe MALs demonstrate the diversity of space research across AFRL \u2014 all five of the MALs come from different parts of the organization,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\n\nThe MALs are integrating and starting to work together as a group. With only a few months on the job, the team gathered to discuss plans and goals they want to achieve by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nGetting to an integrated enterprise strategy is one of the goals, Williams said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe two goals are to document the integrated space technology strategy so that we know exactly what capability we will deliver in the near term,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd to ensure we have a full capability pipeline for the continual flow of new technologies into operator capability.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe second goal is to strengthen S&T communication across the Space Force.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith many new organizations, new roles and responsibilities emerging, we are trying to keep pace with the USSF,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe want to make sure we have constant communication and know what those linkages are and where those demand signals are.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs the MALs become established, Mozer believes there will be an increase in communication and collaboration, which are the keys to effective S&T management.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must be foresighted, flexible and fast if we want to keep up with our strategic competitors in space,\u201d Mozer said.\n\n\n\nKey components, expanding areas\n\n\n\nKeeping up with the ever-changing technology is an area of importance and the space domain is the most technologically challenging warfighting domain, Mozer said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is also the fastest-growing domain today in terms of technology, human activity and dependence on services from space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAnother key component is digital transformation.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpace Force wants to be born digital and we are really focused on that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe want to make sure that the tools and the processes that we are developing in AFRL integrate with those in the Space Force, so we can work seamlessly as an enterprise and as different organizations to really accelerate the delivery of capability.\u201d\n\n\n\nWilliams said the team will work toward digital models of the systems and the technology developed to transition that to Space Systems Command so the process to develop those into deliverable capabilities can be accelerated.\n\n\n\nWilliams said he will be expanding four major focus areas within the AFRL portfolio.\n\n\n\nThe first is the hybrid architecture and how to accelerate the pivot to that hybrid architecture, which is focused on resiliency, he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cOrbital diversity, platform diversity and making sure that we have resilient capabilities because of the importance of space to the joint fight,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\n\nAnd the second is emerging technologies such as quantum, autonomy, machine intelligence, machine learning and leveraging the capabilities, in an ethical way, to improve capabilities and reduce the burdens on operators in the Space Force, Williams said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe third big area is looking at how we can integrate better with the Space Force, and how we can move to agile capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have examples with our agile software development efforts at Catalyst Campus and the stand-up of the 15th Space Surveillance Squadron [or 15 SPSS] as a blended squadron between Space Operations Command [or SpOC] and AFRL. How do we apply that to other areas including hardware development as a focus area?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 15 SPSS is the blended squadron in Maui, Hawaii, and is unique as it fuses Space Domain Awareness Operations and SDA Research and Development. And the Catalyst Campus is an effort in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Williams said, it is used for agile software development in support of SpOC using DevSecOps software approaches.\n\n\n\nWilliams said they are looking to improve integration across all the major functions.\n\n\n\nThe fourth area is related to space logistics. Williams said they will be asking and answering questions such as: \u201chow we can service satellites, how we can do upgrade of satellites, what does that capability mean? How do we partner with commercial to increase that capability and what can we achieve? Once we have the capability on orbit, how can we service and upgrade it to make sure that we either maintain or enhance the capability of those systems?\u201d\n\n\n\nThese questions are related to the national strategy that was released in-space servicing assembly and manufacturing, or ISAM, Williams added.\n\n\n\nCritical importance, external stakeholders\n\n\n\nMaintaining and accelerating the technology advantage is of critical importance for AFRL and the technologies developed across the department.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we address challenges associated with the proliferation of technology in a highly competitive environment, it becomes even more critical that the Department of the Air Force keeps its technological edge,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd AFRL is the pointy end of the technology spear to make sure that it happens.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe MALs are keenly aware of the challenges and capabilities necessary. They are tasked with finding the most efficient route to getting the capabilities into the field and in the operators\u2019 hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, to maintain that technical advantage, it's critical that we maintain that S&T pipeline, from basic research all the way to advanced capabilities and prototyping, and then delivering that to the acquisition communities,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou can then provide the critical capabilities to the warfighter, and AFRL has a role in almost that entire pipeline.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the primary roles of the space mission area leads is to ensure communication with all field commands to rapidly transition the technology to Space Systems Command, Williams added. This will lead to a better understanding of the pain points for the operators at Space Operations Command and to provide support for Space Training and Readiness Command as new technologies transition.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you've ever received a new device, there's a learning curve as to how you actually use that,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cAnd similarly, we have to make sure operators know how use the new technologies we are delivering to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbout AFRL\n\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory is the primary scientific research and development center for the Department of the Air Force. AFRL plays an integral role in leading the discovery, development, and integration of affordable warfighting technologies for our air, space and cyberspace force. With a workforce of more than 11,500 across nine technology areas and 40 other operations across the globe, AFRL provides a diverse portfolio of science and technology ranging from fundamental to advanced research and technology development.

And while they\u2019ve been delivering technology to the industrial space for years now via their Amazon Web Services cloud storage and analytics products, few people would consider them an industrial technology supplier. After all, their cloud services for the industrial manufacturing space have largely been extensions of the cloud services they offer to every industry sector.\n\nBut that started changing late last year when Amazon Web Services, typically referred to as AWS, began offering its AWS Supply Chain application. Features of this cloud-based software are based on nearly 30 years of Amazon.com logistics network experience. For example, the unified data lake feature of AWS Supply Chain uses machine learning models pre-trained for supply chains to understand, extract, and transform disparate data into a unified data model. AWS says the data lake can process data from a variety of data sources, including existing ERP and supply chain management systems.\n\nCompanies already using AWS Supply Chain include Traeger Grills and Lifetime Brands, the supplier of home goods by brands such as Farberware and KitchenAid.\n\nAnother feature of AWS Supply Chain is its Insights module for information on potential supply chain risks\u2014such as overstock or stock outs. When such risks are detected, the software automatically evaluates rebalancing options to provide recommended actions.\n\nAnd the Demand Planning feature of AWS Supply Chain reportedly adjusts to market conditions and allows for collaboration across teams to avoid excess inventory costs and waste. As with the unified data lake component, this module of AWS Supply Chain also uses machine learning. Here it\u2019s used to analyze historical and real time sales and production data to create forecasts and adjust models to improve accuracy.\n\nWhile this supply chain app is definitely an interesting foray into the industrial space for AWS, the product makes sense considering that Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world. But AWS isn\u2019t stopping with its supply chain offering. They\u2019re also venturing into predictive maintenance systems that include sensors and gateways for delivering sensor data to the cloud for analysis.\n\nThis AWS product is called Monitron. According to Amazon, Monitron\u2019s wireless sensors attach to equipment with adhesive and are purpose-built to capture vibration and temperature data.\n\nUp to 20 Monitron sensors can be connected at a time to one gateway, depending on the distance between the gateway and the sensor.\n\nAmazon says Monitron automatically detects abnormal machine operating states by analyzing vibration and temperature signals using ISO standards for vibration as well as machine learning-enabled models. Key applications include monitoring use of fans, bearings, compressors, motors, gearboxes, and pumps.\n\nPush notifications are sent to users whenever the service detects abnormal vibration or temperature patterns. These patterns can be reviewed and tracked by users within the app. And user feedback on alerts, such as details around the cause of the failure and actions taken, can be entered into the Monitron system, which learns from that feedback as well as the real-time data it collects to continually improve over time using its machine learning technology.\n\nSo I hope you enjoyed this Technology Matters episode. And, as always, you can find many more insights into automation technology at automationworld.com.",

A sail area of 3.6 square meters was autonomous deployed from an impressively small packing size of 10 x 10 x 10 cm to demonstrate deorbiting satellite technology.\n\nWe want to establish a zero debris policy, which means if you bring a spacecraft into orbit you have to remove it. Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director General\n\nADEO-N2 Deployment in Orbit ADEO\u2019s deployment was captured in front of the \u2018eyes\u2019 of the integrated camera onboard the ION satellite carrier, as ADEO unfurled showing its \u201cwings\u2019, and immediately initiated the satellite\u2019s descent - known as deorbiting. The image shows one edge of the sail - a large aluminium-coated polyamide membrane attached to four carbon-fibre reinforced booms, following its jack-in-a-box deployment. The sail provides a passive method of deorbiting by increasing the atmospheric surface drag effect and causing an accelerated decay in the satellite\u2019s orbital altitude. The satellite will eventually burn-up in the atmosphere, providing a quicker residue-free method of disposal. ADEO gently pushes the ION satellite carrier, as if it\u2019s on \u201cangel wings\u201d, out of its orbit and towards Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nAnimated depiction of a spacecraft deploying a drag sail in orbit Adeptly named \u201cShow Me Your Wings\u201d the ADEO-mission is the final in-flight qualification test needed to provide the technological proof-of-concept. A smaller 2.5 square meter sail was fitted onto the upper stage of the Electron launch vehicle \u201cIts Business Time\u201d mission in 2018 and several parabolic flights were performed from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe ADEO test model is the smallest variation of the ADEO product family, designed especially for the de-orbit of small satellites in the 1-100 kg class range. The approach is however scalable for medium and large size satellites. Multiple units, on one satellite or an upper stage is also option, if the accommodation of a larger sail is unfeasible. Tailor-made solutions depend on the initial orbit, satellite mass and required de-orbiting time. The largest variation can be as big as 100 square meters and take up to 45 mins to deploy. The smallest sail is just 3.5 square meters and deploy in just 0.8 seconds!\n\nADEO technology provides a safe, robust and sustainable method of passively de-orbiting small satellites. Passive methods of deorbiting are advantageous in eliminating the need for active steering, with no additional GNS or propulsion subsystem. The system can be designed for passive attitude stabilisation and the approach is applicable for non-operational and tumbling satellites Reliably removing satellites as they approach their system end-of-life, or satellites that have become unresponsive, is a key aspect in ESA\u2019s ESA\u2019s Zero Debris Initiative. Valuable orbits become available for use and the probability of unwanted collision decreases \u2013 which would only create the next generation of space debris. The activity, funded by GSTP, was implemented by HPS GmbH (Germany) and its subsidiary in Romania.",
