            "text": "Multiple engineering experiments are currently underway, or poised to begin, at a cabinet on China's space station which is in a near-Earth orbit. These experiments aim to acquire know-how that can support more experimental possibilities and human survival in outer space.\n\nThe Space Basic Experiment Cabinet mounted on the country's space lab module Mengtian is carrying its first group of five experiments on space technology, figuring out how to resist microbes that may eat away spacecraft metals, produce oxygen from algae in space, and convert heat energy into electricity.\n\nMicrobes and algae\n\nOne of the drawers installed onto the cabinet is the microbial resistance facility. Microbes tend to have significant corrosive influence on materials in a confined space module, which makes effective in-orbit management of them crucial for any long-term space presence.\n\nThe facility in a detachable box is projected to complete the first high-throughput microbial resistance experiment in the world, in which the microbial growth will be actively controlled in microgravity before implementing PCR testing and subsequent quarantine and disinfection.\n\nThe first microbe being tested is fungus Aspergillus niger, a type of mildew that may corrode the copper and aluminum alloy.\n\nThe box will be used as a key biological safety platform for scientific research and technical identification in the space station, according to the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST).\n\nAside from potential hazards, the biological chemistry in space can also be utilized to produce fundamental elements for human survival. An algae cultivation test in the cabinet is designed to examine how efficiently the water plant can generate oxygen and how to cook it on site.\n\nMicroalgae is a primary producer on Earth that makes the planet oxygen-rich and it is believed to be highly tolerant to zero-gravity and cosmic radiation. Also, some kinds of it are capable of synthesizing protein, fatty acid, and sugar-like nutrients to offer safe food supplements for astronauts.\n\nIn Mengtian, the algae will be cultivated in both solid and liquid culture and then the liquid-supported algae will be heated in a \"microwave oven.\"\n\nThis is a significant attempt that may lay a foundation for extended space travel and long-term human habitation in the future, said the CAST.\n\nPower and metals\n\nA pilot engine called Stirling thermoelectric convertor has also been put on the experimental rack. The heat-to-electricity conversion tech involves two pistons in a cylinder moving at high frequency, which can convert thermal energy to electricity with relatively high efficiency and power density.\n\nChinese engineers are trying to verify the feasibility and stability of it in orbit, so as to provide clues for developing advanced power technology in space that can be used in future deep-space exploration.\n\nAnother experiment in the cabinet may tell material scientists how to utilize the liquid metal in space.\n\nThe alloyed metals like those gallium-based and bismuth-based ones can flow at normal temperature or slightly higher than that. They exhibit several desirable properties including good conductivity, high boiling points and good capacity for heat transmission.\n\nSuch an experiment on Mengtian will verify the liquid metal's performance in rapid melting, electromagnetic drive, sealing and inflation protection, which may help give birth to emerging and disruptive technologies, according to the CAST.\n\nThe last of the five experiments is set to evaluate the hazards of chippings produced by a device based on friction between electric brushes and slip rings. The device is used for power and signal transfer in solar array drive assembly and spacecraft altitude control gyroscope.\n\nHowever, it's still unknown how those rubbing fragments floating in the capsule will affect space work -- how those granules move or whether they will cluster in microgravity.\n\nThe test is designed to take pictures of their real motions to lay a foundation for an optimized device that can ensure long-duration operation of spacecraft, according to the CAST.",

Webster leads an AFRL team that develops novel space sensor technologies for the nation\u2019s infrared surveillance, missile warning and tracking, weather monitoring and other systems. Metcalf serves as the AFRL space mission area lead in the Office of the Deputy Technology Executive Officer for Space Science and Technology. Courtesy/AFRL\n\nAFRL News:\n\nKAFB \u2014 The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), recently announced that engineers Dr. Andrew J. \u201cAJ\u201d Metcalf and Dr. Preston T. Webster are the U.S. Air Force nominees for the 74th Annual Arthur S. Flemming Award.\n\nThe nominees are among hundreds of scientists and engineers at AFRL\u2019s Space Vehicles Directorate located on Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nEstablished in 1948, the Flemming Award honors federal employees with 3-15 years of service who have been nominated by their federal agencies, selected through a competitive judging process and have made significant contributions to the federal government. Winners are selected from across the federal government in three categories \u2014 basic science; applied science, engineering and mathematics; and managerial or legal achievement.\n\nAFRL Commander Maj. Gen. Heather Pringle, in her announcement to the workforce, congratulated Metcalf and Webster and said, \u201cBeing an Air Force-level nominee is a huge deal and these outstanding individuals have proven why they were selected.\u201d\n\nU.S. Space Force, or USSF, member Metcalf was recognized for his accomplishments in the category of applied science, engineering and mathematics. The Madison, Wisconsin, native has been with AFRL for five years. He is the AFRL space mission area lead in the Office of the Deputy Technology Executive Officer for Space Science and Technology \u2014 an office under the direct authority of Pringle, who in addition to being the AFRL commander, serves as the Department of the Air Force\u2019s chief technology executive officer.\n\nMetcalf is responsible for a $2.3 billion space technology portfolio that reaches across the AFRL enterprise. In addition, he manages five other space mission area leads who interface with external stakeholders and are responsible for customer engagement and bringing awareness of programs throughout AFRL and the national space community.\n\n\u201cI am extremely appreciative of my colleagues and leadership for providing the opportunities to advance critical space research that supports the next generation of Space Force operators,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cI cherish the flexibility I have had as an AFRL scientist in work that encompasses bench-level scientist, principal investigator, program manager, and various strategic leadership roles across the space enterprise.\u201d\n\nMetcalf said his responsibilities include five space flight experiments totaling $341 million and three ground demonstrations valued at $61 million.\n\n\u201cThese state-of-the-art technologies are providing solutions that address top priorities for several of our country\u2019s preeminent strategic systems,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cThey include ICBMs in support of nuclear deterrence, communications and the global positioning system, a service the USSF provides free of charge across the globe.\u201d\n\nWebster, nominated in the basic science category, hails from Bloomfield, Iowa and joined AFRL in 2018. He leads a research team that develops novel space sensor technologies for the nation\u2019s infrared surveillance, missile warning and tracking, weather monitoring and various other systems.

The nation plans to launch more than 200 spacecraft with nearly 70 space missions this year, according to a blue paper concluding that last year's achievement and outlining this year's plan published by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The record-breaking plan could move China to further strengthen its capability in space technology innovation and space exploration. The ambitious plan indicates China's space projects enters a post-COVID-19 era. The pandemic brought hiccups to some programs and the threat of the virus hampered the communications process and supply chain, Wang Xiaojun, head of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) told an international forum in 2021. With the threat of COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, Chinese scientists also plan to launch two manned missions and one or two cargo spacecraft every year to the China Space Station (CSS), according to China Manned Space Agency on Wednesday. After its construction completed in the end of 2022, the space station entered the phase of application and development this year, which is expected to last more than a decade. The Long March carrier rocket series is also expected to exceed 500 launches cumulatively this year since they began service in 1970. China's space development leapfrogged in the past decade with the successful assembly of every new spacecraft, said Jiang Xu, who works at the assembly and environmental engineering department of China Academy of Space Technology. \"Behind each spacecraft, it's a slew of key technological breakthroughs and more reliable and advanced homegrown components.\"\n\nCSS in first year operation Embracing its first-year operation after full construction, the space station will witness multiple missions taking place. In May, the Tianzhou-6 cargo spacecraft will be launched to dock at the rear port of the core module of CSS, which forms into a combination of three modules and two spacecraft. The mission will replenish the daily supply, component supply for maintenance, mission payload samples and propellant. In the same month, the Shenzhou-16 manned mission will be carried out. The spacecraft will dock with the radial port of the core module and the assembly will be a combination of three modules and three spacecraft. In October, the Shenzhou-17 manned mission is scheduled to blast off and dock at the front port of the core module. Shenzhou-15 and 16 crews will have multiple spacewalks this year. For the first time, \"We will see man and cargo go extravehicular together at the same time,\" said Jing Zheng, deputy chief commander of CSS general system in an interview with CGTN. In addition, the two robotic arms attached to the space station will help support payload installation for the first time. The space station system will not only support the assembly, but also support the ground support system containing a digital CSS and expansion plans as well, according to Jing.",

            "text": "The Global Space and Technology Convention (GSTC) kicked off with over 800 thought leaders, industry insiders and investors across some 40 countries and regions \u2013 marking one of the largest industry events this year.\n\nHeld annually since 2008 by Singapore Space and Technology Limited (SSTL), GSTC is into its 15th edition, bringing together an ecosystem of high-level panel discussions on the most current industry issues, networking sessions to accelerate business-matching, and technical industry workshops.\n\nThis year, space for economic expansion, experimentation across various sectors including life sciences, and the rise of space entrepreneurship are in sharp focus as Asia\u2019s space industry rises to the fore on the global stage.\n\nThe global space industry grew by 8 per cent in 2022 and is expected to reach over US$737 billion within a decade, according to latest industry reports. Asia currently corners US$102 billion of a total global market value of US$417 billion, and is the second-largest region after North America.\n\nAgainst this optimistic backdrop of high-momentum growth, GSTC 2023 is announcing a variety of initiatives that will accelerate the space industry in Asia, better connect the region to the world and build Singapore as an influential space hub.\n\n\u201cSpace as a critical economic pillar for the future has gained tremendous momentum in recent years. This year, the space growth story is accelerating at the speed of light with Singapore taking its place as a growing space hub, and space becoming increasingly ubiquitous across other industries. This is the New\n\nSpace movement on speed \u2013 with the space sector becoming more mainstream and integral to life on Earth. This movement is 16 years in the making since SSTL\u2019s inception in 2007 and the very first GSTC in 2008,\u201d said Jonathan Hung, Executive Chairman, SSTL.\n\nLeading Economic Expansion, Building Singapore\u2019s Space Hub with Established and Emerging Space Economies\n\nSingapore is fast-building its status as a space hub, buoyed by a series of significant MoUs that SSTL is signing with leading and emerging space economies \u2013 the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland.\n\nSSTL signed an MoU with the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) at last year\u2019s GSTC to facilitate a two-way deal flow of investment and trade between Singapore and UK-based space tech startups. A year on, the collaboration has led to reciprocal Singapore and UK delegations on collaboration opportunities.\n\nChief among the achievements is a partnership between SSTL and In-Space Missions to organise Asia Pacific\u2019s dedicated rideshare mission to help more companies and research institutes in the region to test their payloads in space and gain space heritage in a quicker, more affordable manner.\n\nAnother achievement is award-winning Singapore startup Navigate Commodities entering a globally exclusive partnership with renowned UK Earth Observation heavyweight Earth-i, in association with the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop real-time daily monitoring services for the steel smelting industry. In fact, the partnership has already created the world\u2019s first and only system to monitor real-time steel smelting activity.\n\nThe SSTL MoU with the UK STFC is timely with UK\u2019s long-term vision to increase its market share of the global space sector to 10 per cent by 20302. This is also one of the reasons the UK is the feature country for GSTC 2023, bringing 24 UK organisations to the convention to accelerate collaboration with Asia space players.\n\nOther MoUs lined up at GSTC 2023 are agreements with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Polish Space Technology Cluster Council to similarly encourage two-way deal flows through business matching, collaborations on R&D projects, and knowledge and experience transfer.\n\nEncouraging Experimentation Across Life Sciences and Climate Tech\n\nIn a highly innovative endeavour, SSTL and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, are collaborating to create an innovative space pregnancy research platform to explore the effects of microgravity and radiation on the human productive system.\n\nThis is part of a broader movement in the area of life sciences research in space. With Singapore as a well-known biotech and life sciences hub, this ambitious research programme signals a key growth area for the country to bring its space and life sciences expertise together.\n\nChangi Regional HADR Co-ordination Centre (RHCC) and SSTL announced in 2022 the launch of Asia\u2019s first feasibility study to leverage advanced space technology to predict natural disasters \u2013 particularly critical in Southeast Asia, one of the world\u2019s most natural disaster-prone regions in the world. A year on, the project has moved swiftly ahead to the prototyping stage, a significant step towards leveraging predictive analytics for more comprehensive disaster prediction and management.\n\nSingapore a Magnet for Space Entrepreneurship\n\nSSTL\u2019s Accelerator Programme, boasting a portfolio of over 40 companies with a combined valuation of close to US$850 million, has recently welcomed new startups from India \u2013 one of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing space nations.\n\nWith the Indian space sector valued at US$9.6 billion in 2020 and a goal to grow this to US$13 billion by 20253, Indian space startups are accelerating their growth by leveraging Singapore as a launchpad, not just to Asia but the global space industry.\n\nFour Indian startups have joined the portfolio, covering the breadth of developing end-to-end solutions for difficult space missions to full-stack space-engineering solutions providers and cutting-edge Earth Observation satellite technology.\n\nSSTL\u2019s Accelerator programme now has companies across 18 countries, offering the global space industry a one-stop global market for innovative space solutions.\n\nSpace Powers STEM 2.0 Movement in Education\n\nThe rapid growth of the space industry is putting pressure on the talent pipeline, creating demand for advanced STEM skillsets that are industry- and future-ready.\n\nSpace Faculty, a spin-off of SSTL, is hosting the \u2018STEM 2.0 Education Forum\u2019, held in conjunction with GSTC 2023. The platform brings together stakeholders across education, industry and government to chart the vision of STEM 2.0: the next phase of development in STEM education to enter high-value verticals like space, deep tech and advanced robotics.\n\nKey programmes aimed at creating a coherent learning pathway to take students from passion to profession \u2013 both global and local in nature \u2013 will be launched at the Forum.

Thanks to coordinated global action and legislation, the ozone layer is now on track to heal this century.\n\nRocket launches emit both gases and particulates that damage the ozone layer. Reactive chlorine, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides (among other species) are all emitted by contemporary rockets. New fuels like methane are yet to be measured.\n\n\u201cThe current impact of rocket launches on the ozone layer is estimated to be small but has the potential to grow as companies and nations scale up their space programmes,\u201d Associate Professor in Environmental Physics Dr Laura Revell says.\n\n\u201cOzone recovery has been a global success story. We want to ensure that future rocket launches continue that sustainable recovery.\u201d\n\nGlobal annual launches grew from 90 to 190 in the past 5 years, largely in the Northern Hemisphere. The space industry is projected to grow more rapidly: financial estimates indicate the global space industry could grow to US$3.7 trillion by 2040.\n\n\u201cRockets are a perfect example of a \u2018charismatic technology\u2019 \u2013 where the promise of what the technology can enable drives deep emotional investment \u2013 extending far beyond what the technology also affects,\u201d Rutherford Discovery Fellow and planetary scientist UC senior lecturer Dr Michele Bannister says.\n\nRocket fuel emissions are currently unregulated, both in Aotearoa New Zealand and internationally.\n\nUC Master\u2019s student Tyler Brown, who was involved in the research, says Aotearoa New Zealand is uniquely positioned to both lead and participate in this field. \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s role as a major player in the global launch industry means we can help steer the conversation. We stand to benefit enormously from additional growth in our domestic space industry, and with that comes the opportunity to ensure that global activities are sustainable for the planet as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe review lays out detailed plans of action for companies and for the ozone research community, with a call for coordinated global action to protect the upper atmosphere environment. Actions that companies can take include measuring the emissions of launch vehicles on the test stand and in-situ during flight, making that data available to researchers, and putting effects on ozone into industry best-practise rocket design and development.\n\n\u201cThe international ozone research community has a strong history of measuring atmospheric ozone and developing models to understand how human activities could impact this critical layer of our atmosphere. By working with launch providers, we are well-placed to figure out what impacts we might see\u201d, says Dr Revell.\n\n\u201cRockets have exciting potential to enable industrial-level access to near-Earth space, and exploration throughout the Solar System. Creating sustainable global rocket launches is going to take coordination across aerospace companies, scientists, and governments: it is achievable, but we need to start now,\u201d says Dr Bannister. \u201cThis is our chance to get ahead of the game.\u201d\n\nEnvisioning a sustainable future for space launches: a review of current research and policy, Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand",

How will reproductive organs and the foetus respond to the harsh space environment and radiation?\n\nTo address these unknowns, researchers from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine) and space organisation Singapore Space and Technology (SSTL) are embarking on a \u201cspace pregnancy\u201d research project. Through simulation experiments on Earth, they will explore how radiation and microgravity in the cosmos will affect the human reproductive system.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to be a space-faring society and if humans inhabiting other planets become a reality, having families and babies will be an important thing to consider,\u201d said Associate Professor Mahesh Choolani, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department in NUS Medicine.\n\n\u201cFor women, we have to think about the ovaries and the eggs and the foetus when pregnancy happens. Most important of all, we need to know the impact on the placenta, the master organ that helps the baby grow.\u201d\n\nThis life sciences experiment is one of several efforts under way to propel Singapore\u2019s small but budding space industry forward. The efforts were announced on Wednesday at the annual Global Space and Technology Convention.\n\nAt an NUS lab in 2022, Prof Mahesh and his team took human stem cells from the umbilical cord and exposed them to a lunar gravity environment using a small microgravity chamber. Microgravity is the condition of weightlessness in space, and the Moon\u2019s gravity is about a sixth of the Earth\u2019s.",

Further, the space domain by itself is characterized by high investments and long gestation periods for return on investment, one of the three authors of the concept paper, ISpA director Wing Commander Satyam Kushwaha (rtd) has said.For the reasons stated above as well as due to the government\u2019s control over the space domain earlier, the bulk of such technical infrastructure for testing, calibration and validation is held by the government agencies like the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and other government-assisted labs.While in recent times, the government has shown the inclination to give access to some of its infrastructure to the private industry, \"there still exist challenges to their access and affordability on various counts which are impacting the pace of progress of our young startups, which operate under very thin budgets, the tight investor is driven milestones and very limited human resources,\" Kushwaha said in his paper.Given the above scenario, India must urgently invest in new-generation technical infrastructure as part of the STP to provide single-window affordable access to entrepreneurs for technology/product design, development, testing, validation and simulations, he suggested.The key inputs for creating a comprehensive STP incentivization policy include administrative aspects, a single-window mechanism, financial enablement, a legal and policy framework, and skill and capacity development.The government framework required to enable STP development includes the adoption of a national geospatial policy and international cooperation and harmonization. The framework for STPs includes centres of excellence, ground infrastructure and facilities, testing facilities and services, a regulatory sandbox, and legal/intellectual property rights support.The present status of STPs in India includes the Space Manufacturing Park and the Kerala Space Park, both of which are initiatives of the government and ISRO. The STPs will act as a comprehensive facility & state-of-the-art accelerator that provides support and resources to space-related startups, entrepreneurs, and businesses.The infrastructure of the park would include state-of-the-art laboratory space, office facilities, and meeting rooms, as well as access to high-speed internet, advanced computing resources, and other essential tools and equipment.Aashish Kumar and Abhinav Dubey , research assistants at ISpA co-authored the paper.Lieutenant General AK Bhatt (retired), Director General, ISpA, said, \"The development of STP is a critical step in the advancement of the country's space industry and will have far reaching impacts on the economy, infrastructure, and quality of life in the years to come.\"",

(KMTV) \u2014 The Omaha Public Library along with several of its partner organizations is looking to the community for feedback, including a survey, to determine the future of what will be included inside its branches.\n\nThe library also expects to announce around five or six community events to influence the 2023 \"Library Facilities Plan,\" said Assistant Library Director Rachel Steiner to 3 News Now.\n\nThe survey is available at OPLsurey.org and at OPLencuesta.org in Spanish, or on paper at any branch.\n\n\"We want people to dream and dream big because libraries really are about community gathering,\" Steiner said.\n\nSteiner said they want to hear from people who don't frequent Omaha's libraries.\n\n\"What would we need to add to our library spaces for you to come in and use it?\" Steiner asked. \"If that is a business center ... a quilting room. Whatever your heart desires, put on the (survey).\"\n\nThe survey will run until the end of April and results will be released before the end of June.\n\nInvolved in the process are non-profits Heritage Omaha and Do Space.\n\nHeritage Omaha has been heavily involved in the library's transformational announcements over the last year, including funding the bulk of the city's yet-to-be-built Central Library at 72nd and Dodge Streets.\n\nDo Space resides at the site of the central library project and will be integrated into the public library and its branches, Steiner said.\n\nNew York design firm Margaret Sullivan Studios is also involved. Steiner said they are helping run the survey and can provide a \"more neutral eye\" to the results.\n\nSteiner said the survey is not about where libraries are located or the central library project. She said that was part of a 2017 project.\n\n\"Omaha's doing pretty good other than we need more libraries in our west as we grow in population and grow in where our people are located,\" Steiner said. \"But we never really looked at what are we doing in this space.\"\n\n\"We really want to know what people want inside the library,\" she said. \"The survey is going to focus on what could you see that we already have and you maybe don't want us to ever modify, but more importantly, what do we not have that you would love to see in your branch? And then hopefully we can implement them in the future.\"\n\nSteiner pointed to the central library's expected automatic retrieval system as a door for unique opportunities in libraries. Books would be stored in a condensed fashion to allow the library to make room for creative use of its space without trimming its collection, she said.\n\n\"(Books in the automatic retrieval system) can still be accessed, just ... it'll take a day instead of a moment to get it,\" she said.\n\nDespite the proximity of the Swanson branch to the central library expected at 72nd and Dodge, Steiner said there are no plans to close to branch.\n\n\"As far as I know at any conversation I'm in, it will remain a branch,\" she said. \"What it looks like could transform (based on community feedback) ... We also realize even though the central library will be very close, there is something near and dear to people's hearts when they have a branch that they can call their own.\"\n\nSee the full press release below:\n\nOmaha Public Library (OPL), Omaha Public Library Foundation, the City of Omaha, Do Space, and Heritage Omaha are working together with the Omaha community and Margaret Sullivan Studios (MSS), a nationally recognized library expert and design firm that specializes in civic projects, to develop a community-driven 2023 Library Facilities Plan.\n\nThe 2023 Library Facilities Plan will offer recommendations for present and future OPL facilities. The plan will include each library branch\u2019s size, location and design, and ensure that those branches continue to support the collections, programs, technologies, activities and amenities community members value.\n\nThe plan will also envision future Do Space spaces and programming in partnership with OPL, and align Do Space services with Omaha\u2019s digital equity needs and the needs of the city\u2019s entrepreneurs and makers.\n\nA new 2023 community survey launched on Feb. 15 at OPLSurvey.org focuses on Douglas County\u2019s 12 branch libraries and what community needs look like in each of those diverse Omaha neighborhoods.\n\nFeedback received during this process will be used to shape the future of OPL and Do Space services, spaces and more. The community survey will be open for responses until May 1, 2023.\n\nPaper copies are available in English and Spanish at each OPL branch and Do Space. A Spanish version of the survey is available online at OPLEncuesta.org.\n\nA series of neighborhood-focused community engagement opportunities will begin in March. More information on dates, times and locations for those opportunities is coming soon.\n\nSince the completion of the 2017 Facilities Plan update, there have been significant changes at OPL. These changes include responding to evolving community needs during the pandemic; a new downtown branch location; launch of design development for a new central public library at 72nd and Dodge streets; and the ongoing evolution of a 21st-century service model, prioritizing active public spaces and the integration of traditional library services with innovative technology services through a new partnership with Omaha\u2019s Do Space technology library.\n\nThe historic investment in a new world-class central library for the City of Omaha is now underway \u2014 including a state-of-the-art automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) Collections Hub, and the integration of nationally acclaimed Do Space programs and services.\n\nThis offers OPL an exceptional opportunity to harness momentum for reimagining library facilities to serve Omaha\u2019s diverse communities. This citywide Library Facilities Plan will build on the recommendations of previous facilities planning, take into account the City\u2019s objectives to ensure equity, and be informed by the community\u2019s input.\n\n\u201cThe plan\u2019s recommendations and future funding investments will be rooted in the community\u2019s needs and aspirations,\u201d said Margaret Sullivan, principal at MSS.\n\nThe foundation for the Library Facilities Plan will be built using research, community engagement and key stakeholder input, continually viewed through the lens of the system\u2019s established vision and strategic impact goals. Research and engagement conducted at the beginning of the process help to build plans that analyze the current state of operations and forecast future needs.\n\nFrom there, the system develops practical, actionable strategies for how to meet long-term goals, including considerations for services, spaces, books, technology and staffing.\n\nProject and community partners will present on initial community engagement findings and the developing 2023 Library Facilities Plan at a Community Share Out in May 2023. Stay tuned for more event details.\n\nOPL will publish the final 2023 Library Facilities Plan on its website in June 2023.\n\nDownload our apps today for all of our latest coverage.\n\nGet the latest news and weather delivered straight to your inbox.",

It added that \u201cthe crew is continuing with normal space station operations and scientific research.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crew \u2014 NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin \u2014 launched to the International Space Station in September in what was supposed to be a six-month stay, with a return trip set for March.\n\nNow it\u2019s unclear when the crew will return.\n\nThe first setback came in December, when the crew\u2019s Russian-made Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft sprang a leak, spewing coolant used to keep the spacecraft at a comfortable temperature. Last month, Roscosmos said the leak was likely caused by a micrometeoroid strike \u2014 not a manufacturing defect, a conclusion that NASA said it supported. Given the damage, Roscosmos decided it would be unsafe for the astronauts to fly home in that ship, as originally planned. Instead, it said it would send up a fresh spacecraft as a replacement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat launch was supposed to happen Feb. 19. But then on Saturday, Russian engineers at the mission control center outside of Moscow discovered that another spacecraft \u2014 this one a cargo ship called Progress 82 \u2014 also had a coolant leak.\n\nNow that two spacecraft have had similar problems within months of each other, NASA officials and their Russian counterparts are confronting new questions about what caused the leaks, if they are related and whether the replacement ship might also have a similar problem.\n\nThe Progress cargo spacecraft has been attached to the space station since October. Since the leak was discovered, NASA said it \u201chas been assisting Roscosmos in collecting imagery\u201d using the space station\u2019s robotic arm.\n\nNormally, crews rotate out after six-month stays on the space station, and Rubio, Prokopyev and Petelin were to return when a replacement crew flying the next spacecraft, Soyuz MS-23, would relieve them. Since Roscosmos is now sending that spacecraft as a rescue vehicle, the replacement crew won\u2019t fly until September. And so Rubio, Prokopyev and Petelin would be extended until the new crew arrives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to reporters last month, Joel Montalbano, NASA\u2019s space station program manager, said that the crew is \u201cprepared to stay until the September launch date, if that\u2019s the case. If that launch day moves up earlier, then they\u2019re prepared to come home earlier.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said that the launch of the next crew would be determined once the replacement craft is launched and attached to the station. NASA and Roscosmos are eager to get the replacement ship to the station because it would be used as an evacuation vehicle in the unlikely chance of an emergency aboard the station.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

(Photo by Sun Fengxiao/Xinhua)\n\nBEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Multiple engineering experiments are currently underway, or poised to begin, at a cabinet on China's space station which is in a near-Earth orbit. These experiments aim to acquire know-how that can support more experimental possibilities and human survival in outer space.\n\nThe Space Basic Experiment Cabinet mounted on the country's space lab module Mengtian is carrying its first group of five experiments on space technology, figuring out how to resist microbes that may eat away spacecraft metals, produce oxygen from algae in space, and convert heat energy into electricity.\n\nMICROBES AND ALGAE\n\nOne of the drawers installed onto the cabinet is the microbial resistance facility. Microbes tend to have significant corrosive influence on materials in a confined space module, which makes effective in-orbit management of them crucial for any long-term space presence.\n\nThe facility in a detachable box is projected to complete the first high-throughput microbial resistance experiment in the world, in which the microbial growth will be actively controlled in microgravity before implementing PCR testing and subsequent quarantine and disinfection.\n\nThe first microbe being tested is fungus Aspergillus niger, a type of mildew that may corrode the copper and aluminum alloy.\n\nThe box will be used as a key biological safety platform for scientific research and technical identification in the space station, according to the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST).\n\nAside from potential hazards, the biological chemistry in space can also be utilized to produce fundamental elements for human survival. An algae cultivation test in the cabinet is designed to examine how efficiently the water plant can generate oxygen and how to cook it on site.\n\nMicroalgae is a primary producer on Earth that makes the planet oxygen-rich and it is believed to be highly tolerant to zero-gravity and cosmic radiation. Also, some kinds of it are capable of synthesizing protein, fatty acid, and sugar-like nutrients to offer safe food supplements for astronauts.\n\nIn Mengtian, the algae will be cultivated in both solid and liquid culture and then the liquid-supported algae will be heated in a \"microwave oven.\"\n\nThis is a significant attempt that may lay a foundation for extended space travel and long-term human habitation in the future, said the CAST.\n\nPOWER AND METALS\n\nA pilot engine called Stirling thermoelectric convertor has also been put on the experimental rack. The heat-to-electricity conversion tech involves two pistons in a cylinder moving at high frequency, which can convert thermal energy to electricity with relatively high efficiency and power density.\n\nChinese engineers are trying to verify the feasibility and stability of it in orbit, so as to provide clues for developing advanced power technology in space that can be used in future deep-space exploration.\n\nAnother experiment in the cabinet may tell material scientists how to utilize the liquid metal in space.\n\nThe alloyed metals like those gallium-based and bismuth-based ones can flow at normal temperature or slightly higher than that. They exhibit several desirable properties including good conductivity, high boiling points and good capacity for heat transmission.\n\nSuch an experiment on Mengtian will verify the liquid metal's performance in rapid melting, electromagnetic drive, sealing and inflation protection, which may help give birth to emerging and disruptive technologies, according to the CAST.\n\nThe last of the five experiments is set to evaluate the hazards of chippings produced by a device based on friction between electric brushes and slip rings. The device is used for power and signal transfer in solar array drive assembly and spacecraft altitude control gyroscope.\n\nHowever, it's still unknown how those rubbing fragments floating in the capsule will affect space work -- how those granules move or whether they will cluster in microgravity.\n\nThe test is designed to take pictures of their real motions to lay a foundation for an optimized device that can ensure long-duration operation of spacecraft, according to the CAST. \u25a0",
