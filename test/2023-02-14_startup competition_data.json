            "text": "Hatch has joined forces with Draper Startup House to unveil Colombo\u2019s first-ever co-living space. The space marks the first phase of Hatch\u2019s strategic partnership with Draper Startup House, and was officially opened by Silicon Valley billionaire investor Tim Draper during his recent visit to Sri Lanka. Through this initiative, Hatch serves to encourage digital nomad entrepreneurs to collaborate with local startups by providing the necessary infrastructure and a supportive community for them to connect and engage.\n\nThe co-living space is located at Orion City in Colombo 09 - the heart of the best and brightest of Sri Lanka\u2019s IT/BPO Industry. Known as Colombo\u2019s first IT park, Orion City houses a diverse mix of Nasdaq-listed global companies and up-and-coming local startups. With the addition of the co-living space the business center now aims to provide a space conducive to community creation, where digital nomads can engage with founders within the Sri Lankan startup ecosystem. Since its inception, Hatch has been at the forefront of providing incubation and acceleration programs for startups and has earned recognition for its award-winning co-working space. The co-living space is an extension of these efforts, with the goal of positioning Colombo, and Sri Lanka, as a strategic location for digital nomads to get inspired, find success, and support the economy.\n\n\u201cWe seek to redefine the traditional digital nomad by attracting entrepreneurs who build businesses out of Sri Lanka using local talent and their international contacts for distribution and sales,\u201d said Jeevan Gnanam, co-founder of Hatch, referring to \u2018traditional digital nomads\u2019 as those who would typically only contribute to the local economy by bringing in foreign exchange and supporting local businesses in the short term. \u201cOur co-living space will encourage collaboration between digital nomads and local startups/entrepreneurs to make their contributions to the local economy more sustainable and impactful, all while supporting the existing infrastructure in place from coworking spaces to startup accelerators.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Hatch launched Sri Lanka\u2019s first-ever digital nomad ambassador program, the NOMAD4LK competition. Run in collaboration with the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka, ENPACT e.V. in Berlin, Germany, and the Colombo Embassy in Berlin, the competition aimed to initiate engagement between digital nomads visiting Colombo and the local startup ecosystem. The winner of the competition, Matt de Caussin, an American entrepreneur residing in Germany, traveled to Sri Lanka amidst challenging economic times. Despite facing fuel shortages, electricity outages, and uncertain travel schedules, de Caussin chose to stay and was able to build a supportive community that provided him with the necessary support and direction to manage his travels. This program served to demonstrate the potential for collaboration when the right infrastructure is in place\u2014potential Hatch is poised to tap into.\n\nSri Lanka is renowned for its beautiful landscapes and low cost of living, earning it the No. 2 spot in Club Med\u2019s \"Top Countries in the World to Live as a Digital Nomad\" in 2021. Hatch sees opportunity amidst crisis and seeks to help realize a robust economy for Sri Lanka by playing to its strengths as a global tourist destination. Beyond Hatch X Draper Startup House, Hatch\u2019s efforts to build a sustainable startup ecosystem in Colombo will pave the way for more sustainable economic development for Sri Lanka.\n\nImage Caption: Hatch X Draper Startup House teams at the official opening of the co-living space at Orion City",

            "text": "Mechanical engineering alumnus Tim Balz is CEO of Kalogon Inc., an award-winning startup that\u2019s developing smart cushions for wheelchairs, pilot seats and other future uses \u2013 with help from several alumni and student interns.\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit fostered at Rose-Hulman has inspired 2017 mechanical engineering alumnus Tim Balz to make a difference in others\u2019 lives by revolutionizing the seat cushion industry, thanks to help from his alma mater\u2019s students and alumni network.\n\nAfter finding success with SpaceX in his first postgraduate job, Balz started Kalogon Inc. with several fellow engineers to invent the world\u2019s first smart cushion. The innovative product was recently named the Most Innovative Product in Accessibility at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas while Kalogon has been recognized as one of the Top Startups to Watch in Orlando\u2019s competitive business scene by the Orlando Business Journal.\n\nThe company raised $3.3 million in seed funding in 2022, including an investment by 19 alumni from the Sawmill Angel Network, and an additional contract from the United States Air Force has allowed for a progressive scale up in operations domestically and internationally, an increase in staff (including hiring several Rose-Hulman student interns), and expansion of production capabilities.\n\nKalogon uses patented intelligent pressure sensors within a wheelchair cushion to analyze five pressure points and continuously redistribute weight to adapt to the needs of the user, giving people the ability to sit longer (like fighter pilots on long-distance flights), and pursue activities they were unable to before. Meanwhile, connected app technology enables wheelchair users, caregivers, and clinicians to browse comfort presets or customize and upload their preferred settings to personalize their smart cushion and optimize pain relief.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a mission to redesign wheelchair technology to help prevent these injuries and give wheelchair users the freedom to do what they love,\u201d said Balz, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, after announcing the valuable seed financing. \u201cThis is the first step in our journey to revolutionize seating for everyone.\u201d\n\nBalz has attributed much of his life to giving individuals with a variety of mobility disabilities access to modern technology to aid in their independence. At age 15, he founded Freedom Chairs, a wheelchair refurbishment charity, and has donated more than 150 chairs to people throughout the world. As a Rose-Hulman student, Balz created the Intel Connected Wheelchair that was named the top Internet of Things Device of 2014 by Intel. He also helped form the Make It Happen group through the Branam and Kremer Innovation Centers\u2019 MakerLab to create a therapeutic device for a child in Moldova and contributed to a variety of hands-on projects for Rose-Hulman Ventures\u2019 clients.\n\n\u201cI was determined to go to Rose because I didn\u2019t want to be treated like a number. Rose tailored my education to equip me to go out and follow my passions. That\u2019s why I created Kalogon, so that I could use my skills to change the world,\u201d said Balz while accepting the Rose-Hulman Alumni Association\u2019s 2022 Distinguished Young Alumni Award. \u201cRose cares about what you\u2019re going to do with the education you received here. For that I will be forever grateful.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving SpaceX, Balz sought \u201cthe most talented engineers I knew,\u201d many of them former Rose-Hulman classmates and friends, and others committed to helping wheelchair users. They started by doing research at a local senior living facility to garner feedback from residents, and to understand the impact of pressure-induced injuries. The team discussed concept designs with local wheelchair users, caretakers, and clinicians; the eventual initial prototype of the smart cushion was the culmination of what Balz called a \u201cweek-long, round-the-clock sprint.\u201d\n\n\u201cWheelchairs haven\u2019t changed substantially for decades, and we believe that by improving the cushion, we can address the biggest pain points for wheelchair users,\u201d said Balz. \u201cEarly Kalogon users have already reported significant improvement in overall comfort and wellness, gaining a greater sense of freedom to live more active lives.\u201d\n\nPressure injuries affect millions of people throughout the world annually and the recent shift to remote work has people pondering whether sitting for too long could be damaging their body in some way or another. Kalogon\u2019s solution, in theory, is to reduce the pressure on the various parts of the body that are most affected \u2014 essentially the buttocks, thighs and tailbone area.\n\nKalogon\u2019s solution, a cushion called the Orbiter, has five distinct regions, corresponding to the tailbone and left and right thigh and posterior areas generally. By keeping four of the five inflated, the user is supported adequately and a whole area is relieved of pressure. Then a few minutes later it slowly shifts that pressure to the next region.\n\nBalz was recently named one of Orlando Business Journal\u2019s 40 Under 40 for his work in co-founding Kalogon with electrical engineer Connor Crenshaw, a 2019 electrical engineering graduate, and Aaron Jones, a 2017 mechanical engineering graduate. A board member is Jeff Ready, a 1996 computer science alumnus, while Sawmill Society members have provided valuable business operation expertise.",

            "text": "Rebellions Inc, a South Korean startup, has launched an AI chip, ATOM, to win government contracts and challenge global leader Nvidia Corp.\n\nThe South Korean government is investing more than US$800 million over the next five years for R&D to lift the market share of Korean AI chips in domestic data centers from zero to 80% by 2030.\n\nRebellions\u2019 ATOM is designed to excel at running computer vision and chatbot AI applications, consuming only about 20% of the power of an Nvidia A100 chip on specific tasks.\n\nIn the last decade, Nvidia Corp., the US chip-making giant, has evolved from just a designer of graphical processing units (GPUs) used for video games to becoming an artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse. Today, the company controls the AI chip market, with some analysts estimating its global share to be 80%. This dominance powers AI applications ranging from autonomous cars to robots to crypto mining.\n\nSome data suggests that Nvidia has virtually no competition in its dominant chips. MLCommons, the industry consortium that oversees the popular machine learning performance test MLPerf, says that in three years, Nvidi has only had one competitor: CPU giant Intel. Additionally, since generative AI has been the talk of the town lately, rapid growth from ChatGPT usage, according to Citigroup Inc., could result in Nvidia sales of between US$3 billion and US$11 billion over the next 12 months.\n\nIn short, Nvidia will undoubtedly be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI \u201carms race\u201d triggered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Moreover, the US chip designer has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86% of the computing power of the world\u2019s six largest cloud services as of last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis. Reaching Nvidia\u2019s level would take years, even with the rapid pace of technological progress.\n\nHowever, a company in South Korea is poised to give Nvidia a run for its money, particularly in AI chips. To begin with, the South Korean government aims to create a market that can be a testing ground for AI chipmakers to foster global competitors. The government plans to invest more than US$800 million over the next five years in research and development.\n\nTAIWAN PASSED ITS CHIPS ACT ALLOWING CHIPMAKERS TO FLIP R&D COSTS INTO TAX CREDITS\n\nThe aim is to increase the market share of Korean AI chips in domestic data centers from nearly zero to 80% by 2030. In 2020, the country\u2019s information and communications technology regulator even announced plans to develop up to 50 types of AI-focused system semiconductors by 2030, Yonhap News Agency reported. The government will seek out thousands of local experts to lead this new wave of innovation.\n\nLocally made AI chips, starting with ATOM\n\nIn line with the country\u2019s goal, a Korean startup, Rebellions Inc., launched an AI chip recently in an effort to win government contracts. Known as ATOM, the chip represents the latest Korean attempt to challenge global leader Nvidia Corp. in the hardware that powers AI technology.\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters, Rebellions\u2019 ATOM chip is designed to excel at running computer vision and chatbot AI applications. \u201cAs it targets specific tasks rather than doing a wide range, the chip consumes only about 20% of the power of an Nvidia A100 chip on those tasks,\u201d the report stated, quoting Rebellions co-founder and chief executive Park Sunghyun.\n\nNvidia\u2019s A100 is the most popular chip for AI workloads, and is powerful enough to \u201ctrain\u201d AI models, as it is commonly known in industry jargon. ATOM, on the other hand, designed by Rebellions and manufactured by Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co., does not do training. \u201cThe government is twisting the arm of data centers and telling them, \u2018Hey, use these chips,'\u201d Park added.\n\nWithout such support, he said, data centers and their customers would likely continue to use Nvidia chips. Gartner\u2019s analyst Alan Priestley mentioned that there has been a lot of momentum behind Nvidia\u2019s developments, which it will take time for startups in South Korea to build. According to an official at the Ministry of Science and ICT in South Korea, Seoul will be issuing a notice this month for two data centers, referred to as neural processing unit farms, and only domestic chipmakers will be allowed to bid.\n\nSapeon Korea Inc., the first Korean company to develop an AI chip, also plans to participate in the project, according to SK Telecom Co subsidiary. FuriosaAI, a South Korean AI-powered chip design house, will also be bidding. Meanwhile, Rebellions will attempt to participate in the government project as part of a consortium with KT Corp, a major Korean telecom, cloud, and data center operator, with the aim of winning customers away from Nvidia\u2019s US supplier.\n\n\u201cAmid high dependence on foreign graphics processing units (GPUs) globally, the cooperation between KT and Rebellions will allow us to have an \u2018AI full stack\u2019 that encompasses software and hardware based on domestic technology,\u201d KT vice president Bae Han-Chul noted.",

            "text": "South Korean startup Rebellions has launched a new AI chip called Atom, Reuters reported on Monday. The new chip is an attempt by the startup to compete against US chipmaker Nvidia, which presently dominates the AI chip market.\n\nRebellions aims to provide a domain-specific AI processor along with optimized software. \u201cThis approach, together with our unique decentralized programming model, will enable customers to arm with the most powerful yet energy efficient AI hardware as well as seamless software integration,\u201d the company said on its website.\n\nRebellions is backed by one of South Korea\u2019s largest telecom operators KT, who is both an investor as well as a prospective customer for Rebellions.\n\nThe Atom chip is \u201cdesigned to excel at running computer vision and chatbot AI applications,\u201d Rebellions co-founder and Chief Executive Park Sunghyun told Reuters. \u201cBecause it targets specific tasks rather than doing a wide range, the chip consumes only about 20% of the power of an Nvidia A100 chip on those tasks,\u201d he said.\n\nSouth Korean government pushes chip production\n\nAnalysts believe Rebellions\u2019 new chip could boost South Korea\u2019s ability to compete in the AI chip domain, currently dominated by Nvidia.\n\n\u201cThis Atom AI chip by Rebellions will give competition to Nvidia AI chips. AI chips is the fastest growing segment in semiconductors. It is good to have competition in this space,\u201d said Pareekh Jain, CEO at Pareekh Consulting.\n\nThus, \u201cIt has a good shot in scaling up and becoming a competitor to Nvidia,\u201d he said.\n\nThe South Korean government has been trying to strengthen research and development in the AI chip sector with the objective of enhancing its presence in the domestic data center market. The government plans to allocate nearly $800 million in the coming five years, and it is expected that the demand for AI chips will account for one-third of the total demand for chips by 2030.\n\nAI chips are used in high compute intensive environment such as cloud, conversational AI, generative AI such as ChatGPT, computer vision, robotics, metaverse, self-driving cars, quantum computing, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, cybersecurity, and payments.\n\nHowever, Jain said one of the biggest challenges in adopting the new technology is cost. \u201cThe wide availability of cost-effective AI chips will help in democratizing many of these new technologies,\u201d Jain said.\n\nMore supply chain options for CIOs and CTOs\n\nCIOs and CTOs across sectors need AI chips for compute-intensive workloads. Until now, the choices were limited, with Nvidia commanding a lion\u2019s share of the market. If Rebellions is able to scale up, it can present itself as a good alternative to Nvidia.\n\n\u201cCompetition is always good for sourcing. As we have seen during the chip shortage, enterprises felt the need to diversify both chip suppliers and geographical regions to avoid supply chain risks and delays,\u201d Jain said.\n\n\u201cRebellions with the South Korean ecosystem can be a good alternative both as a supplier and also as a geographical region,\u201d Jain said. \u201cAnd if Rebellions comes with attractive pricing and offers equivalent or better performance than Nvidia, it can benefit CIOs even on the cost side.\u201d",

            "text": "The role of social media has evolved over time, becoming an increasingly important part of every company. It is to the point that some companies are using social media accounts instead of websites. Therefore, it is not surprising that startup fundraising is somewhat dependent on social media.\n\nLeverage Social Platforms in Startup Fundraising\n\nThere are many startups out there with talented employees, a solution people want, and a powerful mission. However, not all of those startups become successful. Sometimes the stars simply don\u2019t align, but it can also be due to a lack of reach, where a brand is not promoted properly and never develops or catches on.\n\nThat is precisely where social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook are useful. They allow startups to promote their brand and secure funding in a variety of ways, from forming connections with investors to open crowdfunding.\n\nBuild an Online Presence to Attract Investors\n\nFundraising on social media requires startups to first build an online presence that is capable of showing off their strengths and the value of its solution. First impressions mean a lot, and today, that often means social media profiles. The process of building an online presence involves things like:\n\nCreating a professional-looking profile\n\nPosting regular updates about progress and more\n\nEngaging with followers and potential investors\n\nThe goal is for the startup to convey its expertise and professionalism, thus appearing trustworthy to potential investors. Only then will an investor see it as a legitimate and well-run business worth spending time and money on.\n\nNetwork Via Social Media to Build Relationships\n\nNetworking is one of social media\u2019s primary functions, and it is not limited to friends and colleagues at work. Networking extends to people in the same field and those you wish to work for, and for startups, it includes potential investors and partners.\n\nOut of all the social platforms, LinkedIn stands out in particular since it is built for a professional audience. But all platforms offer the chance to connect with investors, experts, and entrepreneurs, allowing a young startup to build the connections it might need down the line.\n\nThe right relationships with individuals and organizations increase a startup\u2019s chances of securing funding, though that is not the only role the platforms play.\n\nPromote Fundraising Campaigns on Social Media\n\n\u201cSocial media is a powerful tool for raising funds where you can spread the word about your cause quickly and efficiently,\u201d states Rudy Mawer. \u201cWhen used properly, social media can help build wider reach and create more engagement, furthering your fundraising efforts in an effective way.\u201d\n\nAt the base level, social media is a great place for startups to post about their fundraising efforts, whether they are looking for investors or happy to announce a successful round. However, it is also a great place for crowdfunding.\n\nCrowdfunding is popular because it allows fundraising from many people, even in small amounts. Therefore, it is a perfect fit for social media since social platforms allow a company to reach a large number of people in a short amount of time.\n\nThere is also the added benefit that using social platforms to launch a fundraising campaign is a cost-effective method. Compared to traditional marketing, social media marketing makes it easy to reach a large audience without having to spend a lot of money, which is beneficial to startups that have yet to secure sufficient funds.\n\nGather Feedback and Insights to Make Adjustments\n\nAnother benefit of using social media for fundraising is that it can provide startups with valuable feedback and insights from their audience. By engaging with followers and asking for their thoughts, startups can gain valuable insights into what their target market wants and needs.\n\nThe gathered information can then be used to improve the product or service and increase its chances of success, making it more attractive to potential investors.\n\nSocial Media Impacts More Than Investor Interest\n\nResearch has shown that social media does more than simply attract interest from investors. It also impacts the likelihood that a round will close, the amount raised, and the \u201cbreadth of the investor pool.\u201d It is in part because these platforms provides channels for investors that normally wouldn\u2019t know about a company or funding round to find information and get involved.",

            "text": "Fondo, which makes tax prep and accounting software for startups, has raised $3 million in a mix of debt and equity, the company tells Axios exclusively.\n\nWhy it matters: With venture dollars harder to come by, more startups like Fondo are turning to debt financing to fund operations and expansion.\n\nWhat it does: Fondo offers a SaaS platform for early-stage startups \u2014 primarily Delaware C corps that don\u2019t yet have internal finance teams \u2014 to navigate tax compliance and bookkeeping.\n\nIt plugs into the companies' existing banking and bookkeeping systems, enabling them to compile financial statements, ensure their taxes are filed on time and maximize cash-back tax credits.\n\nSince launching in 2020, Fondo has signed up more than 500 startups to use its platform and has grown to $3 million in ARR.\n\nDriving the news: The accounting startup raised $1.2 million in equity financing from Y Combinator, Liquid2 Ventures, Transmedia Capital, GMO Venture Partners, and secured an additional $1.8 million in debt financing from Capchase.\n\nThe company decided to raise from Capchase to avoid dilution in a difficult fundraising environment.\n\n\u201cWe kept delaying [our fundraising], and then the market just took a massive crash. We had about $1.2 million, and I wanted to get to $3 million,\u201d Fondo founder David Phillips says.\n\n\u201cIf we had taken additional funding from VCs, we\u2019d take a lot more dilution because the valuation that we were getting was just not great compared to what we were getting in 2021,\u201d he added.\n\nBetween the lines: The $1.8 million in financing is one of Capchase\u2019s largest deployments of capital to date.\n\nCapchase founder Miguel Fernandez says with capital markets tightening, the firm has seen a 350% increase in underwriting over the past year.\n\n\u201cThe range goes from as little as $25k to as much as $50 million dollars, and customers go from as little as $100,000 dollars in annual recurring revenue to up to $280 million,\u201d Fernandez says.\n\nState of play: Capchase is hardly alone in the alternative financing space for startups, as it faces competition from revenue-based financing startups like Pipe and Founderpath.",

            "text": "Listen to this article\n\nAs India embarks on the journey towards self-sufficiency in manufacturing components needed for solar projects, the enormity of the challenge has become increasingly apparent as most manufacturers place orders for imported manufacturing equipment. Industry experts acknowledge the gaps in expertise but insist that the manufacturing industry first needs to develop heft in terms of capacity and ability to compete as exporters, followed by investing in research and development required to produce manufacturing equipment indigenously.\n\nMercom India, a clean energy research and communications firm, will host its first-ever Startup Pitch competition to provide a big stage for Indian entrepreneurs and companies to present their innovative cleantech ideas or technologies in early-stage development. The competition will be held at the Mercom India Renewables Summit on April 27, 2023, at 10:30 am at the Hyatt Regency in New Delhi. The competition aims to bring together the most innovative startups across India\u2019s clean energy sector.\n\nThe government has announced the discovery of 5.9 million tons of lithium reserves for the first time in the country in the Reasi district of Jammu & Kashmir. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has made the discovery. Lithium is a non-ferrous metal and a key component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The details were revealed in a GSI report along with 15 other resource-bearing geological reports and 35 geological memorandums handed over to state governments during the 62nd Central Geological Programming Board meeting this week.\n\nThe government completed the sale of \u20b9160 billion (~$1.9 billion) worth of sovereign green bonds, with the second tranche raising \u20b980 billion ($970 million) on Thursday. Like in the first tranche, the second tranche comprised \u20b940 billion ($485.56 million) worth of bonds with a five-year tenor and a like amount of bonds with a ten-year tenor. The yield on the five-year bond closed at 7.25%, and the 10-year bond closed at 7.34%. The Reserve Bank of India had set the cut-off yields at 7.23% and 7.29 % for the two bonds, respectively.\n\nThe Indore Municipal Corporation has raised \u20b93.03 billion (~$36.69 million) in green bonds, with its \u20b92.44 billion (~$29.67 million) issue being oversubscribed by 1.24 times. The proceeds from the green bonds issue will be used to fund a 60 MW ground-mounted captive solar photovoltaic project in the Khargone district in Madhya Pradesh. The green bonds received an enthusiastic response, with the issue being oversubscribed three hours after it opened.\n\nThe Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission has proposed a benchmark cost-plus tariff of \u20b93.64 (~$0.044)/kWh for utility-scale solar power projects for the financial year (FY) 2024. The Commission has also proposed a tariff of \u20b94.26 (~$0.052)/kWh for rooftop solar systems of capacity 1 kW to 10 kW (domestic consumers) and \u20b93.79 (~$0.046)/kWh for rooftop solar systems of capacity 1 kW to 2,000 kW. In a discussion paper, the Commission considered various parameters to arrive at the tariffs for the rooftop segment and utility-scale projects.\n\nU.S.-based energy storage technology and services provider Fluence\u2018s net loss for the first quarter (Q1) of the financial year 2023 narrowed to $37 million compared to $111.5 million year-over-year (YoY), primarily driven by the highest-ever quarterly order intake of $856 million. The order intake comprised 624 MW of energy storage solutions, 139 MW of services delivered, and 783 MW of digital solutions.\n\nU.S.-based battery materials producer Redwood Materials received a conditional commitment for a $2 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to commence the production of anode foil, one of the most crucial components in a battery. DOE released the commitment to Redwood as part of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.\n\nEnphase Energy, a supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems, reported a 193% YoY surge in profit at $153.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The profit was fueled by higher shipments of microinverters and batteries in the United States. During the October-December quarter, the company\u2019s revenue jumped 76% YoY to $724.7 million. The company shipped 4,874 microinverters, amounting to 1,937 MW capacity, up 61% YoY. Enphase shipped 122.1 MWh batteries in the same period, up 22% YoY.\n\nIntegrated solar tracker and software solutions firm NEXtracker, a subsidiary of diversified manufacturing company Flex, has raised $638 million in an initial public offering (IPO) by selling 26.6 million shares at $24 per share. The shares started trading on the National Global Select Market on February 9, 2023. The offering is expected to close on February 13, 2023. NEXtracker has also granted the underwriters a 30-day window to buy up to an additional 3.99 million shares at the IPO prices.",
