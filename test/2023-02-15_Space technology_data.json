            "text": "You are here:\n\nBEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Multiple engineering experiments are currently underway, or poised to begin, at a cabinet on China's space station which is in a near-Earth orbit. These experiments aim to acquire know-how that can support more experimental possibilities and human survival in outer space.\n\nThe Space Basic Experiment Cabinet mounted on the country's space lab module Mengtian is carrying its first group of five experiments on space technology, figuring out how to resist microbes that may eat away spacecraft metals, produce oxygen from algae in space, and convert heat energy into electricity.\n\nMICROBES AND ALGAE\n\nOne of the drawers installed onto the cabinet is the microbial resistance facility. Microbes tend to have significant corrosive influence on materials in a confined space module, which makes effective in-orbit management of them crucial for any long-term space presence.\n\nThe facility in a detachable box is projected to complete the first high-throughput microbial resistance experiment in the world, in which the microbial growth will be actively controlled in microgravity before implementing PCR testing and subsequent quarantine and disinfection.\n\nThe first microbe being tested is fungus Aspergillus niger, a type of mildew that may corrode the copper and aluminum alloy.\n\nThe box will be used as a key biological safety platform for scientific research and technical identification in the space station, according to the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST).\n\nAside from potential hazards, the biological chemistry in space can also be utilized to produce fundamental elements for human survival. An algae cultivation test in the cabinet is designed to examine how efficiently the water plant can generate oxygen and how to cook it on site.\n\nMicroalgae is a primary producer on Earth that makes the planet oxygen-rich and it is believed to be highly tolerant to zero-gravity and cosmic radiation. Also, some kinds of it are capable of synthesizing protein, fatty acid, and sugar-like nutrients to offer safe food supplements for astronauts.\n\nIn Mengtian, the algae will be cultivated in both solid and liquid culture and then the liquid-supported algae will be heated in a \"microwave oven.\"\n\nThis is a significant attempt that may lay a foundation for extended space travel and long-term human habitation in the future, said the CAST.\n\nPOWER AND METALS\n\nA pilot engine called Stirling thermoelectric convertor has also been put on the experimental rack. The heat-to-electricity conversion tech involves two pistons in a cylinder moving at high frequency, which can convert thermal energy to electricity with relatively high efficiency and power density.\n\nChinese engineers are trying to verify the feasibility and stability of it in orbit, so as to provide clues for developing advanced power technology in space that can be used in future deep-space exploration.\n\nAnother experiment in the cabinet may tell material scientists how to utilize the liquid metal in space.\n\nThe alloyed metals like those gallium-based and bismuth-based ones can flow at normal temperature or slightly higher than that. They exhibit several desirable properties including good conductivity, high boiling points and good capacity for heat transmission.\n\nSuch an experiment on Mengtian will verify the liquid metal's performance in rapid melting, electromagnetic drive, sealing and inflation protection, which may help give birth to emerging and disruptive technologies, according to the CAST.\n\nThe last of the five experiments is set to evaluate the hazards of chippings produced by a device based on friction between electric brushes and slip rings. The device is used for power and signal transfer in solar array drive assembly and spacecraft altitude control gyroscope.\n\nHowever, it's still unknown how those rubbing fragments floating in the capsule will affect space work -- how those granules move or whether they will cluster in microgravity.\n\nThe test is designed to take pictures of their real motions to lay a foundation for an optimized device that can ensure long-duration operation of spacecraft, according to the CAST.

Clark, USA, (Ret.) has joined Vaya Space as a senior advisor to the Board and Company to support investment in and expansion of Vaya Space\u2019s new technologies to the highly attractive Space (launch) and Defense (strategic and tactical missile) landscape.\n\nGeneral Wesley Clark\n\nGen. Clark is a retired United States Army four-star general who last served as the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe of NATO. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point as valedictorian and was subsequently awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford. Gen. Clark has received numerous military and other decorations, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver star, the Bronze star, several honorary knighthoods, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Former U.S. Presidential candidate Clark has continued his success in the private sector and has his own consulting firm, is chairman and CEO of Enverra, an investment bank that is directly supporting Vaya Space, and has worked with over 100 private and public companies on energy, security, and financial services.\n\nVaya Space significantly accelerated its pathway to disrupting both the Space and Defense sectors in 2022 with its first breakthrough patents issued, completion of more than 100 successful test fires, and its first successful launch. Vaya\u2019s engines utilize more than 20 metric tons of recycled plastics as fuel leading to costs that are more than 50 percent below that of most competitors, with equal or better thrust, stability and overall performance than any competitive technology. Vaya\u2019s technologies are also transferrable to the Defense market for strategic, tactical, and hypersonic missiles. Vaya\u2019s technologies enable variable trajectory and signature, rapid deployment, and insensitivity for storability and supply chain security. The Company expects to deliver tactical payloads at ranges exceeding 1,000 miles with precision accuracy and do so at a substantially lower cost.\n\nGen. Clark commented, \u201cI am so impressed with the integrity with which Vaya approached the Space opportunity taking a capabilities-first approach vs. that of many of the competitors. Now with their proven technologies, they are positioned to leapfrog competitors at less than a tenth of what others have already invested. Vaya\u2019s technologies are revolutionary in performance, cost, and sustainability with their ability to remove plastics from the planet. I look forward to facilitating the investment in them to make a difference for our country and for humankind.\u201d\n\nOver the past six months, Vaya has been recognized by the White House for its leadership with its apprenticeship program, was recognized for its sustainability leadership by the Green Organization at the House of Parliament in London, and has earned more than $100 million in commitments from satellite customers.\n\nSid Gutierrez, Chairman of the Board of Vaya, former Space Shuttle Commander and the first U.S.-born Hispanic Astronaut commented, \u201cFirst, General Abrams joining Vaya and now General Wesley Clark, says a tremendous amount about the Company, how far we have come, and how efficacious our technologies really are. These American heroes are incredibly focused and selective, and we are humbled that they have chosen to partner with Vaya. While in development, we were intentionally a well-guarded secret. No more.\u201d",

Institute of Technology (BCIT) for a new life sciences training program along with additional federal funding for an aerospace training program.\n\n\u201cWhat do aerospace and life sciences have in common,\u201d asked Harjit Sajjan, federal minister of international development during at press conference at BCIT\u2019s aerospace technology campus in Richmond. \u201cThey are both hotspots of growth in British Columbia.\u201d\n\nThe federal government is contributing $14.5 million toward projects at BCIT . $9.3 million of which will come from the Aerospace Regional Recovery Initiative to develop a gas turbine maintenance, repair and overhaul training program which the federal government claims is the first of its kind in North America. The program is expected to create 160 new jobs and generate an additional $360 million in revenue in B.C. by 2027, according to the federal government.\n\nSajjan highlighted that B.C.\u2019s over 200 aerospace companies makes it one of the largest such clusters in Canada and supported the program as a long-term solution to the province\u2019s airline industry shortages.\n\nMark Roesler, director of quality for MTU Maintenance Canada Ltd., a company that repairs and overhauls airplane engines says that this funding and its partnership with BCIT will develop what he calls an \u201cextremely innovative\u201d teaching concept to help fill the labour gaps within the airline industry that were exacerbated by the pandemic. Roesler says the task of finding locally existing qualified people has become an extreme hardship for the industry and has driven the need to come up with innovative solutions like the new program at BCIT.\n\n\u201cMTU is extremely proud to collaborate with BCIT to provide an enhanced and modernized gas turbine technician program that will facilitate a reinvigorated and highly trained workforce to our core business and the aviation industry here in B.C.,\u201d said Roesler.\n\nThe federal government is also contributing $5.2 million through the Regional Innovation Ecosystem Program to help BCIT establish a new life sciences program.\n\nAlong with $2 million from the provincial government, the investment will be used to create a new B.C. National Biomanufacturing Training Centre with the goal of supporting companies addressing some of the most pressing health-care challenges. Together with this funding, BCIT is partnering with the Canadian Alliance for Skills and Training in Life Sciences to develop a new program that delivers industry-informed biopharmaceutical manufacturing training in the new program.\n\nBrenda Bailey, B.C.\u2019s minister of jobs, economic development and innovation said this investment is a first step in their B.C. life sciences and biomanufacturing strategy that they planned to launch this year. She said the strategy was a key commitment that will help nurture new talent, develop new lab space, leverage post-secondary research capabilities and support employment across the life sciences sector. Bailey bragged about how B.C. is Canada\u2019s fastest-growing province in the life sciences sector and said that the BC NDP government is committed to helping to build local talent to meet the industry\u2019s needs. Bailey has the hope that this plan and other investments will help turn B.C. into a global hub for life sciences.\n\n\u201cTo the life sciences and biomanufacturing businesses I want to say: \u2018We have your backs, your future employees will soon be ready to roll,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nMurray McCutcheon, senior vice-president of partnering at AbCellera Biologics Inc.

            "text": "Measurements taken at locations around the launch pad revealed noise levels as high as 136 decibels from 1.5 km away\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 14, 2023 \u2013 When the Artemis 1 mission was launched by NASA\u2019s Space Launch System, SLS, in November, it became the world\u2019s most powerful rocket, exceeding the thrust of the previous record holder, Saturn , by 13%. With liftoff came a loud roar heard miles away.\n\nIn JASA Express Letters, published on behalf of the Acoustical Society of America by AIP Publishing, researchers from Brigham Young University and Rollins College in Florida reported noise measurements during the launch at different locations around Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe data collected can be used to validate existing noise prediction models, which are needed to protect equipment as well as the surrounding environment and community. These data will be useful as more powerful lift vehicles, including the SLS series, are developed.\n\n\u201cWe hope these early results will help prevent the spread of possible misinformation, as happened with the Saturn 5,\u201d author Kent Gee said. \u201cNumerous websites and discussion forums suggested sound levels that were far too high, with inaccurate reports of the Saturn 5\u2019s sound waves melting concrete and causing grass fires.\u201d\n\nThe combination of nighttime darkness, humidity, and backlighting provided a rare opportunity to view propagating pressure waves, which can be seen in the accompanying video.\n\nArtemis 1 was launched with four liquid hydrogen-oxygen engines plus two solid-fuel rocket boosters (SRBs). According to the authors, the SRBs are likely the dominant noise source during liftoff.\n\nThe investigators studied recordings at microphones located 1.5 km to 5.2 km from the launch pad. All stations were outside the blast danger area. Maximum noise levels at all five stations exceeded those predicted in a preliminary assessment.\n\nAt 1.5 km from the pad, the maximum noise level reached 136 decibels. At a 5.2 km distance, the noise was 129 decibels, nearly 20 decibels higher than predicted by a prelaunch noise model.\n\n\u201cThis suggests a need to revisit and probably revise those models,\u201d author Grant Hart said.\n\nA procedure known as A-weighting is often used to assess the impact of noise on humans. Because we don\u2019t hear as well in some frequency ranges as others, a filter is applied to emphasize the sounds we do hear. Using this method, the investigators found noise levels at 5.2 km from the launchpad were about as loud as a chainsaw.\n\nA characteristic feature of rocket launches is a crackling sound from shock waves. These shocks represent instantaneous sound pressure increases that are much louder than crackling noises encountered in everyday life.\n\nAuthor Whitney Coyle said, \u201cWe found the Artemis 1 noise level at 5 km had a crackling quality about 40 million times greater than a bowl of Rice Krispies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough this study is an important step forward, we still have a long way to go to understand everything about the generation, propagation, and perception of rocket noise,\u201d Gee said.\n\n###\n\nThe article \u201cSpace launch system acoustics: Far-field noise measurements of the Artemis-I launch\u201d is authored by Kent L. Gee, Grant W. Hart, Carson F. Cunningham, Mark C. Anderson, Michael S. Bassett, Logan T. Mathews, J. Taggart Durrant, Levi T. Moats, Whitney L. Coyle, Makayle S. Kellison, and Margaret J. Kuffskie. It will appear in JASA Express Letters on Feb. 14, 2023 (DOI: 10.1121/10.0016878). After that date, it can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0016878.\n\nABOUT THE JOURNAL\n\nJASA Express Letters is a gold open-access journal devoted to the rapid and open dissemination of important new research results and technical discussion in all fields of acoustics. It serves physical scientists, life scientists, engineers, psychologists, physiologists, architects, musicians, and speech communication specialists who wish to quickly report the results of their acoustical research in letter-sized contributions. See https://asa.scitation.org/journal/jel.\n\nABOUT ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA\n\nThe Acoustical Society of America (ASA) is the premier international scientific society in acoustics devoted to the science and technology of sound.

            "text": "The United States Space Force was established as the sixth and newest branch of the U.S. Armed Forces on Dec. 20, 2019 when the National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law. Before that, the United States hadn't created a new military branch since 1946, when it stood up the Air Force.\n\nThe push for a dedicated branch of the armed services devoted to the final frontier gained steam as orbital space became increasingly crowded and contested. As the United States' critical infrastructure became increasingly dependent on satellites for communication, navigation, meteorology and intelligence, the U.S. Department of Defense likewise identified a need for a branch of the military dedicated solely to operating and protecting these assets. Thus, Space Force was created.\n\nThe service's motto, \"Semper supra,\" is Latin for \"Always above,\" a phrase that encapsulates the Space Force's mission. Its symbol, the Delta, signifies the service's responsibilities and mission while honoring its long history that began long before the Space Force was created in 2019.\n\nRelated: Trump Officially Establishes US Space Force with 2020 Defense Bill Signing\n\nSpace Force history\n\nThe history of the U.S. Space Force dates back to 1954 when the U.S. Air Force created a division tasked with overseeing the U.S. military's ballistic missiles. This division evolved several times throughout the following decades and merged with other organizations as the United States began placing more satellites in orbit for communications and early missile warning systems. In 1982, the Air Force stood up Air Force Space Command, making it the first operational space command in the U.S. Armed Forces. Air Force Space Command continued to grow from the 1980s onward as the Department of Defense (DOD) sought to consolidate its space operations.\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2019, Air Force Space Command was renamed United States Space Force and was established as an independent service when President Donald Trump signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act , the laws overseen by the U.S. Congress that authorize annual military expenditures. Under the structure signed into law, Space Force would be part of the U.S. Department of the Air Force, in much the same way that the United States Marine Corps is part of the U.S. Department of the Navy.\n\nAt its creation, 16,000 military and civilian personnel were assigned to the Space Force. As of January 2023, the service consists of 4,286 enlisted service members and 4,314 officers, according to the Air Force Times (opens in new tab), making it the smallest branch of the U.S. military. The U.S. Navy, by comparison, has well over 300,000 active duty members, while the U.S. Army boasts close to 500,000 active service members.\n\nSpace Force service members are known as Guardians , a name announced in a 2020 ceremony marking the service's first anniversary. The service's service dress uniforms were debuted in a Sept. 2021 ceremony, revealing them to be a six-button double-breasted tunic that drew comparisons (opens in new tab) to the costumes worn in the sci-fi series \"Battlestar Galactica.\"\n\nTwo U.S. Space Force servicemembers pose in the service's uniforms. (Image credit: USAF photo by Staff Sgt Chad Trujilo)\n\n(opens in new tab)\n\nWhat does the Space Force do?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Space Force's mission statement (opens in new tab), the service is responsible for \"organizing, training, and equipping Guardians to conduct global space operations that enhance the way our joint and coalition forces fight, while also offering decision-makers military options to achieve national objectives.\"\n\nTo accomplish this mission, Space Force is organized into three main divisions: Field commands, Deltas and squadrons. The service's three field commands are Space Operations Command (SpOC), Space Systems Command (SSC) and Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM). Field commands oversee broad mission goals.\n\nSpace Operations Command, for example, is responsible for providing \"combat ready\" space capabilities, cyber operations and intelligence in support of U.S. military operations, according to a SpOc fact sheet (opens in new tab).\n\nSpace Operations Command provids \"combat ready\" space capabilities, cyber operations and intelligence. (Image credit: U.S. Space Command)\n\n(opens in new tab)\n\nSpace Systems Command, meanwhile, is responsible for the service's development and acquisition of new space technologies and capabilities. The command's website (opens in new tab) writes that SSC is tasked with \"developing, acquiring, equipping, fielding and sustaining lethal and resilient space capabilities for warfighters.\" This mission includes overseeing launch operations and on-orbit maintenance of DOD satellites and other space systems.\n\nSpace Training and Readiness Command, or STARCOM, as its name suggests, is tasked with educating and training Space Force personnel \"to fight and win in a contested, degraded, and operationally limited environment through the deliberate development, education and training of space professionals; development of space warfighting doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures; and the test and evaluation of USSF capabilities,\" according to its website (opens in new tab).\n\nWithin each field command are various Space Force Deltas. Deltas have a much more specific function, such as operations, training or facility support, according to a 2020 Space Force statement (opens in new tab). For example, Space Launch Delta 45 (opens in new tab) (SLD 45) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida is tasked with overseeing all space launch operations from the U.S. East Coast, including from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. SLD 45 manages the Eastern Range, a massive rocket range that stretches out over the Atlantic Ocean into the Indian Ocean, and provides launch support for the DOD, NASA and private space launch providers.\n\nA Falcon 9 rocket carrying a GPS III-5 satellite into orbit launches from LC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Fla., June 17, 2021. (Image credit: U.S. Space Force/Airman 1st Class Samuel Becker)\n\n(opens in new tab)\n\nEach Delta is further divided into squadrons, each tasked with a specific purpose that supports the overall mission of its respective field command. The 45th Weather Squadron (opens in new tab), for example, is part of Space Launch Delta 45 at Patrick Space Force Base in Florida and is responsible for performing weather observations and making forecasts in support of launch operations at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThese squadrons, Deltas, and field commands work together to ensure that the Space Force can protect U.S. space assets as Earth orbit becomes increasingly contested. In recent decades, the United States' peer adversaries such as China and Russia have advanced their own space capabilities to the point where U.S. satellites are under attack daily, according to U.S. Space Force Gen. David Thompson, then vice chief of space operations. Thompson told The Washington Post (opens in new tab) in 2021 that \"threats are really growing and expanding every single day. And it's really an evolution of activity that's been happening for a long time,\" adding that \"we're really at a point now where there's a whole host of ways that our space systems can be threatened.\"\n\nMore recent statements by U.S. Space Force leadership echo this same sentiment. Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, the branch's chief of space operations, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California in December 2022 that protecting United States capabilities in space has become one of the Pentagon's top priorities, SpaceNews reported (opens in new tab). \"The capability that space offers has demonstrated its value so much so that both sides are engaged in trying to counter those capabilities and deny those advantages to the opponent,\" Saltzman said. Space is \"clearly a contested domain,\" he added.\n\nThe ways in which satellites and other spacecraft can be threatened or countered range from reversible, non-damaging capabilities on one end such as jamming GPS transmission or using lasers to blind satellites' optical sensors , to the other end that includes destructive anti-satellite missiles , tests of which have drawn condemnation from the international community.\n\nThis image was created for the Space-Based Weapons section of the Defense Intelligence Agency's \"Competing in Space\" unclassified report, depicting space-based anti-satellite systems that target other space systems. (Image credit: National Air and Space Intelligence Center/Senior Airman Samuel Earick )\n\n(opens in new tab)\n\nThe U.S. Space Force has units tasked with tracking these threats and engaging in \" on-orbit combat ,\" although the exact capabilities of these units remain classified \u2014 as do many of the service's assets and technologies.\n\nThe U.S. Space Force systems and capabilities that are unclassified and known to the public include (but are not limited to) the Global Positioning System (GPS) , overseen by Space Delta 8 at Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado; the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (opens in new tab) (DMSP) that provides weather data to the U.S. military; and a wide variety of intelligence, surveillance and missile early warning systems like the Next Generation Overhead Persistent InfraRed (opens in new tab) system (Next-Gen OPIR), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program and the Space Tracking and Surveillance System. (opens in new tab)\n\nSpace Force also tracks objects from low Earth orbit all the way to deep space using a variety of ground-based sensors like the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (opens in new tab) (GEODSS) system.\n\nPerhaps most well-known of all Space Force assets is the X-37B , the Boeing-built space plane whose missions remain largely mysterious despite many high-profile long-duration flights in orbit.\n\nSince the creation of the Space Force, the service has largely turned to commercial launch providers to loft its satellites and other assets to orbit. Since 2020, ULA and SpaceX have been the exclusive launch providers for the U.S. Space Force, although the service is looking to partner with more providers from 2023 onward, according to SpaceNews (opens in new tab).\n\nWhere are Space Force bases?\n\nToday, U.S. Space Force operates six dedicated Space Force bases, two of which host orbital launches for the service's many satellites and spacecraft. These include:\n\nVandenberg Space Force Base is home to Space Launch Delta 30 (opens in new tab), which oversees the Western Range and manages launch activities for the DOD, NASA and private space firms. The Western Range stretches from the West Coast of the United States into the Indian Ocean, where it meets the Eastern Range.\n\nIn addition to these Space Force bases, the service operates eight Space Force stations, which include:\n\nCape Canaveral Space Force Station , Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\n, Cape Canaveral, Florida Cape Cod Space Force Station, Bourne Massachusetts\n\nCavalier Space Force Station, Cavalier, North Dakota\n\nCheyenne Mountain Space Force Station, Colorado Springs, Colorado\n\nClear Space Force Station, Clear, Alaska\n\nKaena Point Space Force Station, Honolulu County, Hawaii\n\nNew Boston Space Force Station, New Boston, New Hampshire\n\nThule Air Base, Qaanaaq, Greenland\n\nCape Canaveral Space Force Station is home to Space Launch Delta 45 and oversees launches for a variety of space agencies and companies, including NASA's Kennedy Space Center. During the historic launch of NASA's Artemis 1 mission to the moon in November 2022, for example, SLD 45 oversaw radar tracking of the agency's SLS mega moon rocket over the Eastern Range.\n\nU.S. Space Force Capt.

Sgt. James Hodgman)\n\n(opens in new tab)\n\nWhat is the Space Force symbol?\n\nThe U.S. Space Force's symbol is known as a delta. It's a triangular or chevron shape featuring elements that represent the service's mission and history.\n\nA U.S. Space Force graphic explaining the symbolism in the service's emblem. (Image credit: U.S. Space Force)\n\n(opens in new tab)\n\nThe silver outline of the delta represents the service's commitment to protecting U.S. space assets from adversaries and threats. In the center, a symbol representing the North Star, Polaris , represents the core values that guide Space Force, in much the same way the North Star has guided travelers for millennia.\n\nAlongside the North Star are four triangular elements that represent four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces: the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines. Finally, in the top of the delta symbol are two bright lines representing a rocket launching into orbit. This element symbolizes the central role of Space Force in overseeing launch operations on behalf of the Pentagon.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nU.S. Space Force represents the growing role that space plays in all of humanity's endeavors, including military operations.

Mikus Krams and Janis Vavere started the company \u2014 alumni of Lativian *soonicorn\" Lokalise \u2014 and CTO Karlis Broders.\n\nA goal to develop industrial software that addresses pervasive industry painpoints.\n\nThe Latvian company creates AI-powered tools specifically for industrial and automotive product manufacturing to manage 80 percent of the product development lifecycle, helping them build and deliver new products to the market faster.\n\nA solution for a real-world problem\n\nThe genesis of Trace.Space comes from the team members' experience in previous roles that included building and selling software for complex hardware delivery.\n\nThey saw engineers' frustration building modern-day software-enabled hardware products with outdated tools, which made it impossible to build these products at the pace of technological progress.\n\nWe're in a world filled with modern productivity tools like Slack, Miro, and Figma. But engineering projects still mainly run on outdated enterprise software with outdated UX, monolithic architecture, and hefty annual licence fees.\n\nAccording to Janis Vavere, Trace.Space Co-Founder & CEO:\n\n\"The tools used by engineering teams for requirements management are outdated, inconvenient, and cumbersome. It's a billion-dollar market that traditionally neglected because it's invisible and unsexy, while software for later steps of product development has already advanced.\"\n\nTrace.Space uses the most recent technologies to help engineering project management catch up with the modern rate of innovation.\n\nThe first product iteration is scheduled for launch in Q2 of 2023. The first functionality to be made available to users will be requirements management for engineering teams \u2014 the process of collecting, documenting, and validating requirements for the product being built.\n\nIn many industries, this is mission-critical and requires special tooling, whereas this tooling often requires special training.\n\nTrace.Space software integrates with tech such as the GPT algorithm. This will help engineering teams document and revise requirements 10x faster, simplifying the burdening task and improving their engagement in requirements authoring.\n\nAs a result, consumers can expect higher-quality products with shorter time-to-market.\n\nAdditionally, the software architecture is developed for a non-linear product development process. Combined with the help of AI algorithms, this allows users to generate an unlimited number of product variations. An always-available plan B minimises the impacts of supply chain disruptions on manufacturing, and products will be delivered continuously and on time.\n\nTrace.Space will start with modernising the basics, requirements management, and eventually, plans to do the same with further steps of product development.",
