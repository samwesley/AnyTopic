For information on tickets and sponsorships, visit here\n\nGabino and Stephen Roche\n\nHall of Fame Inductees Gabino \u201998 and Stephen Roche\n\nFollowing successful corporate careers in finance and technology, twin brothers Gabino and Stephen Roche launched Saphyre, an innovative and disruptive financial technology (fintech) venture, in 2017.\n\nSince then, the Stillman School-educated Gabino and his brother Stephen have embarked on a nonstop mission to revolutionize the way brokerage firms, custodian banks, investment managers and other financial companies manage the manual-intensive process of managing client trading accounts. Saphyre\u2019s key to success is its patent-approved AI technology that digitizes and speeds the pre-trading space, while providing trading and post-trade benefits for financial institutions at the same time. The company, which holds 105 patents, has dramatically increased the efficiency of back-office operations that formerly were accomplished with faxes, emails, phone calls and spreadsheets. Saphyre, based in Hoboken, N.J., secured $18.7 million in Series-A funding in 2022, and clients and investors include JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Blackrock, Inc.\n\nPravina Raghavan\n\nHall of Fame Inductee Pravina Raghavan, M.B.A. \u201901.\n\nPravina Raghavan serves as the director of the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Since 1988, MEP\u2019s industry experts have worked side-by-side with their partners in the public and private sectors to strengthen communities and U.S. manufacturing.\n\nRaghavan has more than 20 years of experience providing advisory services to businesses in the startup, growth, expansion and maturity phases of development. She most recently served as executive vice president in the Division of Small Business and Technology Development for Empire State Development, the New York State economic development agency. In that role, she led and managed the New York Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which provides more than $10 billion in economic impact for the state, created and implemented the $100 million New York Forward Loan Fund and Empire State Digital resource for COVID-19 small business recovery, and designed and implemented the state\u2019s $800 million COVID-19 Small Business Recovery Grant Program.\n\n\u201cWe especially look forward to recognizing the achievements of this year\u2019s Hall of Fame inductees,\" said Scherreik. \u201cGabino and Stephen Roche, and Pravina Raghavan, have pursued different entrepreneurial paths, but they share an impressive record of success and a strong love of alma mater. They are inspiring role-models for our students, whether the students seek to launch a startup company or become \u2018intrapreneurs\u2019 who are innovators in their corporate jobs.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame is also honoring Emerging Entrepreneur Paul Sannitti \u201913, who graduated from the Stillman School of Business with a management degree and a certificate in entrepreneurial studies. During high school and college, Sannitti worked at a local Friendly\u2019s Restaurant franchise, advancing from busboy to assistant store manager. After graduation, Sannitti knew exactly what he wanted to do: open his own franchise restaurant. Today, he is the owner and operator of two BGR Burgers Grilled Right restaurants. He opened his first outlet in December 2016 in South Orange, N.J. Two years later he launched a second BGR Burgers Grilled Right in Bloomfield, N.J.\n\n\u201cI chose South Orange to start my business because of my connection to Seton Hall University,\u201d Sannitti said. \u201cI had a vision of creating a great burger spot that was connected to both Seton Hall and the local community.\u201d Sannitti said he selected his second location to participate in Bloomfield\u2019s downtown community revitalization.\n\nLaunched in 2003, the Center of Innovation and Entrepreneurship within Seton Hall\u2019s Stillman School of Business serves hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students each year from across all disciplines. The Center offers entrepreneurship majors and certificate programs, scholarships and start-up grants, pro-bono professional services for emerging entrepreneurs, and dozens of extra-curricular activities and networking opportunities, including the BIG EAST Startup Challenge, which it is hosting in 2023. Past Hall of Fame inductees include such esteemed alumni as Stephen Waldis, founder and chairman of Synchronoss Technologies, Betty Manetta, president and CEO of Argent Associates, and Bryan Jakovcic, president of Fusion Health.

            "text": "Starting a new business is an exciting venture, but it can also be expensive, especially for students. To help fund your idea, you may want to consider attracting sponsors to support you, which is crucial for the growth and success of your startup.\n\nThey can provide financial support, expertise, and resources that can help your business succeed. However, securing sponsorship is not a straightforward process, and it takes careful planning, strategy, and time to succeed.\n\nYou can get more free time for this by contacting special services for help. Delegate some of your homework to professionals so that they \u201cwrite my college paper\u201d on any topic at any time while you are developing a strategy for attracting sponsors. In this article, we will tell you what else is needed for success in this case.\n\n7 Tips on Attracting Sponsors to Your Startup\n\nHere are some tips on building a strategy on how to attract sponsors to your startup:\n\nIdentify your target market\n\nIt is important to understand your target market and their needs before reaching out to potential sponsors to help you determine which sponsors will be most interested in supporting your business.\n\nResearch potential sponsors and look for companies that share similar values and interests as your startup. Doing this will ensure that the sponsor and your business are compatible.\n\nBuild a strong business plan\n\nA robust business plan is crucial to convince sponsors that your startup is a wise investment. Your business plan should include a clear description of your business idea, a market analysis, a financial plan, and a marketing plan.\n\nEnsure that your business plan is well-written, professional, and easy to understand. This will make you stand out from the competition and demonstrate your startup\u2019s value.\n\nNetwork with potential sponsors\n\nNetworking is a powerful tool for connecting with potential sponsors. Attend events, join industry organizations, and participate in online forums to meet people in your field. You may also message potential sponsors through LinkedIn, email, or phone.\n\nWhen communicating with potential sponsors, make sure to have a clear and compelling message. Be professional, friendly, and confident in your approach.\n\nMake a compelling pitch\n\nWhen meeting with potential sponsors, you\u2019ll need to present a compelling pitch that explains why your startup is worth supporting. Information about your business idea, market opportunity, and financial projections should be included in your pitch as well.\n\nBe ready to answer questions about your pitch and how you plan to spend the sponsor\u2019s support. Rehearse your pitch and have clear and concise answers to potential questions.\n\nOffer incentives\n\nSponsors are more likely to support your startup if they receive something in return. Consider offering incentives such as product samples, discounts, or access to your company\u2019s services.\n\nOffering to promote the sponsor\u2019s products or services through your marketing channels can also be a big incentive. Ensure that the incentives are relevant and valuable to the sponsor and align with your business goals.\n\nFollow up\n\nAfter your meeting with a potential sponsor, follow up with a thank you note or email. This will help keep your business on their mind and show that you are serious about working with them. Doble check that your reply is professional, friendly, and relevant to the sponsor.\n\nBe patient\n\nFinding the right sponsors for your startup takes time and effort. You won\u2019t always receive a response immediately, so don\u2019t let that deter you. Keep reaching out to potential sponsors, and be tenacious in your efforts. Ensure that you are consistent and persistent in your approach and always ready to deliver a compelling pitch.\n\nYou can find the right sponsors who can support your business and help it grow by following these tips. Make sure that you are well-prepared, professional, and confident when you approach potential sponsors and that you have a clear and compelling message.\n\nBuild the Communication Right\n\nWhen it comes to attracting sponsors for your startup, effective communication is critical. As a student, you may not have extensive experience in dealing with sponsors, but by keeping these tips in mind, you can ensure that your communication is professional, effective, and persuasive.\n\nBe clear and concise\n\nMake sure that your message is easy to understand. Avoid using industry terms or technical language that may be unfamiliar to your readers. Be straight and to the point, making sure that your message is relatable to the sponsor.\n\nKnow your audience\n\nMake sure that you have a good understanding of the sponsor\u2019s business and its goals. Do research on the company and industry, and craft your message for their particular needs and interests.\n\nShow your passion\n\nSponsors want to invest in projects that are led by passionate and motivated individuals. Showcase your passion for your business and your dedication to ensuring it becomes a success. Explain why your business is important to you and why you are the right person to lead it.\n\nHighlight the benefits\n\nMake sure that you highlight the benefits of sponsoring your startup. Explain how the sponsorship will help the sponsor achieve their goals and how your business will bring value to their company.\n\nAlways behave professionally\n\nEven if you are communicating through email or on the phone, you need to keep your professionalism. Use proper grammar and spelling, and avoid using slang or informal language.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nCombining study and business can be a challenging task, but it can also be incredibly rewarding. As a student, you have the opportunity to bring fresh ideas and a new perspective to your startup. And your education can help you make informed decisions and build a strong foundation for your future business.\n\nBy prioritizing your responsibilities, managing your time effectively, leveraging technology, seeking support from the best research paper writing services, staying focused on your goals, and taking care of yourself, you can achieve success in both your studies and your startup. Good luck!",

            "text": "Capital might be harder to come by than it once was in startup land, but some firms are bucking the trend \u2014 hard. Take Descope, for example, which today announced that it raised a whopping $53 million in seed funding for its \u201cdeveloper-first\u201d authentication and user management platform.\n\nThe money came from Lightspeed Venture Partners and GGV Capital with additional funds contributed by Dell Technologies Capital, TechAviv, J Ventures, Cerca, Unusual Ventures, Silicon Valley CISO Investments and individual investors CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz and Microsoft chairman John W. Thompson. It\u2019ll be used, Descope co-founder and CEO Slavik Markovich says, to grow Descope\u2019s product capabilities, invest in research and support open source initiatives around authentication, authorization and user management.\n\n\u201cThe Descope platform helps developers add authentication, user management and authorization capabilities to their business-to-consumer and business-to-business apps with just a few lines of code,\u201d Markovich told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cIt helps apps accelerate their time to market, increase the efficiency of their engineering resources, reduce user friction and prevent a wide variety of identity-based cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nWhy the large cash infusion \u2014 particularly large for a seed round \u2014 in a dev-focused startup, you might ask? Markovich says that it came down to timing. In tight economies, organizations feel the pressure to shift software development efforts to initiatives that\u2019ll move the needle for business. Descope enables them to achieve this, Markovich avers, by outsourcing many necessary \u2014 but not revenue-generating \u2014 authentication and user management app components, freeing up dev teams.\n\nDescope was founded last April by the members of the core team that built the security operations platform Demisto, which Palo Alto Networks acquired in March 2019. While at Demisto, the team says that they experienced the pain of building authentication and user management functionality \u2014 including password management, single sign-on, tenant management and roles and permissions \u2014 firsthand. It turned into a multiyear investment, Markovich says \u2014 not to mention a massive time sink.\n\n\u201cWith Descope, the team\u2019s vision is to \u2018descope\u2019 (hence the name) authentication and user management from every app developer\u2019s daily work, so that they can focus on business-critical initiatives without worrying about building, updating and maintaining authentication,\u201d Markovich said.\n\nMarkovich doesn\u2019t deny that there\u2019s a wealth of competition in the user authentication space, like ConductorOne, Stytch, Transmit Security and Okta-backed Auth0. (In 2021, VC investment in identity management startups reached $3.2 billion, according to Crunchbase \u2014 a record at the time.) But he asserts that Descope is differentiated by its workflow and screen editor, which are drag-and-drop as opposed to code-based and intended to let developers customize authentication flows for apps without having to write any code.\n\n\u201cThis greatly speeds up time to market and also makes it easier to modify and update user journeys flows with time,\u201d Markovich said. \u201cThese no-code workflows abstract away the complexity of building authentication while still giving app builders control over their user experience and user interface.\u201d\n\nBeyond the editors, Descope offers a set of software development kits and APIs that allow customers to add passwordless authentication methods (think biometrics, risk-based authentication and multifactor authentication) to existing apps and services. Security teams get app security flows that they can review and audit for compliance.\n\nSo why launch Descope now? There\u2019s no shortage of rival apps, after all. But Markovich says that the team felt the industry had reached an inflection point. Over 66% of smartphone users are expected to use device-native biometrics instead of passwords by 2024, he noted, citing data from Mercator, while authentication protocols like FIDO2, WebAuthn and passkeys have set the foundation for a passwordless future. The next step, Markovich argues, is enabling developers to easily add passwordless authentication methods alongside others such as social logins, one-time passwords and magic links to their apps.\n\nThere\u2019s demand to be sure. According to a recent survey by Enterprise Strategy Group, 85% of IT and cybersecurity professionals agree the adoption of passwordless technology is among their top strategic initiatives.\n\n\u201cPasswords are not only the leading cause of security breaches, but are also known to cause friction throughout a user journey \u2014 leading to churn and a negative experience for end customers,\u201d Markovich continued. \u201cThe proliferation of cybersecurity attacks due to poor identity and authentication practices such as credential stuffing, bot attacks, session hijacking, brute force attacks and other types of password compromise. Authentication and user management are critical parts of any digital application.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tough time to launch a startup regardless, what with less access to capital and uncertainty around the wider economic landscape. Descope doesn\u2019t have much traction to point to, either \u2014 the platform\u2019s in private beta and Markovich declined to comment on revenue or the size of the company\u2019s customer base.\n\nStill, Markovich claims that Descope is \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to weather a slowdown in tech, and perhaps even uniquely positioned considering challenging economies are frequently accompanied by increased fraud and cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cThe Descope team is full of seasoned startup operators that have built companies in both bull and bear markets,\u201d Markovich said. \u201cThey are experienced in allotting capital towards initiatives that move the needle for business in a sustainable, customer-centric and efficient manner.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see whether that turns out to be the case.",

The UK competition authorities are also running a probe.\n\nShould the DoJ and the Federal Trade Commission take exception to the responses they receive, they are entitled to demand recourse under antitrust laws that could involved denying the sale, or demanding Adobe divests or licenses assets of the two companies.\n\nIf cleared, this would be among the biggest takeovers of a private owned software company.\n\nFigma, which has an estimated four million users, is a browser-based app that manages file organization by listing projects and their files in a dedicated format. It requires no installation, patching or updates.\n\nThe vector-based graphic editor and prototyping tool maker was founded in 2016 and has ingested a little more than $330 million in funding since then.\n\nSome Figma users are fearful Adobe will merge Figma with its XD software \u2013 which has a little under 1,000 paying customers \u2013 and then hike subscription costs. Figma itself has around one million paying customers. Others are drawn to its freemium model and its comparatively lightweight interface.\n\nDylan Field, Figma co-founder, says users have nothing to fear about price hikes, and says the app will remain free for education users. \u00ae\n\nIf the sale is cancelled, Figma is due a termination fee of $1 billion under certain conditions. \u00ae",

            "text": "After spending the past three years providing a safety net for Australian entrepreneurs looking to scale up their businesses, startup insurance group UpSure is poised to bring its niche offering to a wider market with plans to expand into the UK.\n\nUpSure co-founder Andrew Birt says startup-specific insurance plans often get overlooked by early-stage ventures seeking to grow. Generally, they rely on \u201csuburban brokers\u201d to cover growth risks for their businesses.\n\nBirt, whose background in the investment sector led him on many startup journeys, points out that the insurance needs of a fintech are significantly different to a company developing a physical product. Insurance needs also change depending on whether startups are in the seed funding stage or planning to scale up.\n\n\u201cThe sub-sectors of the startup market each have their own risks that founders and startups need to address,\u201d says Birt.\n\nThe Brisbane-based UpSure, which Birt established with insurance industry professional Matt Almond in 2020, has struck a chord with the startup community by recording 300 per cent year-on-year growth since then.\n\nThe insure-tech currently has more than 220 startups and scale-ups on its books, including the likes of Forcite, Thrive, Payble, Joyride, AirBolt and Greener.\n\nUpSure is currently writing just under $2 million in gross written premium a year, with plans to continue growing its base in Australia where competition is pretty thin for its niche insurance offering.\n\n\u201cWe have had consistent month-on-month growth,\u201d says Birt. \u201cThe vast majority of our clients are staying with us year on year and our goal is to get to the $1 million recurring revenue point sometime this year and we\u2019ll continue to grow from there.\u201d\n\nBirt says plans are afoot to establish a foothold in the UK this year as a prelude to future expansion into Europe.\n\n\u201cWe already have a relationship in the UK to launch the same business model there,\u201d says Birt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently hiring ahead of broking for that market now. The UK is definitely the next market we want to tackle and from there we could expand into Europe.\u201d\n\nUpSure is planning a seed round this year to help fund its push into the UK. While the details of that round have not been disclosed, Birt says it will be much larger than the company\u2019s $1.1 million pre-seed funding campaign which was backed by community broker network CBN Australia, a small cap venture fund from Germany and local angel investors.\n\nBirt sees solid prospects for global expansion in a sector that is largely underserviced. Among the biggest names in the sector is California-based Vouch which raised US$90 million $130.4 million) at the end of 2021, valuing the company at US$550 million ($796.8 million). Vouch has a big presence on its home turf supporting startups in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cIn comparison, the competitors we face in Australia is the conventional broking market that covers insurance for houses, boats and the like,\u201d says Birt.\n\n\u201cMany of our clients are moving to us from a traditional broker. A lot of times these businesses may not have even been able to secure insurance as they may have been rejected by some providers.\u201d\n\nBirt sees many businesses in the midst of rapid growth lumbered with products that are not \"fit for purpose\".\n\n\u201cYou might find some companies are now quite large but they are stuck with a generic business policy that just doesn\u2019t have them covered for the type of risks they might face,\u201d he says.\n\nUpSure is part of the CBN Australia network, giving the company access to all underwriters in Australia as well as Lloyds of London agencies.\n\n\u201cWe initially thought there would be a one-size-fits-all approach but we quickly realised the diversity of the businesses that people are building in the tech sector, so our products take a bespoke approach for each client,\u201d says Birt.\n\nUpSure also sees its offering as a warning beacon for businesses on the startup journey.\n\n\u201cPeople need to get their heads around the type of risks they could face in their new venture,\u201d says Birt.\n\n\u201cIt can be handy to know where the particular potholes lie for your type of business and how you can offset those risks. That goes not only from an insurance perspective but as a startup generally.\n\n\u201cIt makes the businesses look at everything from processes, policies, legal documents, warranties and indemnities, in addition to the insurance needs to de-risk the company as it grows.\n\n\u201cIt also gives many of the people we work with insights into aspects of their business they might not have thought about.\u201d\n\nAs UpSure grows, both Birt and Almond are keen to continue cultivating a highly connected startup community around their business.\n\n\u201cI have been working with startups my whole career, developing good relationships with investors and capital partners,\u201d says Birt.\n\n\u201cI have been on the same journey as many of our clients. So, it\u2019s important for us to create that community where our clients can reach out to us at any time, and we can put them in touch with some of the founders we are working with.\u201d\n\nGet our daily business news Sign up to our free email news updates.

            "text": "Patty Post, Founder, and CEO of Checkable, is revolutionizing the healthcare market. She is on a mission to provide consumers with at-home health resources so they can save time and make informed decisions about their health in the comfort of their homes. One of her core missions is to provide an at-home Strep test to save parents the stress and time of taking their loved one to the doctor.\n\nGrit Daily talked with Patty and learned more about what has made Checkable so successful in a market that seemed so dominated by big pharma.\n\nGrit Daily: Please share more about your background and how the idea for Checkable Medical came to life?\n\nPatty Post: The idea of Checkable was born out of frustration after many years of bringing my three kids to the doctor\u2019s office to check for strep throat. I remember the exact moment when the idea came to my mind. I was at a CVS Minute Clinic with my daughter for the third time in a week. We waited over an hour to be seen, and she was quite sick. While the nurse practitioner was running the test in front of me, it was like a light bulb went off, and I said out loud, wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if I had this test at home? I built my career in medical devices, and at the time, I was working at a clinical research organization. That\u2019s how I started putting the puzzle pieces together. I knew the rapid strep test was a legacy technology, the same technology as a pregnancy test. I started getting obsessed with the question, why couldn\u2019t we put that test in every American home and empower parents to check for strep throat and not rely on the provider? I spent nine months researching why no one had done it, the path to OTC clearance, and the big question, would anyone ever fund it?\n\nGrit Daily: With so many health brands on the market, how does Checkable Medical set itself apart from its competitors?\n\nPatty Post: Checkable is a full circle at-home health eco-system. Check your symptoms easily, conveniently, and for less money with an FDA-cleared diagnostic and mobile application. Get a treatment plan from home with Checkable\u2019s telehealth, stay healthy, and create and maintain healthy routines with Checkable\u2019s mobile experience. Our purpose is to empower moms with the freedom to make healthcare decisions for themselves and their families from home through the use of diagnostics, telehealth, education, and community.\n\nGrit Daily: What goals did you have in mind when starting Checkable, and what are your goals moving forward?\n\nPatty Post: My goal was to have an FDA-cleared strep test with a mobile app to make the process easy for moms and dad\u2019s to run the test and interpret the results. It had to have telehealth to enable them to get the prescription with a positive test. This model can be used for so many different illnesses, and we\u2019re coming out with a rapid UTI test and vaginal pH. I think there\u2019s an incredible amount of opportunity at home in the cancer screening and genetic testing categories as well.\n\nGrit Daily: At-home testing has seen a significant increase since the pandemic. In your opinion, do you see at-home testing being a continued tool for consumers?\n\nPatty Post: Absolutely it\u2019s a tool. The world has experienced how convenient it is to test their symptoms at home and then make a decision on what to do next. They no longer need to rely on a healthcare provider to do this. They\u2019re empowered to make clinical, evidenced-based healthcare decisions from home through the use of at-home diagnostics and telehealth.\n\nGrit Daily: Why did you choose Strep as a clinical trial for your at-home test kit?\n\nPatty Post: Because I personally was frustrated with the system\u2019s protocol. For example, my two boys test positive for strep on Monday. On Wednesday, my daughter wakes up with the same symptoms; call the pediatrician\u2019s triage line to ask for a prescription for amoxicillin because my daughter has the symptoms of strep. They tell me I need to bring her in for the rapid test; they won\u2019t prescribe over the phone without a positive rapid test. This is incredibly frustrating; she\u2019s been exposed and has the symptoms. Why do I need to take half a day to check for strep? The scenario works in reverse too. Your child wakes up with a sore throat, and you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s strep or not, so you send them to school. Hours later, you get a call from the school nurse letting you know you need to pick up your child, now it\u2019s noon, and your pediatrician can\u2019t see you. Two options exist, same-day walk-in clinic or urgent care, or wait until tomorrow. Either way, you\u2019ll need to take another day off of work when you could have diagnosed it sooner, for less money and time by doing it at home.\n\nGrit Daily: Will Checkable launch other at-home tests for other illnesses and ailments?\n\nPatty Post: Yes, we\u2019re launching a line for women\u2019s health and maternity, a rapid UTI test, a rapid vaginal pH test, and two breast milk strips to determine the alcohol level in the milk and its nutritional value.\n\nGrit Daily: What\u2019s on the horizon for Checkable Medical?\n\nPatty Post: We\u2019re looking at new ways to engage our consumers on our app and researching other diagnostics that can be performed at home.\n\nGrit Daily: As a female founder and entrepreneur, what tips can you share for anyone wanting to start their own business?\n\nPatty Post: Take the risk, have the confidence, and make bold decisions for yourself and your family. The world needs more Moms to start companies and back technologies that solve mom problems. I encourage women not to make the excuse they don\u2019t have time or that their family needs them. Do it when they\u2019re sleeping, wake up early, or stay up late to complete the research and time-consuming work. The world needs your innovation and your passion.",

            "text": "Adobe\u2019s proposed plan to snap up digital design rival Figma for $20 billion has attracted the attentions of the European Commission (EC), which announced today that the proposed merger potentially \u201cthreatens to significantly affect competition in the market for interactive product design and whiteboarding software.\u201d\n\nWhile the EC acknowledged that the transaction doesn\u2019t meet the turnover thresholds set out in the EU merger regulations, meaning that the merging companies weren\u2019t required to notify European regulators, there are separate provisions in Article 22 that allow member EU countries to refer specific cases to the EC if they believe that a transaction will diminish a competition in specific European markets.\n\nA press bulletin published by the EC noted:\n\nThis provision allows Member States to request the Commission to examine a concentration that does not have an EU dimension but affects trade within the single market and threatens to significantly affect competition within the territory of the Member States making the request.\n\nAs such, the EC said that it has received requests from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden to look at the deal and determine whether there is a case to answer.\n\nScrutiny\n\nToday\u2019s news comes some five months after news first emerged that Adobe was to buy Figma, the 10-year-old venture-backed startup behind a collaborative design platform. A deal of that size was always likely to attract some regulatory scrutiny, with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) already looking closely at the deal while the U.K. is also making initial enquiries.\n\nIt was widely accepted that Europe would also look at the deal, particularly after Austria\u2019s competition watchdog sought a referral for the proposed merger last month, so today\u2019s news is not exactly unexpected.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this doesn\u2019t signal Europe\u2019s intent to launch a full investigation, just that it will request that Adobe formally notifies the EC of the transaction, which will likely kickstart an initial review at an EU level. This also means that irrespective of what happens in other jurisdictions around the world, Adobe won\u2019t be able to conclude the transaction before it\u2019s cleared by the EC.",

The startup has just secured new funding (\u00a310 million) as demand ramps up.\n\nFor many, skincare can create a bit of a headache. From knowing which products work and which don\u2019t, to being able to affordably access quality solutions, lots of consumers are left struggling with the world of skincare. It\u2019s something that impacts people\u2019s self-esteem and confidence, but access to dermatologically-backed products just isn\u2019t so accessible.\n\nAiming to change this, by taking a more consumer-friendly prescription-based and personalised approach to skincare, is Skin + Me. The startup\u2019s platform has been picking up in popularity, and now, it\u2019s closed new funding to keep growing.\n\nFunding details\n\nOver \u20ac11 million (\u00a310 million) was raised in a Series B funding round\n\nThe investment was led by Octopus Ventures\n\nThis comes as the company reports growth of 100% year on year to become cash generative in just two years.\n\nLaunched in 2020, Skin + Me has developed an impact-driven teledermatology service. The startup offers custom-made treatments formulated with prescription-only active ingredients for customers looking to tackle skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, dark spots and pigmentation, or skin concerns like visible pores, fine lines or texture.\n\nUsers simply fill out a questionnaire on the online platform and can then subscribe to a personalised skincare plan. Treatment pathways are designed by Consultant Dermatologists and formulated by Pharmacist Prescribers.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that 24% of the UK population seek treatments for skin issues each year \u2013 and they\u2019re not getting the help they need.\n\nHoratio Cary, Co-Founder and CEO of Skin + Me: \u201cThe global skincare industry is worth \u00a3140bn and more than 50% of consumers are dissatisfied because they want a product that works. We built Skin + Me to make medical skincare, proven to be far more effective than any cosmetic products through decades of clinical studies, accessible to everyone. Loyalty and customer love for our products followed because they deliver results.\u201d\n\nSkin + Me has found, in a brand survey, that customers note a 133% improvement in their skin with an average baseline rating of 3/10 pre-treatment rising to 7/10 after 12 weeks of using the product. So far, the company has prescribed products to hundreds of thousands of UK-based consumers \u2013 helping people feel more confident.\n\nHoratio Cary: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen consumer awareness for prescription-only ingredients such as tretinoin grow exponentially. We expect the \u00a3140bn global skincare spend to shift quickly towards prescription-strength ingredients and Skin + Me is ideally placed as the market leader in the UK to take advantage of this trend.\u201d\n\nWill Gibbs, Partner, Health, Octopus Ventures: \u201cOctopus Ventures takes pride in backing companies that incite positive and actionable change. Increased awareness in prescription ingredients and a growing trend towards personalisation has transformed the skincare market. Skin + Me lead the charge with their accelerated growth reflecting a step change that\u2019s seen hyper-educated consumers shun off-the-shelf products in favour of highly efficacious solutions. Across Series A and Series B funding, Octopus Ventures has invested a total of \u00a313m to develop Skin + Me \u2014 deepening the relationship, and demonstrating their faith in the brand\u2019s market-leading personalisation strategy.\u201d\n\nThese new funds will be used by the medtech team to accelerate growth via continued innovations in personalised skincare and new marketing channels.",

            "text": "Thanks to the power of the internet, and the accessibility of technology, there has never been a better time to open a business that is purely online. However, thanks to the ease of creating an online business, there is a lot more competition to deal with than there was even five years ago.\n\nThat is why every online business needs to put time and effort into creating a marketing campaign so that they don\u2019t get left behind. The good news is that you don\u2019t need a degree in marketing to get noticed on the internet.\n\nHere are some ways you can market your online business and keep your business relevant in a competitive environment.\n\nDon\u2019t Underestimate the Power of Email Marketing Campaigns\n\nEven though email technology has been around since the 1970s, email marketing is still a vital component of a successful marketing campaign. This is especially true in 2022/2023 when trust in social media is at an all-time low. While consumers\u2019 trust in social media platforms may be faltering, many people still trust email-based marketing, especially when the campaign features a personal touch. Emails addressing a customer by their name, or emails with personalized subject lines, are far more effective than generalized social media posts and result in more reach than other forms of digital marketing.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure how to create an effective email campaign, help is available. Full-service marketing companies can offer advice on most types of digital marketing, so consider this expert agency that can help construct an effective email campaign strategy.\n\nJoin Our Small Business Community Get the latest news, resources and tips to help you and your small business succeed. First Name Sign Up for Newsletter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER\n\nKnow the Value of High-Quality Content\n\nOnline businesses are a dime a dozen, so to really stand out amongst competitors, an online business should put effort into building its brand into one that consumers can trust. Creating high-quality informative content is a great way to ensure that your online business isn\u2019t written off as just another fly-by-night scam site that is only after the sale.\n\nA website for a brand with an authoritative voice in its niche will be more likely to convert sales than a website dedicated solely to item lists. Blog posts, information sheets, resource pages, and comparison pages can help give customers the information they need to make informed decisions about the products you carry on your website and help convert clicks to sales.\n\nMarket Yourself as an Expert in Your Field\n\nBy releasing high-quality content on your website, you will be positioning yourself as an expert in your field. This is a great way to build trust in your brand, which is important for the continued success of your business. Whether you write these posts yourself or hire the services of a media company, the time and effort you put into being a thought leader in your market sector should pay off in the long run. Marketing campaigns focused on building trust in the brand and sharing your business\u2019s core messaging and ideals are a great way to use to drive traffic to your website, where you can shift focus and push your goods and services.\n\nEmbrace Social Media for More Reach\n\nWhile trust in social media may be on the decline, that does not mean you can ignore the benefits that these platforms offer online businesses. According to online statistics provider Statista, the number of social network users in the US exceeded 302 million people in 2022, with this number expected to rise to as much as 327 million in the next five years. This presents a major opportunity for businesses to reach new customers with the right social media campaign. By creating social media posts that are informative and engaging rather than sales-focused, you can boost your organic follower numbers which should eventually result in more sales in the future.\n\nBuild an Online Presence\n\nWhile traditional social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will be a key part of building your business\u2019s online presence, this shouldn\u2019t be where your interaction with your customers, and potential customers, should end. Online forums and communities offer excellent networking opportunities and can help you build trust in your brand. Platforms like Reddit are great starting points for this kind of interaction, and there is a subreddit available for any topic you can think of, meaning that you are sure to find the perfect niche to target with your campaign. Putting effort into being recognized as an expert in your field on the Reddit platform could help give your business the boost it needs to stay relevant and succeed in a very tough economic time.\n\nUse SEO to Boost Your Website\u2019s Ranking\n\nWhile email marketing may be outperforming most other online marketing strategies, few marketing strategies are quite as cost-effective and efficient as Search Engine Optimization (SEO). While SEO strategies have undergone numerous changes thanks to the ever-evolving digital landscape, some aspects have remained relevant throughout. Publishing authoritative and relevant content on your online business website is more important than ever and making use of keywording is still just as vital as ever before.\n\nIn fact, thanks to the popularity of SEO content, there are more tools than ever before to help businesses craft content that is sure to tick all of Google\u2019s checkboxes and improve any site\u2019s ranking. Frequent updates to your site\u2019s metadata are also important to keep your page ranking high on searches, so don\u2019t overlook this aspect when updating your website.\n\nAs the online marketplace continues to expand, competition for sales will only increase. That is why all online businesses must formulate and follow a good marketing strategy, making use of all available tools at their disposal, to ensure they stand out among the masses.\n\nFortunately, many of the online marketing tools available to businesses today are free to use, which means that they are accessible to anyone with the time and patience to learn how to make the most of them. Businesses that need a bit of help with their online marketing should consider consulting with digital marketing experts to help guide them onto the path to success.",

Founded by Purdue University researcher Young Kim, HemaChrome won phase 1 of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s RADx Tech for Maternal Health Challenge. (Photo courtesy of HemaChrome)\n\nHemaChrome uses smartphone technology to measure blood hemoglobin levels noninvasively and instantly\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \u2013 HemaChrome, a digital health startup that uses smartphone technology to noninvasively and instantly measure blood hemoglobin levels, has won phase 1 of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s RADx Tech for Maternal Health Challenge.\n\nThe technology was developed by Young Kim, HemaChrome\u2019s founder and chief science officer. Kim is a professor and associate head for research at Purdue University\u2019s Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. He also is a Showalter Faculty Scholar and University Faculty Scholar at Purdue. Huiri Kim is HemaChrome\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201cBlood hemoglobin tests are among the most common laboratory tests because they are an indicator of a variety of diseases and disorders,\u201d Young Kim said. \u201cIn fact, they are the most common laboratory tests conducted among obstetric patients. However, more than 2.2 million childbearing women in the U.S. have limited access to such testing.\n\n\u201cConventional blood hemoglobin tests are usually conducted by invasive and expensive venous blood draws, which require sophisticated equipment, highly trained experts to run the tests and patients who must be present on-site with their health care provider. Our simple app is intended to eliminate these barriers and make these tests accessible to everyone, especially those in health care deserts, by allowing clinicians to conduct point-of-care, home-based and remote diagnostic tests on their patients at a fraction of the cost.\"\n\nDuring phase 1 of the challenge, HemaChrome received a cash prize and was vetted by NIH\u2019s panel of scientific, medical and business experts for technical and commercial viability. Because it won, HemaChrome will have access to NIH\u2019s in-house and in-kind support to speed the development, validation and commercialization of its technology.\n\nHemaChrome meets twice a week with the NIH RADx team of experts as part of the process to proceed to phase 2 of the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the NIH RADx team to identify and mitigate key risk factors for the accelerated development and implementation of our technology,\u201d Young Kim said. \u201cIf we progress to the next phase, we will work with them to independently test and verify our technology\u2019s performance and usability.\n\n\u201cBecause the process to receive federal funding and support is highly competitive, winning phase 1 of the challenge has strengthened HemaChrome\u2019s resolve to bring our solution to market to benefit those without sufficient health care access who need it most.\u201d\n\nYoung Kim\u2019s research about this technology has been published in several publications and peer-reviewed journals, including the November 2022 issue of Blood and the June 2020 issue of Optica.
