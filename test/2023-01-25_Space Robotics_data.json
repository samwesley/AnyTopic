            "text": "One of the most remarkable things about construction robotics is the sheer breadth of tasks that can potentially be automated. As I\u2019ve noted before, the entire category is a prime target for robotics startups, given that it fills all of the big Ds of automation \u2014 dull, dirty and (quite often) dangerous. It\u2019s also one of those areas that have become increasingly difficult to staff, post-pandemic, even as construction work came roaring back.\n\nSo, if I\u2019m running a fairly successful company that makes construction robots, I\u2019m certainly thinking of diversification. The quickest way to jump start that is, of course, acquiring another, smaller startup. It\u2019s something I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing with increasing regularity as early-stage firms struggle to get funding to stay afloat amid a broadly stagnating VC market.\n\nBuilt Robotics, currently best known for its earth excavating autonomous heavy machine, Exosystem, announced today that it has acquired Roin Technologies (putting some of that fundraising to good use). The smaller firm is YC-backed, and best known for its concrete robots, which trowel and shoot (shotcrete) the stuff. In fact, Roin\u2019s URL already redirects to its parent company.\n\n\u201cSince their founding, Roin\u2019s team has pushed the boundaries of construction autonomy, which has created a unique expertise in our industry,\u201d Built Robotics founder and CEO Noah Ready-Campbell said in a release. \u201cWith Roin joining Built, the combined teams will continue developing new autonomous construction applications and customers can expect to see robotic applications expanding beyond earthmoving.\u201d\n\nRoin CEO Jim Delaney will be joining Built as part of the engineering team. He notes, \u201cWe see joining Built as the next step in Roin\u2019s story. I have always admired what Built has launched and how they\u2019ve moved the construction industry forward in adopting new technologies, and I am excited to have the opportunity to join their team.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t one of those cases of a one-to-one technology acquisition. Rather than being competitors, it seems the two construction systems can be potentially complementary, representing two distinct pieces of the broader construction puzzle.",

            "text": "The world's most powerful observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, has used its instrument to make a breakthrough discovery.\n\n3\n\nChamaeleon I\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES\n\nNASA has taken to its blog on its official website to announce that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), operated by an international team of astronomers, has discovered an inventory of the deepest, coldest ices measured to date. The space agency explains that knowledge of interstellar ice is very valuable as ices will be a crucial ingredient for building a habitable planet off Earth.\n\nThese ices contain vital elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Notably, these elements are key ingredients for a viable planetary atmosphere and molecules such as sugars, alcohols, and simple amino acids vital for life. Webb's sensitive instruments were pointed at the Chameleon I cloud located in the southern constellation of Chameleon, some 500 light-years away from Earth.\n\nThis stellar nursery is one of the closest star-forming regions to Earth, and for quite some time, researchers believed it featured holes in the sky referred to as 'dark molecular clouds' said to contain dense gas and dust that is so thick light emitted from stars behind them can't penetrate it. However, Webb's highly advanced infrared instruments are capable of piercing these thick regions of dust and gas, allowing astronomers for the first time to peer into regions of space they previously couldn't.\n\n\"We simply couldn't have observed these ices without Webb. The ices show up as dips against a continuum of background starlight. In regions that are this cold and dense, much of the light from the background star is blocked, and Webb's exquisite sensitivity was necessary to detect the starlight and therefore identify the ices in the molecular cloud,\" said Klaus Pontoppidan, Webb project scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, who was involved in this research.\n\nWith Webb's instruments, the astronomers were able to observe the dusty heart of Chameleon I and discovered ices in the early stages of star evolution. The discovered ices were measured and found to be at -440 degrees Fahrenheit, or -263 degrees Celsius, and were at the stage of star evolution right before the cloud collapses and forms a newly born protostar.\n\n3\n\nThese lines indicate which substances are present within the molecular cloud. These graphs show spectral data from three of the James Webb Space Telescope's instruments. In addition to simple ices like water, the science team was able to identify frozen forms of a wide range of molecules, from carbon dioxide, ammonia, and methane, to the simplest complex organic molecule, methanol.\n\nSo, how was this done? It was actually quite simple. Astronomers aligned Webb's instruments with two stars behind Chameleon I and used their light to light up the stellar nursery. Using Webb's infrared instruments, the observatory was able to identify the different molecules present within the cloud through their chemical fingerprints. The above image showcases dips in the wavelengths of observed infrared light, indicating specific molecules are present.",

            "text": "Augusta Prep teacher Eric Miller already knows how he and his students will use the school\u2019s new science and technology facility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to build a car,\u201d the school\u2019s motorsports engineering instructor said. \u201cWe build electric cars, so we\u2019ll build a fresh one when we get in, maybe build a motorcycle and whatever else they want to build; sky's the limit.\u201d\n\nFor Augusta Prep officials who broke ground Tuesday on the W. Rodger Giles Institute for Inquiry, the sky is literally the limit. The institute\u2019s astronaut logo, Head of School Derrick Willard said, helps symbolize the future of currently-enrolled Prep 2-year-olds who are slated to graduate in 2038, in a world that already includes NASA, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX rocket and China's space agency all working to send humans to Mars.\n\n\"In response to current and future challenges we can\u2019t even imagine, we have developed a vision for a unique future-facing sciences and engineering building that prepares our students for the workplaces of the future,\u201d Willard said.\n\nOn the drawing board:Science, technology at forefront for new center in works at Augusta Preparatory Day School\n\nThe institute is named for the Augusta-area restaurateur and commercial real estate investor who died in 2018 and bequeathed money to Prep to help establish the facility.\n\nThe two-story structure totaling about 19,000 square feet is designed to accommodate larger, more adaptive laboratory space for emerging classes at Prep such as robotics, engineering and computer science. The institute is expected to be completed by early 2024.\n\nThomas Burnside, who graduated from Prep in 1984, now is chairman of the school\u2019s Board of Trustees. He called Prep\u2019s faculty its \u201cgreatest asset\u201d that has been tasked with delivering quality education with \u201cinferior facilities\u201d that steadily show their age.\n\n\u201cNow I can say that because most of the science classes and labs that are in service here today were the very same ones that I learned in about 40 years ago back before we even had computers here,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say they\u2019re outdated may be a bit of an understatement, so we as a board determined and decided that it was time for our facilities to catch up with our curriculum. And today, we take a giant step forward in that process.\u201d\n\nThe school has raised $9.3 million from donors to pay for the building\u2019s complete construction, Prep Director of Development Pam Weinberger said. An additional $1.9 million is being raised to establish an endowment to maintain the institute.\n\nFounded in 1961, the private school moved to its current 50-acre Martinez campus on Flowing Wells Road in 1963.",

            "text": "Time-consuming, slow and expensive, tunnelling can delay and increase the costs of construction schemes \u2013 as seen with megaprojects such as Crossrail.\n\nIs there a better way of doing things? A way to avoid the pitfalls of previous projects and increase efficiency and speed? And are robots the answer?\n\nThe University of Birmingham has teamed up with a Hampshire-based start-up to examine the potential for robots to do just that.\n\nHyperTunnel, which successfully trialled building a 6-metre long structure for Network Rail using automated construction last year, is the firm involved in the research.\n\nIt believes that a method called \u2018swarm robotics\u2019 will dominate the underground construction in future.\n\nThe idea is that by utilising dozens or even thousands of small, simple robots and programming them to coordinate as a team, seemingly difficult tasks can be performed methodically and at speed.\n\nIn a similar way that bees or other insects work collectively towards a more complicated, common goal, the interconnected robots work together to bore a tunnel at multiple points simultaneously.\n\n\u201cThe power of the swarm means that the length and diameter of a tunnel are irrelevant [to construction times],\u201d HyperTunnel co-CEO and co-founder Jeremy Hammond tells Construction News.\n\nThe appeal of finding a way to circumvent the traditional method of starting at one end, often with a tunnel boring machine (TBM), and working at a slow pace to the other end, is obvious.\n\nHammond adds: \u201cThe only thing that changes [the length of time it takes] to construct a tunnel or any underground space is the number of robots that you put down there. So a 100-metre tunnel could and should take as long to build as a 5km tunnel. The only difference is how many robots you use.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to building the tunnel with HyperTunnel\u2019s method, a small-diameter pipe is first bored horizontally into the earth in the direction that the eventual tunnel will go. Once in place, HyperTunnel\u2019s robots are able to travel to a specific point along the pipe. They can then undertake a specific task, such as drilling at a perpendicular angle to the pipe and excavating cavities \u2013 and so over time expand the diameter of the holes \u2013 or take away spoil created by other robots.\n\nOnce the centre hole has been created, other holes are drilled around the circumference of the desired tunnel and the process is repeated. The remaining earth and rock is then taken out. Hammond likens it to turning a piece of cheddar into Swiss cheese.\n\nA memorandum of understanding signed with the University of Birmingham earlier this month aims to accelerate the development of the technology underpinning HyperTunnel. The university is home to the National Buried Infrastructure Facility (NBIF), which is part of the UK Collaboratorium for Research on Infrastructure and Cities (UKCRIC).\n\nUKCRIC is designed to stimulate research activities in the fields of infrastructure and cities through close collaboration between academia, industry and government. NBIF is currently leading research into areas such as soil-structure interaction, digital twinning, tunnelling and quantum-technology sensing.\n\n\n\nNicole Metje, professor of infrastructure monitoring at the university, says in a statement about the partnership: \u201cJoining forces with pioneering British organisations like HyperTunnel to expand our research and amplify our impact and theirs is exactly what we\u2019re about. This partnership is a significant milestone for NBIF.\u201d\n\nAs with many technology-led innovations, gaining industry confidence in HyperTunnel\u2019s solution will take time. For Hammond the next step is to work with Network Rail to help waterproof existing assets.\n\n\u201cNetwork Rail has something like 650 tunnels and they leak like crazy,\u201d Hammond says. \u201cIf there is water coming in from below ground you can create spillways to manage it, but if groundwater comes from above it\u2019s very hard to stop.\u201d\n\nHyperTunnel\u2019s plan is to build a network of small pipe-sized tunnels above any existing asset then join them together to create an umbrella of waterproof material over the existing tunnel lining.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re effectively building a tunnel around the outside of an existing tunnel, which removes the the groundwater access to the tunnel from above \u2013 it effectively puts an umbrella above it. That is a capability we have now,\u201d he adds.\n\nOne big question for construction firms is whether HyperTunnel\u2019s methods might put contractors that work in tunnelling out of a job?\n\nHammond is quick to explain that the start-up\u2019s aim is to work alongside industry partners on projects, not win contracts independently.\n\nHyperTunnel is currently working with contractors on Network Rail\u2019s civils frameworks, and is in discussions over exclusive distribution agreements both in the UK and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe are not contracting directly with Network Rail but partnering with contractors who are going to deliver solutions to Network Rail,\u201d Hammond adds. \u201cContractors do what they do much better than us. We\u2019re not trying to compete with contractors, we are delivering options and solutions to them.\u201d",

The spacecraft was powered on and connected to ground support equipment, enabling engineers and technicians to prepare it for launch in 2023. Teams working at Astrotech and at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California continue to monitor the health of its systems.\n\nAfter a one-year delay to complete critical testing, the Psyche project is targeting an October 2023 launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. NASA's Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) technology demonstration, testing high-data-rate laser communications, is integrated into Psyche and will travel with it when it launches to its target, a metal-rich asteroid, also named Psyche, that lies in the main asteroid belt. The silver-colored cylinder shown in the photo is the sunshade for DSOC, and the gold blanketing is the aperture cover for the DSOC payload.\n\nThe spacecraft's target may be the partial core of a planetesimal, a building block of rocky planets in our solar system. Researchers will study Psyche using a suite of instruments including multispectral cameras, a Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) and a magnetometer. The GRNS and magnetometer sensors are visible in the photo as the tips of the two black protrusions at the far end of the spacecraft. Also visible is the large, disc-shaped high-gain antenna, which will enable the spacecraft to communicate with Earth.\n\nThe Psyche mission is led by Arizona State University. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, is responsible for the mission's overall management, system engineering, integration and test, and mission operations. Maxar Technologies in Palo Alto, California, is providing the high-power solar electric propulsion spacecraft chassis. DSOC is managed by JPL for the Technology Demonstration Missions program within NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate and the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program within the agency's Space Operations Mission Directorate. NASA's Launch Services Program, based at the Kennedy Space Center, is managing the launch service. Psyche is part of NASA's Discovery Program, managed by the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nFor more information about the Psyche mission, visit:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/psyche\n\nhttps://psyche.asu.edu/",

            "text": "In 2022, NASA-developed Search and Rescue technologies enabled rescue personnel to save 397 lives in the U.S. region. Since 1979, NASA has provided technical expertise to the Cospas-Sarsat program, the international satellite-aided search and rescue effort. This technical expertise has led to the development of multiple emergency location beacon types.\n\nThe international search and rescue effort enables hikers, boaters, pilots, and other explorers to activate location beacons should they become distressed or lost. Adventurers can utilize 406 MHz frequency Cospas-Sarsat beacons, which equip users with precise and reliable emergency location services. Upon activation, these beacons send signals to satellites in space, which then relay the distress signals to ground stations. This process allows the Cospas-Sarsat network to calculate their position anywhere in the world. The network then sends the location to first responders, who initiate rescue operations.\n\nThese beacons enable explorers with a sense of safety as they venture on land, air, and sea. There are three types of beacons available for users: Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs), used by hikers and other land explorers; Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs), for boaters and sailors; and Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELT) for aircraft pilots.\n\nIn 2022, 80 rescues were made for activated PLBs; 275 for EPIRBs; and 42 for ELTs.\n\nThe Search and Rescue (SAR) office is part of the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) portfolio and will be essential for NASA\u2019s endeavor to the Moon and Mars. On December 11, 2022, Search and Rescue team members on the USS Portland used a newly-developed Search and Rescue Intelligent Terminal (SAINT) to track the Artemis I Orion capsule as it re-entered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean after a 25-day journey to the Moon and back.\n\nThis technology will be essential for future crewed missions to the Moon. Astronauts on Artemis II and beyond will be equipped with Advanced Next-Generation Emergency Locator (ANGEL) beacons, which will allow NASA to locate astronauts in the event they need to egress from the Orion capsule after splashdown or during a launch abort scenario.\n\nEarth-based beacon development is not the only service provided by NASA\u2019s Search and Rescue office. In addition to supporting the Artemis program, the Search and Rescue office is working toward the establishment of lunar search and rescue, or LunaSAR, which will provide distress location services for crewed and robotic missions on the lunar surface. This service is in coordination with NASA\u2019s LunaNet architecture, which will extend internet-like capabilities to the Moon. LunaSAR and LunaNet will work in tandem to sustain a human presence on the Moon.\n\nThe SAR office has a unique portfolio that advances NASA\u2019s exploration missions while saving the lives of terrestrial explorers. The 397 individuals saved by the Cospas-Sarsat network are a testament to the life-saving power of NASA innovation and expertise.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manages the U.S. network region for Cospas-Sarsat, which relies on flight and ground technologies originally developed at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. NASA\u2019s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program at NASA Headquarters provides strategic oversight to the SAR office. U.S. saves are made by the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Air Force, and many other local rescue authorities.",

            "text": "Asteroid mining startup AstroForge will head to space twice this year, as it attempts to do what no other company has been able to before: unlock the potentially limitless value of precious minerals in deep space.\n\nWhen TechCrunch covered AstroForge\u2019s seed round last April, we noted that the company was planning a demonstration mission sometime this year. Today, AstroForge released more details on that mission, plus announced an additional mission later in the year that will take the company to a target asteroid for observation.\n\nThe first mission will launch in April aboard SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-7 rideshare launch. The 6U CubeSat, which is being provided by space tech company OrbAstro, will be pre-loaded with \u201casteroid-like material\u201d to demonstrate AstroForge\u2019s refining and extraction capabilities in the zero-gravity environment. The second mission will see the company head into deep space, to gather data on the surface of an asteroid the company hopes to mine later in the decade.\n\n\u201cWe have to find some way to go get the regolith off the asteroid and process it in our refinery, and we believe we\u2019ve solved that for our target asteroid,\u201d CEO Matt Gialich said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nHe said the company is working with advisors from universities, NASA and the research nonprofit Planetary Science Institute to help identify the most promising asteroids to exploit. The company also recently published a paper with the Colorado School of Mines evaluating the metal content on asteroids that could be mined and sold as commodities on Earth or used in-space.\n\nThat paper noted that \u201ctextures of metal-rich asteroid surfaces remain to be investigated,\u201d and Gialich confirmed that the second mission will be to study the surface of the target asteroid using high-resolution images. He declined to provide much more information about the asteroid, other than that it is closer to home than, say, a rock in the asteroid belt that\u2019s between Mars and Jupiter.\n\n\u201cThe asteroid belts, they\u2019re far away, they would take us like 14-year round trips,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is much better suited for research and exploration. [\u2026] That\u2019s not a viable business case for us.\u201d\n\nInstead, the company will be hitching a ride to lunar orbit with Houston-based Intuitive Machines before moving on to deep space. AstroForge\u2019s spacecraft, again being supplied by OrbAstro, will head on a much shorter 11-month journey to the target asteroid.\n\nAstroForge is actively planning its third mission to land on the asteroid, and the fourth mission, which would be the company\u2019s first refining mission to bring platinum back to Earth.",

            "text": "A trio of engineers has developed a smart cane that provides navigation assistance with warning vibrations and spoken directions, enhancing the independence of people with blindness or visual impairments by helping them find a seat in a public space or the right products in a grocery store, among others.\n\nThe team\u2019s smart cane looks like ordinary ones that can be bought at local department stores but with a few additions: a camera, sensors, and vibrational motors powered by a backpack-mounted laptop. This system leverages technology to perform 1) simultaneous localization, mapping (SLAM), and object localization; 2) goal disambiguation and scoring; and 3) path planning and guidance.\n\n\u201cGoal-based navigation in public places is critical for independent mobility and for breaking barriers that exist for blind or visually impaired people in a sight-centric society,\u201d said the engineers from the University of Colorado Boulder in Boulder, Colorado, US, led by Shivendra Agrawal, a doctoral student in the Department of Computer Science.\n\n\u201cThrough this work we present a proof-of-concept system that autonomously leverages goal-based navigation assistance and perception to identify socially preferred seats and safely guide its user towards them in unknown indoor environments,\u201d they added.\n\nBest place to sit\n\nIn a pilot user study, Agrawal and colleagues conducted experiments to test the usefulness of the smart cane in terms of locating a seat in a caf\u00e9. The team set up a makeshift caf\u00e9 that had several chairs, patrons, and a few obstacles.\n\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re in a caf\u00e9. You don\u2019t want to sit just anywhere. You usually take a seat close to the walls to preserve your privacy, and you usually don't like to sit face-to-face with a stranger,\u201d Agrawal pointed out, adding that this concern is a priority of people who are blind or visually impaired.\n\nThen, wearing blindfolds, participants without visual impairments picked up their smart cane and strapped on a backpack that held the laptop that powered the walking device. The device helped the participants navigate the caf\u00e9 and successfully find the right chair in 10 out of 12 trials with varying levels of difficulty. [IEEE Int Conf Intell Robots Syst 2022;doi:10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981219]\n\nRight grocery item to buy\n\nIn another experiment, the team set up a makeshift grocery shelf stocked with multiple varieties of cereal. In line with this, the smart cane was modified for a task that required locating and grabbing things in aisles filled with dozens of products that were comparable in appearance and feel. A database of product photos, including boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios or Apple Jacks, was also created onto a software.\n\nThe idea was to allow the walking stick to scan the shelf, evaluate the available products, and pinpoint the specific item that the user wanted to buy.\n\n\u201cIt assigns a score to the objects present, selecting what is the most likely product. Then, the system issues commands like \u2018move a little bit to your left\u2019,\u201d Agrawal said.\n\nA powerful enabler\n\nThe results of the second experiment have yet to be released, but Agrawal and colleagues believe that their smart cane would increase its user\u2019s confidence in independent navigation and enable them to freely engage in socially dynamic situations like seat choice and grocery shopping.\n\nIt will take some time before the smart cane becomes available commercially and reaches the hands of blind and visually impaired individuals, they said. In the meantime, the team is looking to make the device more compact, such that it can run with a standard smartphone attached to a cane rather than with a laptop in a backpack.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to make this technology mature but also attract other researchers into this field of assistive robotics,\u201d Agrawal said. \u201cWe think assistive robotics has the potential to change the world.\u201d\n\nThe study was presented at the 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) held in Kyoto, Japan.",

            "text": "Since Sarcos Robotics acquired RE2 Robotics for $100 million in spring 2022, effectively taking it public, the two companies have faced the challenge of becoming a cohesive unit, mission first.\n\nLast year was spent figuring out how RE2\u2019s Pittsburgh team and Sarcos\u2019 Salt Lake City employees were going to work together, Sarcos Chief Operating Officer Jorgen Pedersen told this reporter during a tour of the facilities. Pedersen, RE2\u2019s founder and former CEO, explained that despite the new name, the company\u2019s goal has remained the same: to create robots that assist with \u201cinjury prone\u201d jobs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to go into the world, whether that be in a construction site, or out onto a tarmac, and help workers do their jobs more safely,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cThat\u2019s what drew Sarcos to us. We were aligned in our vision, so at the time of acquisition, nothing had to change, really.\u201d\n\nAway from the restaurants and tattoo shops in Lawrenceville, before the acquisition, the company was already undergoing a lot of changes. Pedersen recalled that since 2020, the RE2 staff in Pittsburgh has doubled from 50 to 100. During that time, the company also expanded to two new buildings in the neighborhood. Still, due to a lack of space while the company searches for a fourth location, some of the employees have continued working remotely. That is, with the exception of engineers and manufacturers.\n\n\u201cDuring the design phase, you can be anywhere if you\u2019re just writing code, but during the test phase you need to be on site,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cCOVID changed the world.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s being built in the Lawrenceville facilities? If you walked in, you could see engineers working on the O-AMPP, a robotics system for solar field construction through a partnership with JLG Industries that began before the Sarcos acquisition. Although it\u2019s still a work in progress, by the time it\u2019s finished, the hope is that it\u2019ll leave the heavy lifting involved in placing solar panels to the robot and ease the physical burden for human workers.\n\nPedersen believes that RE2 and Sarcos\u2019 shared desire to make jobs that range from mundane to hazardous safer and more efficient is why the two companies fit together so well.\n\n\u201cWe had complementary technologies,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cThey had more anthropomorphic technologies and exoskeletons, we had more mobile manipulation technologies. So when the worlds came together, it was just a nice dovetail of capabilities, which was not only additive, it multiplied our capability.\u201d\n\nScattered throughout the Sarcos buildings are robots that chart the company\u2019s history before and after the acquisition. Lined up under news clippings that explain their significance are smaller machines that were produced when Carnegie Mellon University was RE2\u2019s biggest customer. The machines also show when the company shifted over to robots constructed to suit the Department of Defense\u2019s needs in 2005.\n\nNow the company divides its work between commercial and defense and is constantly looking to hire engineers to keep up with the demand for its products. No employees from Salt Lake City have transferred to the Pittsburgh location, so most of its hires come from the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to hire in Pittsburgh because the talent pool is larger,\u201d Pedersen said.\n\nHe added that he believes that was a part of the draw for Sarcos. Furthermore, due to so much of the hardware being made here, Salt Lake City employees travel to Pittsburgh more than in the reverse (though Pedersen himself ventures to Salt Lake City at least once a quarter).\n\nAll the same, Pedersen says that nearly a year after the acquisition was finalized, the engineering teams can work together collaboratively on projects.\n\n\u201cThe engineering teams are coming together and starting to jointly develop technology,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Pittsburgh and it\u2019s not just Salt Lake City, it\u2019s everyone together.\u201d\n\n-30-",

            "text": "Galileo Service\n\nGalileo\u2019s capabilities have grown with the addition of a new High Accuracy Service, freely available worldwide to anyone with a suitably equipped receiver.\n\nDelivering horizontal accuracy down to 20 cm and vertical accuracy of 40 cm, the High Accuracy Service is enabled through an additional level of real-time positioning corrections, delivered through a new data stream within the existing Galileo signal.\n\nFollowing months of testing by ESA engineers at the ESTEC technical centre in the Netherlands, Galileo\u2019s High Accuracy Service (HAS) was officially declared available to users at the European Space Conference in Brussels, Belgium, today.\n\n\u201cGalileo is not standing still,\u201d remarks Javier Benedicto, ESA Director of Navigation. \u201cThis new High Accuracy Service offers a new dimension of precision to everyone who needs it, while the Open Service Navigation Message Authentication \u2013 already available \u2013 allows users to authenticate Galileo signals as they make use of it, to minimise any risk of spoofing. And an upgraded integrity message of the signal rolled out last year reduces the time to first fix while enhancing the overall robustness of Galileo.\n\n\u201cESA\u2019s role is to oversee such fundamental upgrades to the Galileo system, working in conjunction with Galileo\u2019s service provider EUSPA, the EU Agency for the Space Programmme, and its owner, the European Union. Further service improvements will come with the launch of the remaining Galileo satellites, followed later this decade by Galileo Second Generation.\u201d\n\nThe new HAS correction message is embedded within the \u2018E6\u2019 band of the Galileo signal \u2013 typically not accessed via smartphones and other mass-market products but only through high-end receivers. However this message is also being made available through the internet, opening the prospect of wider adoption by connected devices, and its development into the Open Service standard in years to come.\n\nAlready the world\u2019s best\n\nEurope\u2019s Galileo system \u2013 comprising a 28-satellite constellation to date and a worldwide ground segment \u2013 is already the world\u2019s most precise satellite navigation service, with its Open Service offering metre-scale accuracy. The European Union and ESA went into partnership to develop Galileo, with ESA as its technical authority \u2013 this year the Agency celebrates the 30th anniversary of its first satellite navigation research.\n\nEUSPA is targeting this new Galileo service towards current high-precision applications such as precision agriculture, resource prospecting, land and hydrographic surveys as well as emerging sectors such as robotics, autonomous driving of automobiles, trains, ships and drones and augmented reality gaming and marketing \u2013 even formation flying of satellites.\n\n\u201cWith this new High Accuracy Service, Galileo becomes the first constellation able to provide a high-accuracy service globally and directly through the signal in space and via internet,\u201d comments Rodrigo da Costa, Executive Director of EUSPA. \u201cThis new feature for Galileo will foster innovation in many downstream sectors.\u201d\n\nKeeping Galileo on track\n\nThe basic principle behind Galileo is simple. The satellites in space transmit signals incorporating a highly-precise time measurement, exact to a few billionths of a second. A receiver picks up signals from four (or more) Galileo satellites and measures the time it took for each signal to reach it. It then converts these time values into distance by multiplying the figures by the speed of light. The receiver then cross-checks the distances from all satellites to pinpoint its location on (or above) Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nBut in practice both the orbits of the satellites themselves and the onboard atomic clocks that keep time for the signals are prone to drift. And the signals can experience varying levels of slight delay due to interference from the \u2018ionosphere\u2019 \u2013 an electrically active segment of Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nSo to keep the system on track, a global network of Galileo Sensor Stations performs continuous monitoring of the satellites and their signals. Their data is used to compile a set of corrections which are then uplinked to the Galileo satellites to be incorporated into their navigation signals every 100 minutes or so.\n\nThink of Galileo as a single planetary-scale clock, designed to be sufficiently accurate that it identifies and highlights any errors that build up over time.\n\nFaster corrections for sharper precision\n\nThe new HAS further improves on this performance through the use of a High Accuracy Data Generator based at the Galileo Control Centre in Fucino, Italy, generating additional corrections for Galileo as well as US GPS satellites. These corrections are then relayed to compatible receivers in real time through the Galileo satellite signal \u2013 compiled into a single message of 448 bits per second, a unique capability of the carefully-engineered Galileo signal shape.\n\n\u201cCompared to the Galileo Open Service, the corrections are made available very rapidly and very often \u2013 with an update for satellite orbits every 30 seconds and for satellite clocks every 10 seconds,\u201d explains ESA\u2019s Galileo System Performance Engineer Daniel Blonksi. \u201cAnd the HAS correction message is designed in such a way that suitable receivers can benefit from multiple satellites broadcasting it, to reconstruct the overall message very fast.\u201d\n\nThe new high-accuracy service is envisaged as having two service levels. Service Level 1, already available, corrects satellite orbit and clock errors as well as internal signal \u2018biases\u2019 unique to each satellite in the constellation that, once known, can enable still higher precision through direct comparisons of their signal phase.\n\nService Level 2, intended for roll out across Europe, will combine these with additional ionospheric corrections, made possible by the use of additional ground stations for which ESA is preparing the needed infrastructure upgrades.\n\nAbout Galileo\n\nGalileo is currently the world\u2019s most precise satellite navigation system, serving more than three billion users around the globe.\n\nThe Full Operational Capability phase of the Galileo programme is managed and funded by the European Union. The European Commission, ESA and EUSPA (the EU Agency for the Space Programme) have signed an agreement by which ESA acts as design authority and system development prime on behalf of the Commission and EUSPA as the exploitation and operation manager of Galileo/EGNOS. \u201cGalileo\u201d is registered as a trademark in the database of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (n\u00b0 002742237).",
