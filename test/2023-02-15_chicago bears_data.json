Sign up for NBC Chicago newsletters.\n\n\"I'm excited for free agency. I love the Bears. I love the organization. I love how the city treated me,\" Montgomery said on FanDuel TV. \"They got a good thing going over there and I hope I'll be back.\"\n\nWhen asked about other teams that pique his interest in free agency, Montgomery kept it vague, seemingly focused on sticking with his current team.\n\n\"I really just try to see where I'm at right now,\" Montgomery said. \"Not trying to look too far ahead. I try to just take it one day at a time and be present with where I am, be where my feet are.\"\n\nMontgomery was drafted by the Bears in the third round of the 2019 NFL draft by the former general manager, Ryan Pace. Montgomery was notorious for breaking tackles in college, leading the NCAA in that category his junior year.\n\nSince joining the Bears in 2019, he's racked up over 3,600 rushing yards and 30 total touchdowns. He's recorded one 1,000-yard rushing season, and has punched in over 1,000 yards from scrimmage every season he's played with the Bears.\n\nHowever, there is the possibility the Bears don't sign back their starting running back going forward. Seeing as today's NFL doesn't call for a higher workload from one running back, and considering the Bears have a stud back in Khalil Herbert, Montgomery might not return to Chicago.\n\nMontgomery could be looking for a long-term deal of approximately around $10 million per year, and the front office will have to determine whether or not that number is too big for their britches.\n\nRELATED: Montgomery wants to stick with Bears: 'I love playing here'\n\nAs aforementioned, Herbert had a standout season with the Bears. He rushed for 731 yards and four touchdowns alongside Montgomery, finishing fourth in the NFL for yards per rushing attempt last season (5.4 yards). Herbert has two seasons to go on his rookie deal, making him a cheap, yet effective option at running back.\n\nThe future for Montgomery and his ties to the Bears remain in question. But, rest assured, Montgomery isn't worried about entering his first career free agency.\n\n\"God got everything worked out for me, wherever I'm supposed to be. So I'm excited for whatever's next,\" Montgomery said.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "The 2023 NFL Draft could be absolute mayhem with the number of teams at or near the top who could desperately be vying for a quarterback. The Chicago Bears hold all the power for now, and it seems they could indeed be looking to trigger all that chaos.\n\nThe organization is looking to trade the No. 1 pick for a good haul and still snag an impactful player a bit further down the board. \u201cChicago has the chance to trade back and still get a blue-chip defensive talent, a move many evaluators believe Chicago will execute,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler reported.\n\nThe Bears\u2019 front office should be flooded with offers in light of this information, if it isn\u2019t already. The franchise has a big decision to make regarding the future of quarterback Justin Fields, who is under contract for at least two more years. He made definite strides with head coach Matt Eberflus at the helm and was at times unstoppable as a rusher (160 carries for 1,143 yards and eight touchdowns).\n\nFields still has work to do in the passing game and must clean up the turnovers. If the Bears are willing to be patient, however, then they will be able to leverage several other teams against one another. The Houston Texans (No. 2 pick), Indianapolis Colts (No. 4), Las Vegas Raiders (No. 7) and Carolina Panthers (No. 9) could all be considering making a move for what is generally considered the most important building block of an NFL franchise.\n\nThis year\u2019s QB class has gotten mixed reviews and is highlighted by Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Will Levis. Chicago second-year general manager Ryan Poles could then be targeting an SEC powerhouse either in defensive tackle Jalen Carter from Georgia or Alabama edge-rusher Will Anderson Jr. Both players would be welcome additions for a defense that allowed the most points per game in the league (27.2).\n\nIt could be an exciting NFL Draft for fans, and a stressful one for multiple executives. Everyone must now wait for the first domino to fall. The Bears are on the clock.",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears need to build up their entire defensive line. They will have to look to the NFL draft. Is South Carolina defensive lineman Zacch Pickens a name that they need to watch for?\n\nChicago Bears Draft Profile: South Carolina Defensive Line Zacch Pickens\n\nZacch Pickens was a five-star recruit coming out of high school and was considered a big signing for the Gamecocks. He got onto the field as a freshman in a rotational role. About halfway through his sophomore year, Zacch Pickens got the starting role, and never looked back. He became a trusted staple of the South Carolina defense in both 2021 and 2022.\n\nZacch Pickens has played 1,834 snaps. He has lined up as a nose 15% of the time, a 3-technique 80% and he lined up outside the tackle on 5% of his snaps while at South Carolina. In that time he has 41 pressures, and 61 run stops, with 19 pressures, and 22 run stops coming last season.\n\nZacch Pickens\u2019 strengths and weaknesses\n\nOne of the best traits that Zacch Pickens possesses is his first step. Het gets off of the football quickly and can take a hard step into the backfield that helps him drive the interior lineman back. Pickens does a great job overpowering centers when he gets lined up over them because he can beat them out of their stance.\n\nThis helps push pockets but also gets him into the backfield as a run defender.\n\nThere are some areas where he can improve. Pickens does not use his hands enough, and relies on his speed and beating linemen into gaps by processing the run. If he does get held up on his initial rush, he often just runs out of gas and remains ineffective.\n\nPickens also may be a better pass rusher than run defender. His run defense can be more hit or miss, and there are times when he loses the leverage battle.\n\nShould Chicago Bears draft Zacch Pickens?\n\nWhen you are talking about an SEC defensive lineman who had a decent week at the Senior Bowl, it is a player who should be on the Chicago Bears\u2019 radar. If the team does not take Jalen Carter with their top pick, this would be a great consolation prize. One of the big questions they have to ask is Will Anderson and someone like Pickens, or Carter, and an edge rusher in this spot.\n\nZacch Pickens has a profile that could put him into a role similar to Justin Jones. As a rookie, he could be the backup three-technique behind Jones, and then slowly ascend over him if he can continue to develop his pass rush game.",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears will either be re-signing David Montgomery or will be adding a new running back in free agency or the draft. While so many fans want the team to go big or go home, the reality is that they need a complement to Khalil Herbert more than they need a do-everything type of runner.\n\nSome of the biggest traits that David Montgomery brought to highlight Herbert were the ability to move the chains in short-yardage situations, be a reliable pass catcher, and pass blocker. The question is less about how much can the team spend to replace him, and more about how can they get that skill set at a cheaper rate than Montgomery, who may get paid like a do-everything back.\n\n6. If Chicago Bears spend on a running back, it should be Jamaal Williams\n\nIf the Chicago Bears spend on a running back, it should not even be David Montgomery, it should be Jamaal Williams. Okay, that is a little hyperbolic because Jamaal Williams will probably not get a deal as big as Montgomery. Montgomery can do a little bit more than Williams, but Williams can do is everything Chicago needs.\n\nKhalil Hebert is a big play waiting to happen. They do not want to get him injured pounding him between the tackles and is much better on stretch zone rushes anyways. So, Jamaal Williams can come in as the power back who grinds between the tackles. No one was better near the goal line, and converting those third and shorts.\n\nBeyond that, he is a great pass protector, which is where Herbert struggles. Jamaal Williams signed for $3M per year last year, and his projected salary is around $4M this year. The Chicago Bears could throw him a few extra, lock him in for $6M, and that is still less than almost any projection for Montgomery by a decent bit. For the role, and the money this is how the Chicago Bears need to invest in running back.\n\n!\u2014pageview_candidate\u2014>",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears have several missions ahead of them, a crucial one being to get value on every dollar of the $100 million or so they will spend this coming year.\n\nSome of that will be drafting the right player at, or near, the top of the draft. Some will be choosing the right free agents to whom the team will offer massive contracts. And some will be getting rid of bad money that is already on the roster.\n\nIt is hard to say that Chicago is spending a worse $4.5 million anywhere than the salary cap hit represented by kicker Cairo Santos in 2023. The Bears can save $3 million against the cap by parting ways Santos, who was arguably the worst volume kicker in the NFL last season.\n\nAs such, Brad Spielberger of Pro Football Focus on Tuesday, February 14, named Santos the most likely cut candidate on the team\u2019s roster this offseason.\n\nSantos Losing Range, Posted Poor Numbers For Bears Last Season\n\nSpielberger\u2019s argument for moving on from Santos boils down to a horrendous 2022 for the kicker, per PFF\u2019s analytics, as well as the fact that the aging specialist is losing range at a time when field goals are regularly being made from 60 yards and beyond.\n\nA team is never going to pay a player more than their on-field production warrants, no matter their financial standing, but the Bears are devoid of talent and have a ton of cash/cap at their disposal \u2014 which, in theory, could protect some of the cheaper veterans on the roster. That said, veteran kicker Cairo Santos missed five extra points and two field goals in 2022, earning him a 48.5 kicking grade that ranked dead last among 34 kickers with at least 10 attempts. Furthermore, while Santos has been quite accurate and consistent as a Bear, his range at this point is effectively 53 or so yards, with a handful of kickers across the NFL hitting from 10 yards beyond that. The Bears might as well get a jump start on looking into long-term, younger solutions at kicker for 2023.\n\nSantos, who will be entering the 10th season of his NFL career next year, joined the Bears in 2020. He has missed eight field goals and seven extra point attempts during that span, per Pro Football Reference.\n\nBears Advised to Cut Lucas Patrick, Justin Jones This Offseason\n\nA couple other prominent cut candidates in Chicago are offensive lineman Lucas Patrick and defensive tackle Justin Jones.\n\nPatrick suffered through injury issues last year and could be a cap casualty because he represents $5.4 million in potential savings and the Bears are probably going to look for multiple upgrades along the offensive line.\n\nJones is also at risk because the defensive line will be a top priority in Chicago this offseason and parting ways with the tackle can save the Bears $7.4 million.",

            "text": "The Super Bowl is over. This is where the real fun begins for Chicago Bears fans. Around this time every year, the rumors start flying about the upcoming NFL draft. Since they hold the #1 overall pick, it\u2019s only natural the Bears would be the focal point. Most discussions center around whether GM Ryan Poles will trade the pick. It makes sense. Chicago is in rebuild mode. More picks would help move that process further. The best way to do that is by auctioning off the first pick to the highest bidder. For that to happen, they need help from the 2023 quarterback class.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay lit the fuse on that powder keg when he openly stated his team intended to draft a quarterback. Not only that, but he also heavily implied interest in Alabama star Bryce Young. NFL insider Benjamin Allbright shed some light on those statements by dropping two significant hints about what\u2019s really going on.\n\n1. Young is not the QB Irsay actually wants.\n\n2. Houston is expected to select Young at #2 overall.\n\nIrsay trying to get conversation started for teams to trade ahead of him for Young if the Texans don't take him (they will), and not mentioning the QB he wants is fun\u2026 \u2014 Benjamin Allbright (@AllbrightNFL) February 14, 2023\n\nIf not Young, then who might the Colts owner covet?\n\nCurrent rumblings are that Kentucky quarterback Will Levis is quietly climbing boards. Both Pro Football Focus and local Chicago insider David Kaplan echoed the same thing. There is a growing belief he could be the first quarterback taken, and it likely will be at #1 overall. This may surprise some, considering the hype around Young and Ohio State standout C.J. Stroud. In truth, Levis is the most talented quarterback in the class. Many have compared him to Josh Allen. He has that kind of size and arm strength.\n\nAccording to @PFF the \u201cbiggest draft rumor\u201d coming out of the Super Bowl is that Will Levis is passing Bryce Young as QB1 for many teams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing Will Levis number 1 overall.\u201d #Bears #NFLDraft2023 \u2014 Ben Devine (@Chicago_NFL) February 14, 2023\n\nThe Chicago Bears can also see what Irsay is doing.\n\nPoles isn\u2019t dumb. He\u2019s played the lying season game before. If anything, the owner\u2019s lack of subtlety did more harm than good. Now everybody knows Young is almost sure not to be the quarterback Indianapolis wants. GM Chris Ballard is known for being a \u201ctraits\u201d guy. When drafting a player, he will bet on elite physical traits. If that holds true, then Levis is the obvious target. Every team knows they\u2019ll have to get in front of at least the Colts at #4 to have a shot at him. While Allbright says the Texans are eyeing Young, things can change. If those teams fear Houston may opt for Levis instead, then there is only one course of action.\n\nThey must get the Chicago Bears #1 pick. It\u2019s a reminder of how complex draft season truly is. Poles must play his cards carefully. One misstep can lead to whatever market he may have for the pick falling apart. Thus far, he has done well. He has committed one way or another to anything, leaving all doors open. He even admitted there is a possibility the Bears could trade Justin Fields and take a quarterback at #1. That sense of the unknown often drives other teams to get aggressive in trades.",

            "summary": "The NFL draft has officially kicked off with the Super Bowl ending and Chicago Bears fans are in for a wild ride as GM Ryan Poles considers trading their #1 overall pick. Rumors have been swirling that Kentucky quarterback Will Levis is climbing boards, while Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay's lack of subtlety has made it clear he wants to trade up for Bryce Young if Houston doesn't take him first. It remains to be seen how this will all play out, but one thing is certain - GM Chris Ballard and other teams must get in front of the Colts at #4 if they want a shot at Levis."

            "text": "Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay indicated that he certainly wouldn\u2019t mind the team selecting Alabama\u2019s Bryce Young in the NFL Draft. Irsay would definitely enjoy ClutchPoints\u2019 latest mock then, as writer Mike Johrendt predicted that the Colts would trade for the Chicago Bears\u2019 no. 1 pick and select Young in the NFL Draft.\n\n\u201cOur first trade of the 2023 NFL Draft sees the Indianapolis Colts move up and select their QB of the future: Alabama\u2019s Bryce Young. One of the most polished QBs in recent memory, Young has a well-established skill set that the Colts would love to pair with Jonathan Taylor, giving new head coach Shane Steichen a young QB to mold and finally turn this offense into a unit capable of keeping up with their division.\u201d\n\nClutchPoints\u2019 Johrendt has the Colts pulling off a blockbuster trade with the Bears for the first pick, selecting Bryce Young, the 2021 Heisman Trophy winner out of Alabama.\n\nThe Bears, who seem to be set at the quarterback position with Justin Fields, will reportedly do their \u201chomework\u201d on the signal-callers available in the NFL Draft.\n\nBut the most likely bet would be that Chicago trades the pick- and why not to a team like the Colts, whose owner expressed interest in Young.\n\nAs Johrendt notes, the Colts would have an offense loaded with young playmakers in Young, Jonathan Taylor and Michael Pittman Jr, music to new head coach Shane Steichen\u2019s ears.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bears land Young\u2019s Alabama teammate, Will Anderson, with the Colts\u2019 fourth overall pick.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly an intriguing NFL Mock Draft scenario, one that both fanbases of the Colts and Bears would gladly sign up for.",

            "text": "Ryan Poles will keep Justin Fields in loop on offseason moves originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago\n\nThe NFL offseason has barely started and there is already an unbearable amount of debate about whether the Chicago Bears should or shouldn't trade quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nThe majority of pundits, analysts and NFL people saying you don't trade Fields.\n\nBut Fields is a person and the constant discussion would weigh on anyone.\n\nThe Bears need to give off the impression they could take a quarterback to keep the value of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft high, and to keep pressure on teams that need a quarterback who might want to make a trade. That includes going to pro days for top draft-eligible quarterbacks and those appearances will only further the speculation and debate.\n\nIn order to alleviate some of the stress of this offseason, Bears general manager Ryan Poles is planning to keep Fields in the loop on all moves.\n\n\u201dIt doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d Fields told FanSided's Matt Verderame on Friday. \u201cRyan actually texted me yesterday and just said he was gonna keep me in the loop with everything. It doesn't bother me whatsoever.\n\n\"But you know, I just try to focus on the things that I can control. If I do go somewhere else, my approach towards the game is going to stay the same. How I work, that\u2019s going to stay the same. Just control what I can control.\u201d\n\nA couple quick thoughts.\n\nFirst, some might scoff at the notion of a front office keeping a third-year quarterback so in the loop, but I think it's wise. The Bears need to do certain things to drive the price of the No. 1 overall pick up and motivate teams to make a deal, if they want to trade it as many believe they do.\n\nThat includes working out quarterback prospects and going to their pro days. Those news nuggets coming out can have a positive impact on trade talks but will also lead to rumors and debate that could have an adverse affect on your franchise quarterback.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpen and clear communication between Poles and Fields is the only way to mitigate it.\n\nIt's also an area that Poles has said he needs to improve after contract negotiations with linebacker Roquan Smith and trade rumors surrounding offensive lineman Tevin Jenkins. It seems like he might still\n\n\"I just think I can always communicate better,\" Poles said at the time. \"I think we all can just communicate better and be more clear. I think that\u2019s been pretty good but there\u2019s always room to improve, I guess.\"\n\nAnd it looks like Poles is trying to be a better communicator, but still has work to do.\n\nThe day before Fields spoke to FanSided, he went on the Rich Eisen show and said he'd like to be kept in the loop if the Bears bring in players for work outs. And Fields told FanSided Poles texted him he'd keep him the loop on Thursday.\n\n\"I think everybody would love honesty in the process,\" Fields told Eisen. \"So I would definitely like to know that. And it's a business, so totally understand. No hard feelings.\"\n\nLooks like Fields got his wish.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "Hey, Bears fans. We heard y\u2019all liked mock drafts, and y\u2019all really liked first-round trades. So we looked around and found you a new mock draft for you from NFL.com that features not one, not two, but THREE first-round trades for GM Ryan Poles. Best part, the Bears still land one of the top defensive prospects after all the wheeling and dealing.\n\nThings start with the Bears trading the No. 1 pick to the Texans in exchange for the No. 2 pick, plus two picks from the DeShaun Watson trade: a 2023 third-rounder and a 2024 first-rounder. The Texans use that pick to select Bryce Young.\n\nFrom there, Poles gets right back on the phone and flips the No. 2 pick to the Colts in exchange for No. 4, a second-round pick, plus a 2024 second-rounder and a 2024 third-rounder. The Colts select C.J. Stroud at No. 2.\n\nDirectly afterwards, the Cardinals pick Georgia DT Jalen Carter and then the Bears are on the clock, again. This time Poles stays put and selects Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson.\n\nIf it works out, it would be an absolute power play for the Bears. Anderson would make an instant impact on the Bears defensive line, which struggled to generate pressure all season. The Bears ranked dead last with only 20 sacks last year, and nearly half of that production came from the second and third levels of the defense. The DL only generated 10.5 sacks total, with Justin Jones and Trevis Gipson tied with three apiece. Rookie safety Jaquan Brisker led the team with four. Anderson wouldn\u2019t be a cure all for the line, but his 27.5 sacks over the past two years will bring a big boost. Of course, it\u2019s far from a sure thing that Poles would be able to pull off two trades like this.\n\n\u201cTaking the Texans' offer could be risky for the Bears if the Colts stay at No. 4 after being beaten out for the top spot\u30fc but doing \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 means (Colts GM Chris) Ballard is incentivized to climb the draft ladder,\u201d wrote Chad Reuter in the NFL.com mock draft, referring to Ballard\u2019s earlier comments that he would move heaven and earth to put himself in position to draft the Colts QB of the future. \u201cOpening Door No. 1 and Door No. 2 in the trade game allows Chicago GM Ryan Poles to hedge his bets in the hopes that at least one of the two partners send over very early picks after a disappointing 2023 campaign.\u201d\n\nBut Poles isn\u2019t done just yet. Reuter mocks the Bears trading back into the first round to select SMU WR Rashee Rice.\n\n\u201cAfter accumulating multiple selections in the two earlier trades, the Bears are fine sending the Colts' second-round pick (No. 35) and their own fourth-rounder to the Chiefs to move up for their choice of receiver,\u201d wrote Reuter. \u201cRice was the main cog in the Mustangs' offense in 2022, a target on quick screens, hitches and nine routes, where he used his strider's speed, ability to win 50-50 balls and tracking skills to score.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Plenty of trades, two impact players, one on offense, one on defense. Seems like a pretty good day for the Bears. We\u2019ll see if they can take a dream like this and turn it into a reality.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "Bears quarterback Justin Fields emerged as one of the NFL\u2019s most exciting young players last season, where he made defenses pay with his impressive athleticism.\n\nFields was the one of the lone bright spots in Chicago\u2019s disappointing 3-14 season, and he managed to find success despite being surrounded by arguably the worst roster in the league. But things are looking up as the Bears are slated to have roughly $99 million in salary cap space and the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the downsides \u2014 perhaps the only one \u2014 of having the top pick is having to deal with the Fields trade chatter. Even though Chicago has shown no indication that they\u2019re considering moving on from Fields.\n\nOne NFL coach summed it up best when he discussed Fields\u2019 upside with ESPN NFL insider Jeremy Fowler:\n\n\u201c[The Bears] had no business being in some of the games they were in this year \u2014 that was because of Fields.\u201d The great quarterbacks can overcome roster deficiencies. Fields seems to have that element, even if he needs more polish as a pocket passer.\n\nFields carried the offense on his back \u2014 technically, legs \u2014 where he rushed for 1,143 yards, falling just 64 yards shy of Lamar Jackson\u2019s single-season rushing record. Fields did make NFL history with 178 yards against the Dolphins, the most ever by a quarterback in a regular season game.\n\nWhile Fields certainly needs to improve as a passer, he\u2019s shown enough in his first two seasons to warrant a true evaluation.\n\nYes, Bears general manager Ryan Poles will do his homework on quarterbacks Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Will Levis in the pre-draft process. But that doesn\u2019t mean Chicago is moving on from Fields.",

Here\u2019s why\u2026 In two years he\u2019s been BAD and BAD. \u2018WELL, THE OFFENSIVE LINE!\u2019\u2026 No, it\u2019s actually rated 14th in the NFL. Burrow\u2019s was rated significantly worse this year. In two years Fields completed 59%, has a passer rating under 80, 24 TDs and 21 picks, it\u2019s BAD. Justin Herbert\u2019s first year in the league his offensive line was rated dead last in the league, his coach was uncreative and got fired, and he put up huge numbers. Herbert\u2019s offensive line was significantly worse as a rookie than the Bears\u2019 this year. Andrew Luck\u2019s first two years\u2014 11-5, 11-5. His o-line was much worse. Joe Burrow\u2019s this year was ranked 28th, last year it was atrocious and he got to a Super Bowl. You can\u2019t use the o-line excuse anymore. It ain\u2019t great but it\u2019s not Herbert-rookie year bad, it\u2019s not Cincinnati last-year-three-years bad, and it\u2019s not close to Andrew Luck, and those guys won, A LOT. \u2018WELL, THE WEAPONS!\u2019\u2026 Bears have good backs, and an excellent young tight end, they could use another receiver. But again, his protection is better than anyone wants to acknowledge. With Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts I saw tremendous and staggering growth in year 1 to year 2, I didn\u2019t with Fields. He\u2019s more YouTube star. Sensational plays but the little stuff\u2014 footwork, accuracy\u2014 I think you have to consider it. Here are four reasons\u2026 One more season of average to bad, and you\u2019ll get nothing for him. Second, the Bears have a defensive coach and a defensive culture. They [the front office] didn\u2019t draft him, he\u2019s not their guy. Third, Chicago probably won\u2019t have the number one pick for awhile. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be good, but you\u2019re not going to be in this territory again, use the opportunity. Four, you had Khalil Mack and Roquan Smith and you couldn\u2019t win games. You think Will Anderson Jr. is going to come in and change the franchise around? They lost ten straight games this year in a down-year for the Packers, and a year the Lions and Vikings defenses were atrocious. You have to consider calling Atlanta and going \u2018we will give you Justin Fields, give us your no. 8 pick\u2019. Go get Bryce Young and then get the second or third-best edge rusher. I like Justin Fields but I never thought he was Trevor Lawrence, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s close to Caleb Williams or Drake Maye. He\u2019s not an Andrew Luck and he\u2019s not a guy who can succeed when the circumstances aren\u2019t great. He\u2019s more Trey Lance, he will work if he gets the right stuff, and I don't think Chicago has the right stuff. If Carr goes to Carolina, and Jimmy goes to Tampa, you think Arthur Blank, the owner of the Falcons, wants to sit there and be awful again?
