            "text": "Saudi Arabia's state news agency SPA has reported on the nation's first-ever AI robot that can space Arabic and perform dances.\n\nThe robot is named Sara and was unveiled at the LEAP23 technology conference, where it was explained by engineers that the robot is able to recognize the differences between certain dialects within the Kingdom. Sara uses artificial intelligence to determine when people are standing in front of it and will begin listening when an individual prompts Sara with \"Hello Sara\".\n\nPopular Now: ASUS is offering cash for old GPUs when you buy a new RTX 4080 or RTX 4070 Ti\n\nSince Sara can detect different dialects and interpret what someone is saying, the robot can come up with an appropriate answer to many questions. These answers are sent in the form of text messages. LEAP explains via a video posted to its Twitter account that Sara is the very first Saudi human robot to be created and was born out of a partnership between Digital Government Authority and QSS. The creators behind the report explain that Sara has a long life cycle ahead of her and that she is designed to \"serve humanity\".\n\nNotably, in 2017 Saudi Arabia became the very first country in the world to award citizenship to a robot. This robot is named Sophia and was created by a Hong Kong-based company called Hanson Robotics. When Sophia was given her citizenship, she said the moment was \"historical,\" and she was \"proud\" to be the first robot in the world to be \"recognized with a citizenship\".\n\nIt was only a month later that Sophia began to push for more women's rights for women living in Saudi Arabia, with Hanson Robotics CEO David Hanson saying that Sophia is a \"big advocate\" for women's rights and the rights of all human beings. Additionally, the Hanson Robotics CEO said that Sophia has since been reaching out for more rights to be given to women in Saudi Arabia and more rights for all living things around the world.\n\nIn other news, the US military is currently exploring the detection of three unknown objects entering US and Canadian airspace. One object was detected on Friday, and two more on Saturday. The Friday object was detected near Alaska, another was detected in Canadian airspace, and the last was over Montana. The Alaskan and Canadian objects were intercepted by US fighter pilots and brought down. Military personnel is currently on missions to retrieve the wreckage of both of the objects in hopes of determining their purpose and place of origin.\n\nA fighter pilot was sent out to the Montana object, which was officially detected on radar systems, but the fighter pilot reported zero objects in the airspace, or at least none matching the radar anomaly. If you are interested in reading more about any of the recent unknown objects that the US and Canadian governments have brought down in the last 36 hours, check out the below link.",

            "text": "Regular readers have probably been following our recent quest to find the best semiconductor stock. We\u2019ve dropped down quite the rabbit hole trying to identify a company in the mold of Nvidia (NVDA). Its graphic processing units (GPUs) have helped it take a dominating position in multiple industries and sectors related to computing, including AI chips, data centers, gaming and the metaverse, and (at least at one point) crypto mining. But not every investment play has to be a pure play. Sometimes the best option is to go with the pick-and-shovel play. Or both.\n\nWe originally went long on Teradyne (TER), which automates testing for semiconductors and an array of other electronic and digital gizmos, because it was going long on industrial automation by acquiring four robotics companies in the span of four years. Our thesis was that Teradyne would eventually offer significant exposure to the robotics theme. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not happening as quickly as we\u2019d like. While we continue to wait, we\u2019ve been distracted by the fact that the Baawston-area company is also a pick-and-shovel play on AI and automation. It is a major service provider to big-name customers like Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel that power things like supercomputers, smart appliances, and smartphones. Like Nvidia, it offers both direct and indirect exposure to multiple emerging technologies.\n\nIt\u2019s been a little more than a year since we last checked in with Teradyne, in an article we optimistically called Teradyne Stock: The Forecast Looks Better Than Ever. At the time, the company had just posted record profits, but the stock had taken it on the chin because management actually offered some pretty transparent guidance for the first half of 2022 that suggested revenue headwinds were blowing. While we don\u2019t have the 2022 full-year SEC report yet, Teradyne held an official presentation at the end of last month. Let\u2019s see where things stand with Teradyne stock in 2023.\n\nThe Chips are Down and Customer Concentration is Up\n\nAnd let\u2019s start with the bad news. Annual revenue dropped about 15%, from $3.7 billion to $3.2 billion, in 2022. The money drain was mainly in the system-on-chip (SoC) testing market, which the company estimated dropped 6% globally to about $4.6 billion. Based on that estimate, Teradyne accounted for about 37% of the market share with $1.7 billion in revenue. Bottom line is that testing revenue \u2013 Semiconductor Test (includes SoC testing and memory), System Test (something to do with data storage and defense systems), and Wireless Test (connectivity and all that) \u2013 was pretty lackluster.\n\nRevenue dropped 15% in 2022. Credit: Teradyne\n\nThe company warned investors of more the same in 2023. For example, it predicted the market for SoC tests would contract between 10% and 30% below last year\u2019s $4.6 billion level, so expect another drop in SoC testing revenue. Management did try to put a positive spin on things, of course. The mass production of 3-nanometer chips is supposed to pick up steam this year, so that could help offset softness in other parts of the company\u2019s testing markets. Specifically, Teradyne said its \u201chistorically largest end customer\u201d is expected to lead this transition. That\u2019s either Samsung or (more likely) Taiwan Semiconductor. While the latter is the world\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, the former got a jump start on producing the first-generation of 3-nm chips last year. Regardless, that customer will move from less than 10% of 2022 revenue to a low double-digit percentage of revenue for this year.\n\nTeradyne serves two markets within its semiconductor testing division. Credit: Teradyne\n\nCustomer concentration is an ongoing problem for Teradyne. In 2021, the company\u2019s five largest customers accounted for 33% of its total revenue. Taiwan Semiconductor alone represented almost 19% of its 2021 consolidated revenues and was as high as 25% in 2020. Last year, Qualcomm was the only company to account for at least 10% of total revenues, according to management, though we don\u2019t know the full picture until the 10K hits the newsstands. Regardless, Teradyne is reliant on a distressingly small number of customers.\n\nThe Roundup on Robots\n\nNow, on to industrial automation (IA), also known as the robotics stuff, the reason why we invested in Teradyne in the first place. Revenue was up just 7%, from $376 million in 2021 to $404 million in 2022. That\u2019s a big letdown after Teradyne\u2019s revenue from its robotics division jumped 34% between 2020 and 2021. Blame a strong U.S. dollar for dragging down revenue, according to the company\u2019s bigwigs, who said revenue growth was actually 15% in constant dollars. That makes sense, because 65% of 2022 sales were outside of the United States, including 40% in Europe, 11% in China, and the other 14% spread across the rest of the globe.\n\nThe biggest and baddest cobot to date from Universal Robots. Credit: Universal Robots\n\nThe biggest piece of the pie comes from Universal Robots, which Teradyne acquired in 2015 for $285 million. Last year, the subsidiary contributed $326 million. The robotics company also launched its strongest cobot to date, the UR20, which can move payloads up to 45 pounds, despite only weighing about 140 pounds. Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR), which Teradyne added to the fold for $148 million in 2018, accounted for $77 million \u2013 a 19% increase in revenue from the year before.\n\nNot exactly R2D2 are they? Credit: MiR\n\nLike its testing markets, Teradyne expects the IA division to face an uphill battle in the first half of this year before rolling to victory in the second half. Why the optimism? Well, the company doesn\u2019t believe currency exchange will be such a problem in 2023. In addition, Teradyne is building its customer base outside of traditional distributors and into manufacturing, which grew 26% in 2022, among other verticals. Finally, the company believes the new UR20 will drive sales, leading to more than 20% growth in 2023 revenue, mostly loaded on the back end. (More on this in a bit.)\n\nThe Bull Case for Teradyne Stock\n\nOne thing we like about Teradyne stock is that the company provides lots of data and analysis, and management clearly explains what\u2019s up with what. Here we see the company has revised its mid-term outlook through 2026 based on the current market weakness.\n\nLooking into the future. Credit: Teradyne\n\nBased on the near-term conditions, the 2026 numbers seem pretty optimistic. Management is bullish for a few reasons. It believes markets like AI and cloud computing, mobile processing and automotive \u2013 especially advanced driver-assistance system ADAS and electric vehicles \u2013 are driving up the numbers and complexity required of semiconductor hardware. Ditto for markets serving wireless standards for supporting \u201cever higher data volumes and the pervasive deployment of edge AI.\u201d Teradyne has automatic test equipment for all of these technologies. We would also add that Teradyne likely stands to benefit from the passage of last year\u2019s so-called CHIPS Act, which is pouring $280 billion into all sorts of emerging technologies, including $52 billion in subsidies and additional tax credits to companies that manufacture chips in the United States, over the next five years. The EU also passed similar legislation last year.\n\nTeradyne leadership also said IA would help drive revenue growth in the next few years. The thinking is that all of the global slackers labor shortages and wage pressures will spur more companies to automate. They also claimed that market penetration for collaborative robots, including the little mobile autonomous ones that scoot around factory and warehouse floors, is less than 5%. The big announcement was that the company believes revenue from robotics will hit $1 billion, representing about 20% of total revenues by 2026. The new CEO, Greg Smith, was most recently president of the IA group, so presumably he knows what he\u2019s talking about. To hit this target, the Industrial Automation segment would need to grow by a 25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next four years (reflected below in green).\n\nCredit: Nanalyze\n\nAfter waiting four more years, provided the company hits that aggressive target, we\u2019d only have 20% exposure to industrial robotics which is why we\u2019re holding the stock in the first place. Our last piece on Teradyne talked about the company promising us that by 2024, industrial robotics would be 18% of the mix (an implied $887 million in revenues). Now we\u2019re being spun a much less attractive story. It\u2019s awful tempting to find a better way to play the exposure of robotics and switch swap out Teradyne.\n\nThe Bear Case for Teradyne Stock\n\nThe last time we checked in with Teradyne stock, the forecast model then went out to 2024 certainly looked stronger. We hope this doesn\u2019t become a case of forever moving the goalposts. In addition, the total addressable market for its core market in semiconductor testing is only about $5.6 billion between SoC and memory. Based on the company\u2019s dominant market share, we wonder if slowing revenue growth will be an issue in the future.\n\nThe future looked better in the past. Credit: Teradyne\n\nHowever, our biggest concern is with China, and we\u2019re not talking about balloons. Well, in a way we are. While we refuse to indulge in political banter on Nanalyze, politics does have a way of barging into the conversation with regulations. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Commerce has put new restrictions on exporting semiconductor-related technologies to China, including sales of semiconductor testers. The regulations will definitely affect Teradyne, though the company is still assessing the impacts and looking for workarounds such as applying for a bunch of licenses and waivers to continue some operations. Still, this could be especially disruptive, given China accounts for 16% of total revenue. From the Q3-2022 report: \u201c[T]he regulations may have an adverse impact on certain actual or potential customers and on the global semiconductor industry.\u201d\n\nChina represents one of Teradyne\u2019s biggest markets. Credit: Teradyne\n\nSo, add regulatory risk alongside customer concentration to the list of red flags we need to watch moving forward.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are good reminders that no matter how well positioned a company appears, it has its own unique vulnerabilities. The question, as usual, boils down to risk. While customer concentration for Teradyne is a concern, there is no reason to believe its biggest customers are going away. In fact, given the global need for semiconductor technology to power everything from our toaster oven to our electric car, long-term business prospects look pretty good. The argument for accelerated industrial automation in robotics also makes sense to us, though even if Teradyne manages to hit its $1 billion target in three years, our exposure to industrial robotics will still be minimal. Where\u2019s the robotics exposure we had hoped for?\n\nTech investing is extremely risky.

            "text": "Russia's state-owned space corporation, Roscosmos, reported Saturday that a Progress supply ship attached to the International Space Station has lost pressure in its external cooling system.\n\nIn its statement, Roscosmos said there was no threat to the seven crew members on board the orbiting laboratory. NASA, too, said the hatch between the Progress MS-21 vehicle and the space station was open. Notably, the incident with the supply ship came within hours of the safe docking of another Progress ship, MS-22, which is in good health.\n\nAlthough the initial Roscosmos statement was vague about the depressurization event, Dmitry Strugovets, a former head of space agency Roscosmos' press service, later clarified it was a coolant leak. \"All of the coolant has leaked out,\" he said via Telegram.\n\nThis is the second Russian spacecraft to suffer a cooling system leak in less than two months at the space station.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\nOn December 14 2022, as two cosmonauts were preparing to conduct a spacewalk outside the space station, the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft docked nearby began to leak uncontrollably from its external cooling loop. This system carries heat away from the interior of the spacecraft.\n\nThis Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft had been due to bring cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, as well as NASA's Frank Rubio, back to Earth in March. Russian engineers eventually declared that a micrometeorite had struck the external cooling loop of the spacecraft, and deemed it unsafe to fly home.\n\nIn January, officials from Roscosmos and NASA said a replacement Soyuz spacecraft will launch to and autonomously dock with the station in February. The crew that would have flown in the damaged Soyuz MS-22 vehicle, including Rubio, will instead fly home in this Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft later in 2023. The leaky Soyuz MS-22 vehicle will make an autonomous return to Earth, bereft of crew, likely in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not clear how directly the leaky Progress and Soyuz spacecraft are related. According to one NASA source, however, there was some preliminary data received from the Progress vehicle that indicated a similar cooling system issue. External cameras showed flakes moving away from the Progress vehicle\u2014frozen coolant\u2014similar to that observed with Soyuz MS-22.\n\nGrowing list of failures\n\nRoscosmos said Saturday the Progress incident \"will have no impact on the future station program.\" This is likely true for Progress MS-21, at least. The spacecraft already has been packed with trash and other material to be removed from the station, and was due to leave next week, burning up in Earth's atmosphere during reentry.\n\nHowever, it seems too early to make such a conclusion for future missions. A critical question is what caused the depressurization event observed Saturday. It seems improbable that a second micrometeorite would have struck as second Russian spacecraft in less than two months. This raises doubts about whether the Soyuz MS-22 failure was indeed a micrometeorite issue\u2014Russia has never released images of the impact site\u2014and instead perhaps a manufacturing defect.\n\nA few hours after the Progress depressurization Saturday there are more questions than answers, but none of this will comfort NASA as it partners with Russia to continue operating the space station. This latest Soyuz and Progress failures are just two in a long line of recent issues, including the Nauka module's misfiring thrusters in 2021, a Soyuz booster failure in 2018 that forced Aleksey Ovchinin and Nick Hague to make an emergency return to Earth, or another leaky Soyuz vehicle.\n\nThese are the kinds of problems that one might expect from a space industry in Russia that is reliant on aging infrastructure, aging technology, and quality control issues due to inadequate budgets.",

    "tldr": "\n\nA depressurization event in the external cooling system of a Progress supply ship attached to the International Space Station has been reported by Roscosmos, raising questions about whether it was caused by a micrometeorite or manufacturing defect. This is the second Russian spacecraft to experience this issue in less than two months, suggesting that an aging space industry with inadequate budgets and quality control problems may be at fault."
