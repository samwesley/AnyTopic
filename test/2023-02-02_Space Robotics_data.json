            "text": "After the ONE and the OCF, now comes the ODM. AGILOX North America, a leading manufacturer of automated material handling solutions, is adding an autonomous dolly mover to its range of intelligent transport systems controlled by its proprietary X-Swarm intelligence. AGILOX is thus targeting an entirely new area of applications: the transport of small load carriers.\n\n\n\nMore Headlines Articles\n\nAGILOX is expanding its Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) range with the new Omnidirectional Dolly Mover AGILOX ODM. It can accept loads with a maximum weight of 300 kg / 661 lbs. to a maximum lifting height of 250 mm / 10 inches and transport them to their destination. The intelligent AMR concept based on the proven AGILOX X-SWARM technology thus opens up new areas of applications and other industry segments where small load carriers (such as totes), which the new AGILOX ODM is designed to transport, are widely used, especially in the electronics and pharmaceutical industries.Details of the new AGILOX ODMThe AGILOX ODM is a true autonomous mobile robot: The compact vehicle travels autonomously and navigates freely on the production floor or in the warehouse, perfectly ensuring the in-house material flow. Like the AGILOX ONE and the AGILOX OCF, the AGILOX ODM uses an omnidirectional drive concept. This allows it to travel transversely into rack aisles and turn on the spot, enabling it to maneuver even in the tightest spaces. The lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) accumulator ensures short charge times and long operating cycles.\"AGILOX is a company that has built a strong foundation with the AGILOX ONE and the AGILOX OCF. With the new AGILOX ODM, we remain true to our brand DNA while simultaneously targeting the transport of small load carriers to support our growth plan to become the world's leading AMR provider,\" says Andreas Boedenauer, CEO of AGILOX North America.The AGILOX advantageWith the new AGILOX ODM, customers benefit from the advantages of the proven X-SWARM technology that already powers the AGILOX ONE and the AGILOX OCF: the unique advantages of an (intra-)logistics solution designed from the ground up.Since AGILOX AMRs have no central fleet management system and can navigate in the existing warehouse and production facility environment with millimeter precision, there is no need for time-consuming and costly modifications to the existing infrastructure. Autonomous route-finding also enables the vehicles to avoid obstacles unaided. If it is impossible to get past a detected obstacle due to its size or the available clearance, the AMRs calculate a new route within seconds to reach their destination as quickly as possible. This gives customers maximum freedom in their existing processes, as the system adapts to the customer's processes and not the other way around. Furthermore, fully autonomous routing ensures a safe workflow - even in mixed operations.Plug & Perform commissioning means that, once the AMRs have been put into operation, they organize themselves according to the decentralized architecture of swarm intelligence, i.e., they exchange information several times a second to enable the entire fleet to find the most efficient routes and prevent potential deadlocks before they even occur. The customer thus benefits from a system that constantly runs smoothly, with no downtime. Time-consuming coordination of vehicles by customers is also a thing of the past, thanks to AGILOX X-SWARM technology. This dramatically improves flexibility, letting the user expand the vehicle's area of operation within just a few minutes. It also means that it is very easy to move an AGILOX AMR to be used temporarily in other areas of the facility or even in subsidiaries. Since AGILOX vehicles can also communicate with other technologies installed in the building infrastructure using IO boxes, even rolling doors or multiple floors are no problem for the AMRs. Customers enjoy maximum flexibility in the organization of their production processes.Another significant advantage comes from the combined operation of the various AGILOX AMRs in a swarm. For example, the smaller AGILOX ONE and ODM series vehicles feed the assembly workstations or e-Kanban racks, while the AGILOX OCF vehicles transport the pallets. All vehicles use the same control and WiFi infrastructure.Customers will get a chance to see the AGILOX ONE together with its bigger siblings ONE and OCF in March 2023 at the PROMAT show in Chicago (Booth# N7316).https://www.agilox.net/en/product/agilox-odm/",

            "text": "Imagine that your neighbor calls to ask a favor: Could you please feed their pet rabbit some carrot slices? Easy enough, you\u2019d think. You can imagine their kitchen, even if you\u2019ve never been there \u2014 carrots in a fridge, a drawer holding various knives. It\u2019s abstract knowledge: You don\u2019t know what your neighbor\u2019s carrots and knives look like exactly, but you won\u2019t take a spoon to a cucumber.\n\nArtificial intelligence programs can\u2019t compete. What seems to you like an easy task is a huge undertaking for current algorithms.\n\nAn AI-trained robot can find a specified knife and carrot hiding in a familiar kitchen, but in a different kitchen it will lack the abstract skills to succeed. \u201cThey don\u2019t generalize to new environments,\u201d said Victor Zhong, a graduate student in computer science at the University of Washington. The machine fails because there\u2019s simply too much to learn, and too vast a space to explore.\n\nThe problem is that these robots \u2014 and AI agents in general \u2014 don\u2019t have a foundation of concepts to build on. They don\u2019t know what a knife or a carrot really is, much less how to open a drawer, choose one and cut slices. This limitation is due in part to the fact that many advanced AI systems get trained with a method called reinforcement learning that\u2019s essentially self-education through trial and error. AI agents trained with reinforcement learning can execute the job they were trained to do very well, in the environment they were trained to do it in. But change the job or the environment, and these systems will often fail.\n\nTo get around this limitation, computer scientists have begun to teach machines important concepts before setting them loose. It\u2019s like reading a manual before using new software: You could try to explore without it, but you\u2019ll learn far faster with it. \u201cHumans learn through a combination of both doing and reading,\u201d said Karthik Narasimhan, a computer scientist at Princeton University. \u201cWe want machines to do the same.\u201d\n\nNew work from Zhong and others shows that priming a learning model in this way can supercharge learning in simulated environments, both online and in the real world with robots. And it doesn\u2019t just make algorithms learn faster \u2014 it guides them toward skills they\u2019d otherwise never learn. Researchers want these agents to become generalists, capable of learning anything from chess to shopping to cleaning. And as demonstrations become more practical, scientists think this approach might even change how humans can interact with robots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty big breakthrough,\u201d said Brian Ichter, a research scientist in robotics at Google. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unimaginable how far it\u2019s come in a year and a half.\u201d\n\nSparse Rewards\n\nAt first glance, machine learning has already been remarkably successful. Most models typically use reinforcement learning, where algorithms learn by getting rewards. They begin totally ignorant, but trial and error eventually becomes trial and triumph. Reinforcement learning agents can easily master simple games.\n\nConsider the video game Snake, where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats digital apples. You want your snake to eat the most apples, stay within the boundaries and avoid running into its increasingly bulky body. Such clear right and wrong outcomes give a well-rewarded machine agent positive feedback, so enough attempts can take it from \u201cnoob\u201d to High Score.\n\nBut suppose the rules change. Perhaps the same agent must play on a larger grid and in three dimensions. While a human player could adapt quickly, the machine can\u2019t, because of two critical weaknesses. First, the larger space means it takes longer for the snake to stumble upon apples, and learning slows exponentially when rewards become sparse. Second, the new dimension provides a totally new experience, and reinforcement learning struggles to generalize to new challenges.\n\nZhong says we don\u2019t need to accept these obstacles. \u201cWhy is it that when we want to play chess\u201d \u2014 another game that reinforcement learning has mastered \u2014 \u201cwe train a reinforcement learning agent from scratch?\u201d Such approaches are inefficient. The agent wanders around aimlessly until it stumbles upon a good situation, such as a checkmate, and Zhong says it requires careful human design to get the agent to know what it means for a situation to be good. \u201cWhy do we have to do this when we already have so many books on how to play chess?\u201d\n\nPartly, it\u2019s because machines have struggled to understand human language and decipher images in the first place. For a robot to complete vision-based tasks like finding and slicing carrots, for example, it must know what a carrot is \u2014 the image of a thing must be \u201cgrounded\u201d in a more fundamental understanding of what that thing is. Until recently, there was no good way of doing that, but a boom in the speed and scale of language and image processing has made the new successes possible.\n\nNew natural language processing models allow machines to essentially learn the meaning behind words and sentences \u2014 to ground them in things in the world \u2014 rather than just store a simple (and limited) meaning like a digital dictionary.\n\nComputer vision has seen a similar digital explosion. Around 2009, ImageNet debuted as a database of annotated images for computer vision research. Today it hosts over 14 million images of objects and places. And programs like OpenAI\u2019s DALL\u00b7E generate new images upon command that look human-made, despite having no exact comparison to draw from.\n\nIt shows how machines only now have access to enough online data to really learn about the world, according to Anima Anandkumar, a computer scientist at the California Institute of Technology and Nvidia. And it\u2019s a sign that they can learn from concepts as we do and use them for generation. \u201cWe are in such a great moment now,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause once we can get generation, there is so much more we can do.\u201d\n\nGaming the System\n\nResearchers like Zhong decided machines didn\u2019t have to embark on their explorations wholly uninformed anymore. Armed with sophisticated language models, the researchers could add a pre-training step where a program learned from online information before its trials and errors.\n\nTo test the idea, he and his colleagues compared the pre-training to traditional reinforcement learning in five different game-like settings where machine agents interpreted language commands to solve problems. Each simulated environment challenged the machine agent uniquely. One asked the agent to manipulate items in a 3D kitchen; another required reading text to learn a precise sequence of actions to fight monsters. But the most complicated setting was a real game, the 35-year-old NetHack, where the goal is to navigate a sophisticated dungeon to retrieve an amulet.\n\nFor the simple settings, automated pre-training meant simply grounding the important concepts: This is a carrot, that is a monster. For NetHack, the agent trained by watching humans play, using playthroughs uploaded to the internet by human players. These playthroughs didn\u2019t even have to be that good \u2014 the agent only needed to build intuition for how humans behave. The agent wasn\u2019t meant to become an expert, just a regular player. It would build intuition by watching \u2014 what would a human do in a given scenario? The agent would decide what moves were successful, formulating its own carrot and stick.\n\n\u201cThrough pre-training, we form good priors for how to associate language descriptions with things that are happening in the world,\u201d Zhong said. The agent would play better from the start and learn more quickly during subsequent reinforcement learning.\n\nAs a result, the pre-trained agent did outperform the traditionally trained one. \u201cWe get gains across the board in all five of these environments,\u201d Zhong said. Simpler settings only showed a slight edge, but in NetHack\u2019s complicated dungeons, the agent learned many times faster and reached a skill level that the classic approach couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou might be getting a 10x performance because if you don\u2019t do this, then you just don\u2019t learn a good policy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese generalist agents are a big leap from what standard reinforcement learning does,\u201d Anandkumar said.\n\nHer team also pre-trains agents to get them to learn more quickly, achieving significant progress on the world\u2019s bestselling video game, Minecraft. It\u2019s known as a \u201csandbox\u201d game, meaning it gives players a virtually infinite space in which to interact and create new worlds. It\u2019s futile to program a reward function for thousands of tasks individually, so instead the team\u2019s model (\u201cMineDojo\u201d) built its understanding of the game by watching captioned playthrough videos. No need to codify good behavior.\n\n\u201cWe are getting automated reward functions,\u201d Anandkumar said. \u201cThis is the first benchmark with thousands of tasks and the ability to do reinforcement learning with open-ended tasks specified through text prompts.\u201d\n\nBeyond Games\n\nGames were a great way to show that pre-training models could work, but they\u2019re still simplified worlds. Training robots to handle the real world, where the possibilities are practically endless, is much harder. \u201cWe asked the question: Is there something in between?\u201d Narasimhan said. So he decided to do some online shopping.\n\nHis team created WebShop. \u201cIt\u2019s basically like a shopping butler,\u201d Narasimhan said. Users can say something like \u201cGive me a Nike shoe that\u2019s white and under $100, and I want the reviews to state that they\u2019re very comfortable for toddlers,\u201d and the program finds and buys the shoe.\n\nAs with Zhong\u2019s and Anandkumar\u2019s games, WebShop developed an intuition by training with images and text, this time from Amazon pages. \u201cOver time, it learns to understand the language and map it to actions it has to take on the website.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, a shopping butler may not seem that futuristic. But while a cutting-edge chatbot can link you to a desired sneaker, interactions like placing the order require a wholly different skill set. And even though your bedside Alexa or Google Home speakers can place orders, they rely on proprietary software that carries out preordained tasks. WebShop navigates the web the way people do: by reading, typing and clicking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step closer toward general intelligence,\u201d Narasimhan said.",

            "text": "Former US Air Force major Even \u201cJolly\u201d Rogers is worried about a space war. \u201cConflict exists on a continuum that begins with competition and ultimately leads into full-scale conflict like what you\u2019re seeing in Ukraine,\u201d he says. The US, he adds, is already \u201cin active competition with Russia and China for freedom of action and dominance of the space domain. And it\u2019s evolving very quickly.\u201d\n\nSo on January 26 last year, the former US Air Force major incorporated True Anomaly, Inc to \u201csolve the most challenging orbital warfare problems for the US Space Force,\u201d he later tweeted.\n\nAccording to a recent filing with the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC), True Anomaly is now gearing up for its first orbital mission. In October, True Anomaly hopes to launch two Jackal \u201corbital pursuit\u201d spacecraft aboard a SpaceX rocket to low earth orbit. The Jackals will not house guns, warheads, or laser blasters, but they will be capable of rendezvous proximity operations (RPO)\u2014the ability to maneuver close to other satellites and train a battery of sensors upon them. This could reveal their rivals\u2019 surveillance and weapons systems, or help intercept communications.\n\nIn their first mission, dubbed Demo-1, the Jackals will merely spy on each other, using thrusters, radar, and multi-spectral cameras to approach within a few hundred meters. If that goes well, Rogers envisages deploying thousands of autonomous spacecraft in service of the US military, controlled by a team of human operators and AI \u201cto pursue adversaries wherever they fly, and to provide the tools of accountability.\u201d\n\nThose tools start with understanding what technologies America\u2019s adversaries are deploying in space. \u201cBut an active defense is going to be required,\u201d says Rogers, now True Anomaly\u2019s CEO. \u201cIf you take the job of defense and protection of the domain seriously, you have to have the ability to do the joint functions of maneuver and fires.\u201d Although the military often uses \u201cfires\u201d to mean kinetic weapons like guns and shells, in the space context, it usually refers to jamming, electronic warfare, and cyberattacks.\n\nNothing on True Anomaly\u2019s website suggests that it is developing its own offensive weapons. However, in a series of posts last summer, Rogers tweeted: \u201cTactically disabling enemy spacecraft can be the difference between the loss of an entire Carrier Strike Group or its survival \u2026 And there are many ways to destroy spacecraft that don\u2019t ruin the environment. After all, they are just floating computers.\u201d\n\nRPO itself is nothing new. In a report last September, the Secure World Foundation, a private foundation promoting cooperative solutions in space, detailed dozens of military RPO operations in geostationary and low earth orbits since the Cold War. Most of these involve American, Russian, or Chinese spacecraft sidling up to each other\u2019s satellites, presumably to see what they look like or to eavesdrop on their communications.\n\nThere are also emerging peaceful uses of RPO, such as space tugs that can repair or relocate failed satellites, or remove dangerous space junk. The Secure World Foundation helps run an organization called Confers that is setting voluntary technical standards for commercial RPO. True Anomaly is one of around 60 Confers members. \u201cIf we ever want to do things like cleaning up space debris, we have to develop these technologies,\u201d says Brian Weeden, the foundation\u2019s director of planning. However, True Anomaly is the first RPO startup explicitly focusing on the military market, he says.",

The machine is made by \u201cBuild With Robots,\u201d a firm located in downtown Albuquerque.\n\n\u201cThe issue that we found is, most facilities, do you want to disinfect regularly. They just don\u2019t have the workforce to do it,\u201d said Chris Ziomek, the founder and CEO of Build with Robots.\n\nIn fact, they sent KOB 4 a prototype to use in the newsroom. Its small size makes it easy to move and can cover an area of up to 30,000 cubic feet. That includes EMS vehicles, school buses and classrooms. All that\u2019s needed is to press a button and then it takes just 30 seconds to disinfect a whole room.\n\nZiomek says it\u2019s 99.99% effective in getting rid of a wide range of viruses and pathogens. That includes flu, COVID, norovirus, Rhinoviruses, bacteria, molds and spores.\n\nThree years since New Mexico declared a state of emergency because of COVID, the company says its Breezy line of products has been successful in cutting down on labor and costs.\n\n\u201cAll of us have COVID fatigue at this point where we want to move on. Unfortunately, there\u2019s still disease spread,\u201d Ziomek expressed.\n\nEach machine costs about $2,500, which Ziomek says typically saves the average business enough labor over a month or two before it pays for itself.",

            "text": "You can just about get into orbit on a shoestring budget and now, once there, you can move your satellite with space fuel from the fumes of a few mothballs.\n\nCanberra-based Boswell Technologies and the Australian National University\u2019s Space Plasma Power and Propulsion Group successfully put their naphthalene-powered \u2018Bogong 1 Thruster\u2019 into orbit. It\u2019s part of the payload of a Canberra-based Skykraft satellite launched by Space X on January 3.\n\nIt took six months of design, development and testing to build the innovative engine.\n\nNow the ANU team behind its creation is watching it orbit overhead \u2013 and waiting for the green light to \u201cfire it up\u201d.\n\nSkykraft is undertaking the slow but steady process of establishing contact with each of its four satellites. The Bogong is a subsystem of one of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in orbit, but we\u2019re still suffering from butterflies as we wait to communicate with it,\u201d says Technical Manager of the Bogong Thruster Project Dr Mahdi Davoodianidalik. \u201cBut once we do, to be honest, we\u2019re really sure about ourselves. We\u2019ve done a lot of testing, so we\u2019re certain about that part.\u201d\n\nAt normal temperatures, the hydrocarbon naphthalene is a solid \u2013 like mothballs. It\u2019s also very safe which means it doesn\u2019t need much effort to handle or contain when sending it into space.\n\nWhen heated, it transitions directly from a solid into a gas. Exhausting that gas produces thrust.\n\nDr Dimitrios Tsifakis developed the concept as part of his PhD at the ANU Research School of Physics. Its low-tech simplicity proved immediately appealing to Australia\u2019s rapidly expanding space industry.\n\n\u201cEveryone is trying to develop propulsion systems based on different concepts,\u201d says Professor Christine Charles. \u201cBut this is the simplest concept.\u201d It was developed in the laboratory at ANU, with industry partner Boswell Technologies.\n\nTraditional chemical thrusters rely on bulky, volatile fuels and an oxidiser. These produce powerful thrust, but burn through fuel quickly. On the other hand, electric thrusters such as ion engines, are more fuel efficient and commercially available, but are more complex and consequently expensive. There is a need for a wider range of options for micro-and nano-satellite propulsion.\n\nEarlier in Cosmos: another space fuel substitute\n\nDavoodianidalik says the Bogong thruster fits somewhere in between.\n\nThe naphthalene sits in a small container separated from the rest of the satellite to avoid any heat conduction. Staying in the dark is enough to keep it solid. But once heat is applied, the naphthalene begins to sublimate \u2013 and a valve releases that as thrust.\n\nGet an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox. Get a daily dose of science Get a weekly Cosmos Catch-up\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the most efficient thruster, at least not yet,\u201d Davoodianidalik says. \u201cWe hope to get it better. But it does give you a range of thrust in a neat, simple package\u201d.\n\nBoswell Technologies CEO, Professor Rod Boswell is supporting the development and commercialisation of the Bogong series of thrusters.\n\nHe was sufficiently impressed by the progress being made in the R&D that he purchased two. One is in orbit now and the second to be launched mid 2023.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s usually the hard part,\u201d Davoodianidalik told Cosmos Science. \u201cI can remember the first few meetings where we all sat down trying to figure out everything we needed to do.\u201d\n\nThe ANU team had a deadline. The SkyKraft satellites were almost ready to ride SpaceX into orbit. So in just six months of late nights, deep discussion and intensive testing they produces a reliable, working thruster.\n\n\u201cNormally, these projects take at least three years,\u201d says Davoodianidalik.\n\nThe design and construction were kept as simple as possible. Only once a proven product was produced were any extra features considered.\n\n\u201cSkyKraft wanted another Bogong engine,\u201d Davoodianidalik says. \u201cSo we added one more feature, tested it thoroughly, and delivered it by December last year. That almost doubled its efficiency. Now Bogong 1.1 is due to go up in a satellite in mid 2023\u201d.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate seeing something I have worked on in use and someone is happy to have it,\u201d Davoodianidalik says. \u201cNow that we have delivered Bogong 1.1, we\u2019re aiming for a Bogon 2 \u2013 a next-generation design\u201d.\n\nBut first comes the flight test of Bogong 1.\n\n\u201cThat will be the really exciting part, for us all to be sitting around a console and sending that command \u2026 \u2018fire up\u2019.\u201d",

However, it is difficult to balance the cost and efficiency of traditional thin-film solar cells.\n\nNanowires are far superior in making high-efficiency, low-cost solar cells due to their advanced properties, such as the epitaxial combination of lattice-mismatched materials without plastic deformation. This could be utilized for the synthesis of axial tandem-junction nanowire solar cells with high efficiency at a low material cost.\n\nNow, researchers at Lund University in Sweden have developed small solar radiation-collecting antennas \u2013 nanowires \u2013 that might work better in space than today\u2019s silicon solar cells.\n\nSince the new nanowires are light and require little material per unit of area, they will soon be tested on satellites, which are powered by solar cells and where efficiency and low weight are the most important factors. In fact, researchers already sent new solar cells into space a few days ago.\n\nLast year, researchers succeeded in building photovoltaic nanowires with three different band gaps. This means that one and the same nanowire consists of three different materials that react to different parts of solar light.\n\nResearch teams around the world are increasingly researching tandem solar cells, which have different band gaps. Some research suggests it could roughly double the efficiency of today\u2019s commercial silicon solar cells.\n\nSilicon-based tandem solar cells are often built by synthesizing different semiconducting materials on top of each other. Lund researchers use a slightly different approach. They have developed a unique method to build extremely thin rods of semiconducting material on a substrate. This allows them to use a small amount of material per unit area, which cuts production costs and makes the method environmentally friendly.\n\nNanowires in three materials imaged by a scanning electron microscope. A thread is a thousand times thinner than a strand of hair. The red and blue color shows the direction of the current and that the nanowires work as a tandem solar cell. Credit: Lund University\n\nThe nanometre-thick rods consist of three materials containing different amounts of indium, arsenic, gallium, and phosphorus. In lab tests using these materials, researchers have so far achieved an efficiency of 16.7%. However, they believe that nanowire solar cells could reach 47% efficiency using the current structure with more band gaps.\n\nBesides their improved light absorption, the nanowire solar cells also possess the durability required for space travel.\n\n\u201cA sheet of nanowires can be likened to a very sparse bed of nails. If some aggressive protons came along, which happens now and then, they would probably land between the wires, and if they happened to eliminate some wires, it would not matter very much. The damage could be worse if they land on a regular thin film,\u201d says Magnus Borgstr\u00f6m, who wrote the articles with the then-doctoral student Lukas Hrachowina.\n\nTo test their materials, the team recently fitted the nanowire solar cells on a research satellite. The satellite was sent into space in the second week of January by the researchers\u2019 collaboration partners at the California Institute of Technology, Caltech, in the USA. The satellite will be in orbit during the spring, and the results are expected to be received on an ongoing basis.\n\nJournal reference:",

The fry-bot will manage fry-feeding, frying, bagging, storing, and arranging the french fries.

I had a chance to visit one, the P-Robo, last September when I was in Tokyo for Smart Kitchen Summit Japan. The robot is a multi-function robot that automates nearly the entire process of creating pasta. It preps the sauces and toppings, heats the noodles (which are pre-cooked and frozen, standard for noodle and pasta restaurants), combines it all in a spinner, and then delivers the meal down along a conveyor belt to the plating station. From there, the meal is plated and a human does the final prep for delivery to the customer. Afterward, the robot washes and cleansthe prep bowls. The entire process takes less than two minutes.\n\nYou can see the P-Robo in action below:\n\nTechMagic Pasta Robot: Noodle cook, saucing, plating all in one minute.\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe Tokyo restaurant where P-Robo slings pasta is owned by the Pronto Corporation, a subsidiary of Japan food and beverage conglomerate Suntory.

            "text": "Matanya Horowitz is the founder and CEO of AMP Robotics, a Colorado-based company in the recycling infrastructure space working to apply AI and robotics for commodities recovery.\n\nThe last year brought no shortage of attention-grabbing headlines about the ways recycling is flawed, or how we\u2019ve been misled into believing it works. To be clear, recycling was never intended to be the sole solution to the proliferation of waste. But what these commentaries fail to capture is the headway that technology-driven efforts are making in shifting industry economics and increasing recycling rates.\n\nInvestment in recycling from venture capital and private equity firms, coalitions, government entities, and consumer packaged goods companies validates the role advanced technology is playing in addressing the industry\u2019s challenges \u2014 and the broad conviction that exists in elevating business models focused on more sustainable materials management.\n\nAs 2023 gets underway, AI will lead trends in waste technology and continue its role in advancing the strategic objectives underlying the U.S. EPA\u2019s road map to achieving a 50% recycling rate by 2030.\n\nAI\u2019s precision expands markets for recycled commodities\n\nTechnology\u2019s undisputed role in unlocking material markets is poised to continue. AI\u2019s precision allows for the separation of many categories of materials that opens doors for the industry.\n\nTake PET thermoforms, a material typically made from No. 1 plastic that is often used in clamshells and berry containers. There are often limits on the amount of PET thermoforms that can be commingled with bales of more valuable PET bottles. On top of that, low prices for virgin resin create a competitive challenge. And while buyers of PET bottles are willing to pay a premium, that\u2019s not always the case with other PET markets like thermoforms.\n\nBut AI technology like ours can separate thermoforms from other PET materials for both mechanical and advanced recycling, enhancing their value. The technology does this with a simple software update to the existing install base of robotic systems. These improvements in technology capabilities are creating end markets and improving circularity for this historically challenging material.\n\nAI, applied in primary or secondary sorting environments, allows recycling operations to create very specific product blends for different end markets, and to update these blends as demand and markets evolve.\n\nAI strengthens and reinvents recycling infrastructure\n\nAI will continue to enable new types of sorting devices for the recycling industry \u2014 driving infrastructure improvements as it supports end market development. Thin film materials like grocery bags and stand-up pouches, for instance, have long been an issue for MRFs around the world. They significantly impact the maintenance of screens and the quality of recovered material \u2014 fiber, in particular. It\u2019s rare I see a MRF that doesn\u2019t have a challenge or headache dealing with film somewhere in the system; more typically, it\u2019s multiple places in the system.\n\nAI is laying the groundwork not only to reduce the contamination burden on MRFs, but to scale the recycling of film and flexible packaging. Many MRFs are looking for a solution for film contamination immediately, even if it\u2019s simply removing the film to residue for the benefit of keeping it out of screens and fiber bales. With the ability to capture film, even if it goes to residue initially, demand will be easier to catalyze.\n\nFlexible packaging has been almost uniformly single-use, but major brands continue to make commitments to use more recycled content in their products, and several states have recently adopted laws aimed at ramping up the use of postconsumer resin in plastic products and packaging. AI is addressing how to recover film economically, which will boost recovery and demand for products manufactured from recycled film and flexibles to develop and support end markets.\n\nAI redefines contamination in the materials stream\n\nAI will continue to reshape what\u2019s considered contamination. AI continuously learns to recognize new types of packaging as brands and manufacturers introduce them into the recycling stream and deploys the learnings to the entire installed base. The vast amount of material being identified, categorized and handled demonstrates that most of the materials found in a curbside stream can be sorted and processed.\n\nThe ability to train AI on new packaging types and formats and transmit that information fleetwide will allow the industry to keep up with the breakneck pace of innovation packaging producers and manufacturers are releasing to store shelves. Technology is flipping the script on materials long considered contaminants, like thin film. If an item can be sorted, then recyclers have a broader array of options for what to do with that item. The notion of \u201chard-to-handle\u201d materials will be relegated to the waste bin.\n\nAI centralizes, proves value in data\n\nAI will help the industry overcome inconsistent access to and use of recycling data. With AI and computer vision, we\u2019re able to identify and describe the objects that pass through MRFs and transform them, both desired commodities and undesired contaminants, into data. Digitizing the waste stream provides transparency about what is and isn\u2019t getting recycled to create better solutions on the path toward a circular economy.\n\nAI technology can record the number of items of a desired commodity type and derive additional data from those objects. This, combined with the mass of produced scrap bales, can offer detailed insights into the trends of a specific material flow \u2014 say PET bottles or PET thermoforms \u2014 in a given MRF, a network of MRFs, or even across a geography. This is powerful data for planning and understanding the supply of desired materials.\n\nAt the facility level, the data AI generates can help recyclers scrutinize their operations, identify inefficiencies and take instantaneous action to rectify them. Material characterization solutions provide actionable, data-driven insights throughout the facility and provide the tools necessary to centralize data collection and reporting.\n\nAI enhances policies to support recycling\n\nAI systems will also revolutionize the way policy makers view the recycling industry. Over the past two years, four states \u2014 Maine, Oregon, Colorado and California \u2014 have passed laws related to extended producer responsibility for packaging, and many other states are considering EPR-related bills.\n\nAs these programs continue to ramp up across the country, the producer responsibility organizations (PRO) as well as the regulators tasked with overseeing these programs will be faced with an immense challenge. That is, how to collect, process, and make sense of the vast array of packaging types and brands for which manufacturers are responsible. Because AI systems already broadly deployed are identifying and categorizing the material coming down the line, it\u2019s only logical to tap this data repository for information the PRO needs to manage EPR programs required by state legislation and regulations.\n\nCertainly, there\u2019s a big difference between what\u2019s recyclable and what gets recycled. We as a society certainly can \u2014 and must \u2014 recycle more. In addition to commodity prices, factors like markets for recovered materials, access to recycling programs, reclamation capacity and more all affect recovery rates.\n\nAgain, recycling was designed to work in concert with other waste management strategies like reducing consumption and reusing material. But claims that recycling \"doesn't work\" or \"can't ever work\" fail to account for the high degree of innovation making recycling processes more efficient and cost-effective in 2023 and the years to come.",

            "text": "Flight. Invisibility. Mind-reading. Super-strength. These powers have mostly been limited to the realms of science fiction and fantasy, though we\u2019re starting to see robots and computers replicate some of them. Now a small robot built by an international team has a new superpower: shape-shifting. Or perhaps a more accurate name would be\u2026 state-shifting.\n\nDescribed in a paper published last week in Matter, the robot can go from a solid state to a liquid state based on manipulation of the magnetic fields around it. The team developed the robot as an attempt to get the best of both worlds in terms of robotic properties and capabilities. Hard robots often can\u2019t access certain spaces because of their inflexible bodies, while flexible robots lack strength and durability. Why not make a bot that can do it all?\n\nVideos show the robot \u201cescaping\u201d from a cage and extracting a ball from a model of a human stomach. The researchers say it could have all kinds of real-world applications, from performing tasks in tight spaces (like soldering a circuit board) to accessing parts of the body that are hard to reach (like the inside of the intestines) to acting as a universal screw by melting and reforming into a screw socket.\n\nThe robot is made primarily of gallium, a soft, silvery metal that\u2019s used in electronic circuits, semiconductors, and LEDs. Its most useful feature in this case is its very low melting point: gallium melts at a cool 85.57 degrees Fahrenheit (29.76 degrees Celsius). That\u2019s just slightly above room temperature (in a warm room, admittedly), or the outdoor temperature on a midsummer day.\n\nThe team sprinkled magnetic particles throughout the gallium, and these are key to the robot\u2019s functionality.\n\n\u201cThe magnetic particles here have two roles,\u201d said the paper\u2019s senior author and mechanical engineer Carmel Majidi of Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cOne is that they make the material responsive to an alternating magnetic field, so you can, through induction, heat up the material and cause the phase change. But the magnetic particles also give the robots mobility and the ability to move in response to the magnetic field.\u201d\n\nGallium\u2019s low melting point meant that exposing it to a rapidly-changing magnetic field generated enough electricity within the metal to cause it to heat up and melt. In the \u201cprison break\u201d experiment the researchers set up, the robot escaped its cell and re-solidified into its original form on the other side. It should be noted that the bot isn\u2019t yet able to re-assume its original form without help, though; there was a mold waiting for it outside the cell.\n\nDespite not having quite reached Terminator status, the ease with which the robot\u2019s state can be manipulated could give it a major advantage over existing phase-shifting materials, which tend to require heat guns or electrical currents to go from solid to liquid. The gallium-based bot is also more fluid in its liquid form than similar materials.\n\nWhen they used it in a model of a human stomach to remove an object, the solid robot was able to move quickly to the object, melt down, surround the object, coalesce back into a solid, and move out of the stomach with the object. The team noted that although the robot worked well in the model, pure gallium would quickly melt inside a real human body; they\u2019d have to add metals like bismuth and tin to raise the material\u2019s melting point for use in biomedical applications.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re showing are just one-off demonstrations, proofs of concept, but much more study will be required to delve into how this could actually be used for drug delivery or for removing foreign objects,\u201d said Majidi.\n\nThe team got some of their inspiration for the robot from sea cucumbers, which can quickly change their stiffness back and forth. They call their invention a \u201cmagnetoactive solid-liquid phase transitional machine.\u201d Using magnetic fields, the robots were also able to jump over moats, climb walls, and support heavy weight.\n\nThe next step is for the team to search for more real-world applications for their technology, and tweak its properties accordingly. Chengfeng Pan, an engineer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who led the study, said, \u201cNow we\u2019re pushing this material system in more practical ways to solve some very specific medical and engineering problems.\u201d\n\nImage Credit: Q.

This round of oversubscribed financing will accelerate the multi-discipline clinical trial for Carina, strengthen R&D and clinical applications development, and further bolster the company\u2019s deeply experienced talent base.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with renowned Chinese laparoscopic surgeons, Carina addresses numerous pain points in minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) with a modular and nimble robotic solution. The system provides surgeons flexibility to choose the best instruments and the most ideal anatomical access based on laparoscopy foundation. In this way, surgeons can leverage \u2013 rather than abandon \u2013 prior laparoscopic training and continue to improve upon their surgical performance, allowing for MIS in more surgical specialties to be performed robotically.\n\nThe innovative modular architecture of Carina minimizes equipment footprint to maximize utilization of precious OR space, thus becoming much more adaptable to typical OR environments in China. The surgical team can choose between 3-module or 4-module configuration depending on the expected complexity of the procedure, and the individual modules are freely mobile to join others as needed in different ORs. Surgeons can also choose from a full suite of instruments to arm each module. Ultimately, the fluidity in configuration translates to balancing clinical capability and procedural cost, resulting in improved usability for the surgical team, higher utilization for the hospital, and reduced economic burden on the patient.\n\nAltogether, the differentiated clinical capabilities and economic viability of the Carina system are poised to rapidly accelerate the adoption of robotic MIS in general surgery, gynecology, thoracic surgery, urology and other specialties. These specialties currently see nearly 10 million MIS patients annually in China, with 120,000 laparoscopic surgeons in over 10,000 hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely grateful to our investors for their confidence in Ronovo\u2019s strategy to democratize robotic surgery,\u201d said Dr. John Ma, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Ronovo. \u201cFrom inception, we have stayed true to our belief that innovation must start from an original pursuit to solve actual unmet clinical needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarina is designed with modular architecture to overcome the limited adoption of robotic MIS beyond urology,\u201d said Dr. Ying Mao, Co-Founder and CTO of Ronovo. \u201cThanks to the ingenuity and expertise of our talented team, we have achieved breakthrough in our core robotic technology for the Carina platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud to have led this round of financing in Ronovo and its innovative modular robotic platform, which will be first-to-market in China,\u201d commented Jiang Zhang, Founder and CEO of LRI \u201cWe are incredibly excited to partner with Ronovo to accelerate their product and clinical development, and we strongly believe in the clinical and commercial value of a modular robotic system as well as its viability for international adoption.\u201d\n\nWhile Carina was developed with Chinese laparoscopic surgeons as the use case, early discussions with robotic surgery KOLs in US and Europe indicate the system\u2019s strong potential to overcome current barriers of broad RAS adoptions in many international markets. Ronovo plans to continue discussions with clinical KOLs, strategic partners and global investors at upcoming conferences worldwide, including the LSI Emerging Medtech Summit, MedTech Strategist Innovation Summit, and Society of Robotic & Digital Surgery.\n\nAbout Ronovo Surgical\n\nFounded in 2019, Ronovo Surgical is accelerating the transition to truly intelligent MIS through innovative robotic and digital solutions.

We measured the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c during a single transit, with the extracted spectrum showing marginal evidence for wavelength-dependent transit depth variations which would indicate the presence of an atmosphere.\n\nForward modeling was used to constrain possible atmospheric compositions of the planet based on the shape of the transmission spectrum. Although L 98-59 is a fairly quiet star, we have seen evidence for stellar activity, and therefore we cannot rule out a scenario where the source of the signal originates with inhomogeneities on the host-star surface. While intriguing, our results are inconclusive and additional data is needed to verify any atmospheric signal.\n\nFortunately, additional data will soon be collected from both HST and JWST. Should this result be confirmed with additional data, L 98-59 c would be the first planet smaller than 2 Earth-radii with a detected atmosphere, and among the first small planets with a known atmosphere to be studied in detail by the JWST.\n\nThomas Barclay, Kyle B.

            "text": "By Ann Donohue\n\nScience fiction stories about the future generally go one of two ways: A dystopian hell where robots attack us (\u201cThe Terminator\u201d) or a dystopian hell where robots attack us in space (\u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d)\n\nBut now it\u2019s time to separate science fiction from fact. As the labor crisis continues in agriculture, with common-sense immigration reform at a standstill and an aging workforce threatening the future supply of skilled labor, technology will be one of the saviors of the industry.\n\nIn recent agricultural industry events\u2014from FIRA USA, the first American version of the international ag robotics expo that was held in Fresno, to the Alliance for Food and Farming Safe Fruits and Veggies farm tour across the Central Valley, to the Organic Grower Summit held last month in Monterey, Calif.\u2014the excitement about agtech was tempered by one recurring question: Does automation mean farmworkers will lose jobs?\n\nIt\u2019s a humane question, one based in the very worthy concern that individuals\u2019 livelihoods would be eliminated by technology. It\u2019s a variation on the dystopian theme that has populated our pop culture for decades.\n\nThe answer, thankfully, is no. In fact, in a scenario that might be counter-intuitive for a layperson\u2014automation doesn\u2019t replace workers, but it will actually improve workers\u2019 quality of life by making their specific jobs easier and giving them better paying opportunities down the road.\n\nAt FIRA, Hernan Hernandez, the Executive Director of the California Farmworker Foundation, gave a presentation on exactly this topic, noting that technology collaboration is the key to farmworker economic mobility as well as a way to improve safety on the job.\n\n\u201cWhen we were asking farmworkers \u2018What do you think about these new machines? What do you see? What is the future?\u2019 many of them were a bit scared\u2014but the majority of them said these machines are great and all, but they will never replace us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in our data\u2014a lot of farmworkers support technology. They think it is going to help them....In the Central Valley, the farmworkers\u2019 average age is 45 years old. This is a workforce that, five to 10 years from now, is going to need technology to help them with their day-to-day activities.\u201d\n\nFarmworker education\n\nHernandez says his organization is striving for a \u201cfree, fair, prosperous society\u201d and he believes farmworker education to assist with career development is key. To that end, CFF is working with the Fresno-Merced Future of Food Innovation (F3) coalition, which in 2022 received a $65.1 million grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration\u2014the largest grant ever received in the Central Valley\u2014to accelerate the integration of technology and worker skills.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I do want to emphasize is the workforce that we have today knows the fields,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lived in the fields, they\u2019ve worked in the fields for 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50 years. They know exactly what the terrain looks like and how to do the work. The one thing I would want to see is more farmworkers being included in the discussions so we can produce better technology that is safe.\u201d\n\nThat is exactly what is being done at HMC Farms in Kingsburg, Calif., according to Vice President Drew Ketelsen. \u201cWe will always need people\u2014we cannot function without them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut technology changes our ever-shifting landscape. Just like in many other industries, some job [categories] are lost and others are gained. There are new positions available in specialized areas in ag because of technology, allowing people the opportunity to pursue careers that didn\u2019t exist five years ago.\u201d\n\nThe best comparison to make is to think of what happened to switchboard operators as communications technology improved. Do those kinds of jobs exist in this day and age? Rarely. But did the mobile phone open up a whole new world of better-paying jobs in the same sector? Absolutely. Yesterday\u2019s switchboard operator is today\u2019s app designer.\n\nKetelsen\u2019s team now operates everything from flying autonomous robots to optical grading and sorting machines to Burro self-driving wheelbarrows to field moisture probes to help HMC\u2019s operations run more efficiently. \u201cAg technology is present in every aspect of our operation, from field preparation to harvest, packing to shipping, and everything in between,\u201d he said. \u201cAgtech doesn\u2019t always look like a scene from the future, it can be as simple as adding a power system to reduce the manual human effort required of an activity\u2014think of using a power drill rather than a screwdriver. Agtech is not about taking jobs away, it\u2019s about making jobs better for employees.\u201d\n\nAnd while the cool factor of ag robots is undeniable, there is a very serious business motivation for Ketelsen\u2019s push for technology at his operations.\n\n\u201cIf agriculture does not innovate, the job loss will be astronomical. In contrast with slowly losing some jobs to innovation, all jobs will be immediately lost if farm acreage is replaced with non-labor intensive crops, or pulled out of agriculture altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concern is about more than jobs, it is also about food security. Two-thirds of all the nation\u2019s fruits and nuts come from California alone. If we cannot find a way to provide healthy and affordable food, everyone will suffer.\u201d\n\nTwo-front fight\n\nFor Chris Rotticci, General Manager at Taylor Harvesting LLC, the fight for automation is on two fronts: to ward off the future inevitable collapse of the ag labor system\u2014and to make sure today\u2019s industry workers stay safe. Why use a ladder when workers can harvest from a mechanized raised platform that moves along the orchard row?\n\n\u201cHere, our emphasis and goal of automation is to improve our ergonomics,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we improve that work environment for the person that is actually doing the work? If we can build convenience into their working environment where they can improve their throughput, that\u2019s a win for everyone.\u201d\n\nAnd while automation will reveal new ag industry jobs over time, it also helps those workers who are employed today. Skilled labor done more efficiently means more money for the farmworker, Rotticci said. \u201cYou get into the compensation side, where it\u2019s either piece rate driven or a tiered bonus system,\u201d he said. \u201cI have safety bonuses weekly for the general labor we have. We have attendance bonuses\u2026we\u2019re shifting skill sets into a higher tier for higher returns.\u201d\n\nSo, as it turns out, when it comes to robots in the ag space, the most accurate science fiction tale is actually \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d No, automated harvesters won\u2019t be wearing maid uniforms and carrying feather dusters like Rosey the Robot.\n\nBut they will make sure that farm employees have a safer, more efficient, less physically rigorous way to do their jobs, all with the potential for greater career development.\n\n\u201cTo continue to do what we love, we have to evolve and adapt and welcome a few robots into our industry,\u201d Ketelsen said.\n\n[Ann Donohue is senior manager of media and content strategy for Western Growers.]\n\nSource: Western Growers",
