            "text": "You may not have known that space needs tugboats, but now you do \u2014 and Atomos Space just closed a $16.2 million Series A investment, which will enable the company to complete its demonstration mission where it will show off its docking and towing capabilities. The company is building a series of Orbital Transfer Vehicles (OTV) that makes it possible to reposition satellites in space. The theory is that, by making it possible to move flying objects into different orbits, they don\u2019t have to have full navigation capabilities themselves, which in turn should make operating spacecraft much cheaper. The company claims its existence effectively halves the launch costs of satellite operators.\n\nThe company is starting with high-powered electric propulsion systems, and is eager to share that it sees those propulsion methods as stepping stones for its nuclear OTV options, which would be able to travel faster and farther, and offering commercial mobility services. The company is also positioning itself to be able to use these technologies for asteroid deflection, effectively putting Harry Stamper out of a job.\n\n\u201cI worked on launch vehicle design, and then spacecraft propulsion system design and also some advanced technologies for moving around in space, and realized very quickly that how we do space logistics is sub-optimal. The best analogy that we use is with aircraft. Imagine you have a single-use plane, you are the sole passenger, and you have to take everything with you, unable to do shopping on the way. So if you want to drive around at your end destination, you need to take the car and you need to take gas with you,\u201d explains Vanessa Clark, CEO and co-founder of Atomos Space. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s very expensive and limited. What we really need is a hub and spoke logistics model for space. This allows us to do really cool things, commercial missions like Earth observation, global communications, broadband internet, but it also allows us to take the next step as a species and do more things in deep space that makes sense economically and from a scientific perspective.\u201d\n\nThis is the company\u2019s third round of VC funding, and so far it has built and tested on the ground, including its docking and propulsion systems. The next big step is to fly the first vehicle.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot of autonomy. We are working on having a self-driving satellite that can detect and navigate to a client and grab onto it safely. We have the ability to optimize our propulsion system for operating just in space, unlike a launch vehicle that also has to design for getting into space,\u201d Clark highlights the company\u2019s competitive advantage. \u201cThat means we can go farther and use less propellant. With this new round of funding we\u2019re finishing the build of our first two vehicles, and we have booked a launch in just under 12 months. It\u2019s going to be a really exciting mission, where we are flying two full-size commercial vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe first use cases of the technology is to take launched satellites to their final destinations and to reposition satellites mid-mission. When vehicles have reached their end of service, they can be moved to graveyard orbits, or disposal orbits so that they can burn up in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cOur goal as a company is to make any orbit as accessible as low Earth orbit (LEO). On Earth, if you want to send something overseas, it is as easy as sending a package to the next town over. You just go to the post office. We want that to be possible for space,\u201d explains Clark. \u201cWe want to be operating a fleet of orbital transit vehicles in Earth orbit that can provide the vast missions for a set of clients, spacecraft operators, Space Station operators and also companies and agencies that want to explore beyond the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe company is particularly excited about nuclear propulsion in space, and are investing heavily on that front, telling us it offers an order of magnitude improvement in speed and payload capabilities.\n\nWith the current round of funding, the company says it will double the size of the team and launch its first two OTVs in early 2024. The investment was led by Cantos Ventures and the Yamauchi No. 10 Family Office (that\u2019s the family that founded Nintendo), with participation from Upheaval Investments, Dolby Family Ventures, Arden Road Investments, Elefund and Techstars.",

            "text": "Researchers have created a miniature robot that can melt and reform back into its original shape, allowing it to complete tasks in tight spaces or even escape from behind bars. The team tested its mobility and shape-morphing abilities and published their results Wednesday in the journal Matter.\n\nWhile a melting, shape-shifting robot sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, the team actually found their inspiration in a marine animal here on Earth: a sea cucumber. Sea cucumbers \u201ccan very rapidly and reversibly change their stiffness,\u201d senior author and mechanical engineer Carmel Majidi of Carnegie Mellon University tells Science News\u2019 McKenzie Prillaman. \u201cThe challenge for us as engineers is to mimic that in the soft materials systems.\u201d\n\nTraditional robots are stiff and hard-bodied, so they can\u2019t always maneuver through small spaces. Soft robots, on the other hand, are more flexible, but they tend to be weaker and harder to control. So, to create a material both strong and flexible, the team created one that could shift between liquid and solid states.\n\nTo achieve this feat, the researchers made their robot out of a metal called gallium\u2014which has a low melting point of about 86 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014and embedded magnetic particles within it. Because of these particles, scientists can control the robots with magnets, prompting them to move, melt or stretch.\n\nThe magnetic particles also make the robots respond to an alternating magnetic field, or one that changes over time. This produces electricity inside the metal, raising its temperature. Using this magnetic field, \u201cyou can, through induction, heat up the material and cause the phase change,\u201d Majidi says in a statement. Then, ambient cooling causes the material to solidify again. The research team calls their invention a \u201cmagnetoactive solid-liquid phase transitional machine.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tests, the new robot could jump up to 20 times its body length, climb walls, solder a circuit board and escape from a mock prison. It could support an object about 30 times its own weight in its solid state, per the study.\n\nResearchers say this technology might have applications in the biomedical field. To show how, they used the robot to remove a ball from a model human stomach. The solid robot was able to move quickly to the ball, melt down, surround the ball, coalesce back into a solid and travel with the object out of the model. In this test, the researchers used gallium, but a real a human stomach has a temperature of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014higher than the metal\u2019s melting point. The authors write that more metals could be added to the material to raise its melting point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a compelling tool,\u201d Nicholas Bira, a robotics engineer at Harvard University who was not involved in the study, tells Science News. But while soft robotics researchers are often creating new substances, \u201cthe true innovation to come lies in combining these different innovative materials,\u201d he tells the publication.\n\nIn the future, the gallium robots could help assemble and repair hard-to-reach circuits or act as a universal screw by melting and reforming into a screw socket, the team says. Before the robot can be used in a living person, though, scientists must figure out how to track its position within a patient, Li Zhang, a mechanical engineer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who was not involved in the study, tells New Scientist\u2019s Karmela Padavic-Callaghan.\n\n\u201cFuture work should further explore how these robots could be used within a biomedical context,\u201d Majidi says in the statement. \u201cWhat we\u2019re showing are just one-off demonstrations, proofs of concept, but much more study will be required to delve into how this could actually be used for drug delivery or for removing foreign objects.\u201d",

            "text": "Asteroid mining has long caught the imagination of space entrepreneurs, but conventional wisdom has always been that it\u2019s little more than a pipe dream. That may be about to change after a startup announced plans to launch two missions this year designed to validate its space mining technology.\n\nThere are estimated to be trillions of dollars worth of precious metals locked up in asteroids strewn throughout the solar system. Given growing concerns about the scarcity of key materials required for batteries and other electronics, there\u2019s been growing interest in attempts to extract these resources.\n\nThe enormous cost of space missions and the huge technical challenges involved in mining in space have led many to dismiss the idea as unworkable. The industry has already seen one boom and bust cycle after leading players like Deep Space Industries folded after investors lost their nerve.\n\nBut now, California-based startup AstroForge has taken concrete steps toward its goal of becoming the first company to mine an asteroid and bring the materials back to Earth. This year it will launch two missions, one designed to test out its in-space mineral extraction technology and another that will carry out a survey mission of a promising asteroid close to Earth.\n\n\u201cWith a finite supply of precious metals on Earth, we have no other choice than to look to deep space to source cost-effective and sustainable materials,\u201d CEO and co-founder Matt Gialich said in a statement.\n\nThe company, which raised $13 million in seed funding last April, is planning to target asteroids rich in platinum group metals in deep space. These materials are in major demand in many high-tech industries, but their reserves are limited and geographically concentrated. Extracting them can also be very environmentally damaging.\n\nAstroForge is developing mineral refining technology that it hopes will allow it to extract precious metals from these asteroids and return them to Earth. A prototype will catch a lift into orbit on a spacecraft designed by OrbAstro and launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in April. It will be pre-loaded with asteroid-like material, which it will then attempt to vaporize and sort into its different chemical constituents.\n\nThen in October, the company will attempt an even more ambitious mission. A 220-pound spacecraft also designed by OrbAstro, called Brokkr-2, will attempt an 8-month journey to reach an asteroid orbiting the sun about 22 million miles from Earth. It will carry a host of instruments designed to assess the target asteroid in situ.\n\nBoth of these missions are precursors designed to test out systems that will be needed for AstroForge\u2019s first proper asteroid mining mission, expected later this decade. The company plans to target asteroids between 66 to 4,920 feet in diameter and break them apart from a distance before collecting the remains.\n\nEven if these missions are a success, there\u2019s still a long road towards making space mining practical. According to research AstroForge recently conducted with the Colorado School of Mines, the bulk of metal-rich asteroids are found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, which is currently a 14-year round trip.\n\nNonetheless, off-world mining does appear to be having somewhat of a renaissance, with dozens of space resources startups springing up in recent years. If AstroForge succeeds in proving out its technology this year, it could give this fledgling industry a major boost.\n\nImage Credit: NASA",

            "text": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2023 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Iridium IRDM, Maxar MAXR and EchoStar SATS.\n\nIndustry: Satellite & Communication\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2043842/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-satellite-and-communication-industry\n\nGlobal macroeconomic weakness, inflation and supply chain issues could affect growth prospects of the Zacks Satellite and Communication industry in the near term. Nonetheless, the companies within this industry are well-poised to benefit from a vast proliferation and cheaper access to space technology in the long run. This trend is leading to a diversification in end-market users. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data have given rise to multiple use cases across industries like oil and gas, agriculture, transportation and non-governmental organizations.\n\nGeopolitical competition in space as a contested domain is leading to further investments by global militaries. Iridium, Maxar and EchoStar have significant growth potential on global security threats, surging defense budgets and demand for high-quality imagery and value-added services.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Satellite and Communication industry comprises space technology companies that provide satellite imagery, intelligence services and spacecraft and robotics for space exploration, research and national security. They help customers understand and navigate the evolving planet, deliver global broadband communications and explore space.\n\nThe industry players provide communication services to media businesses, fixed and wireless telecommunications operators, data networking providers and Internet service providers. They also offer commercial satellite communication services to government and military organizations. The firms offer satellite-based consulting and technical services, including the lifecycle of satellite operations and infrastructure, ranging from satellite and launch vehicle procurement to telemetry and commanding services.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's Shaping the Industry's Future\n\nAdvancements in Technology Hold the Key: There has been a radical change in highly specialized satellite manufacturing patterns. More emphasis is put on using common buses and computer-aided design tools to customize the communications payloads. A mass-produced system is adopted and several satellites are manufactured in an assembly line. Integration and testing have become highly automated.\n\nThe extent of testing is reduced after prototyping and initial production is completed. Countries with comprehensive space programs have distinct military, economic and scientific advantages, but complexity and barriers to entry into space have allowed only a few to develop notable capabilities. The demand for small satellites across regions is expected to increase over time, with North America having the bulk of the market share, followed by the Asia Pacific, Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nNorth America maintains its dominance with the highest number of small satellite launches by government end users. The companies continue to align their products and services with the U.S. Department of Defense's National Defense Strategy needs and growing international defense and intelligence demand.\n\nSubscriber Momentum to Drive Growth: Wide proliferation and cheaper access to space technology have diversified end-market users. The companies share a strategic relationship with various government organizations, including military and disaster response agencies and non-governmental organizations, to provide robust, tactical, real-time voice and low-latency data command and control communications.\n\nA wide product portfolio enables companies to expand their customer base and offset the losses from one product category with benefits obtained from another. Also, high product quality increases brand loyalty and enhances performance in a competitive market.\n\nFor civil customers, particularly NASA, growth is being driven by space exploration programs. For commercial customers, growth drivers include a strong demand for imagery due to new use cases, space-based remote sensing, Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit replacement demand and Low Earth Orbit communications programs. Also, personal satellite communications are witnessing strong demand leading to subscriber growth.\n\nSpending on Space Infrastructure Could be Affected By Macroeconomic Weakness: With more than half of the revenues coming from U.S. government customers, the industry is likely to benefit from increasing defense and space infrastructure budgets. The proliferation of space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and communications is expected to boost government investments in the sector.\n\nThe companies are developing differentiated capabilities designed for future space exploration, including propulsion, power and robotics. These elements will be critical for helping their customers achieve successful space exploration missions. Focus on research and development and product and service enhancements is a key strategy for innovation and growth. However, weakness in global macroeconomic conditions could compel customers to lower spending, which does not bode well for industry participants.\n\nPersistent supply chain issues, component shortages and rising inflation could lead to higher costs and increased lead time, which are major concerns. The inflow of capital investment to this particular industry has been reducing due to interest rate hikes and investor uncertainty amid a broader market slowdown. Many industry participants are likely to find the present investment situation highly challenging.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Satellite and Communication industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It currently has a Zacks Industry Rank #186, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few satellite and communication stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms Sector, S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Satellite and Communication industry outperformed the S&P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector in the past year.\n\nThe industry has lost 4% over this period against the S&P 500's decline of 8.8%. The broader sector has plunged 17.5%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nThe Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio is commonly used for valuing satellite and communication stocks. The industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 9.61X compared with the S&P 500's 12.17X. The sector's trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA stands at 9.44X.\n\nIn the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.93X and as low as 7.48X, with a median of 10.19X.\n\n3 Stocks to Watch in the Industry\n\nIridium Communications: Iridium provides mobile voice and data communication services and products to businesses, the United States and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers. The company delivers mission-critical services across various industries, allowing its business to remain resilient despite headwinds.\n\nIridium's performance is benefiting from higher demand in services and engineering and support business segments. Services revenues are driven by a growing subscriber base owing to robust demand for consumer-oriented devices.\n\nIridium expects the voice and data business to gain from the increasing demand for newer services like Push-to-Talk and satellite Wi-Fi for smartphones. Continued momentum in the commercial IoT business (particularly personal satellite communications) and broadband business (especially L-band services) augurs well.\n\nIridium recently announced that it had signed an agreement with Qualcomm Technologies to allow satellite messaging and emergency services in smartphones powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon Mobile Platforms. The service is expected to be available in premium Android smartphones in select regions starting in the second half of 2023.\n\nIridium carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            "text": "A novel robotic arm will carry samples from Mars and transport them back to Earth, according to a statement released by the European Space Agency (ESA) on Thursday, Jan. 26.\n\nDuring the mission to bring samples of Martian soil back to Earth, a European robotic arm of 2.5 meters in length will pick up tubes containing the dirt and transfer them to a rocket for a historical cosmic delivery.\n\n'Sample Transfer Arm'\n\nAs featured on Interesting Engineering, the Sample Transfer Arm (STA) robot is essential to the success of the Mars Sample Return mission. It can operate without human intervention and is said to be quite dependable and sturdy, making it a good fit for a one-of-a-kind task such as this.\n\nWith the help of two cameras and a plethora of sensors, the robot can produce a wide variety of motions with seven degrees of flexibility. And as described by ESA, it has a gripper, which is like a hand to grab and handle the sample tubes at diverse angles.\n\nHowever, the robotic arm has not yet arrived on Mars. While NASA's Perseverance rover is now gathering samples from the surface of the Red Planet, the ESA has announced that the SAT will soon land there to retrieve the tubes.\n\nESA explained that the arm's ability to see, feel, and take autonomous judgments and a high degree of dexterity enable it to remove the tubes from the rover, pick them up off the Martian ground, place them into a container, and shut the lid before taking off from Mars.\n\nAlso Read: Bear on Mars? NASA Captures a Beast-Like Face on the Red Planet\n\nMartian Endeavors\n\nLast February, the Mars Perseverance rover celebrated one year on the Red Planet. As planned, NASA's $2.7 billion robotic explorer Perseverance was gently released on the alien planet on February 18, 2021.\n\nSince the 1970s, when NASA first began investigating the possibility of life on Mars, this event marks the agency's most concerted and comprehensive endeavor to date. Collecting a wide range of samples for return to Earth for further research supports that effort.\n\nThe robotic device will link up with the ESA's Earth Return Orbiter (ERO), which will collect the canisters containing samples from Mars and return them to Earth. Samples from the expedition, a collaboration between NASA and ESA, are expected to return within the next decade, in 2033 at the earliest.\n\nLife on Mars\n\nThe organizations anticipate finding fossilized remains of extinct creatures among the samples. They also mention the very low likelihood that any biological creatures are present in the specimens.\n\nBut because of the increased risk of biocontamination, this raises the issue of whether or not it is safe to transport such microbes back to Earth.\n\nThe agencies have previously claimed that the possibility of bringing back live organisms is very low and that the risk of human contamination of Mars' clean, unspoiled environment is equivalent to Martian contamination of Earth.\n\nAlso Read: Japan Seeks to Explore if AI-powered Robotic Seals Can Relax Astronauts\n\n\u24d2 2022 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

            "text": "With another year over and more global issues to address, not only are there many technologies and innovations to reflect on this year, but there are also exciting new developments on the horizon for 2023. Year in Review: 2022\u2019s Top New and Emerging Technologies Article from | Knight Optical\n\nFrom energy solutions, 3D printing, extended reality and genomics to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and even smarter devices, 2022 has been a hive of activity in the worlds of science and technology.\n\nJust visit the news section of our website, and the many pages of blogs on new innovations are a testament to the bustle that\u2019s been taking place across various industries this year. Catch up on our blog series here.\n\nWith global issues, such as the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, the fight against climate change, lingering concerns surrounding COVID-19 \u2013 as well as new worries about recent outbreaks of Group A streptococcus (Strep A) and what\u2019s currently been described as the world\u2019s worst-ever outbreak of bird flu \u2013 new devices and research and analyses systems have been launching in every corner.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with one of the more widely publicised stories of 2022 & how optics and laser technology plays a part.\n\nViewing outer space through a new lens\n\nThis year, astronomers far and wide sat tight anticipating a long-awaited announcement from NASA. On Christmas Day in 2021, the $10bn James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) launched after many delays. Despite the challenges faced with launching the JWST, which included \u201cunpacking manoeuvres\u201d and \u201cunfurling its tennis court-sized sunshield\u201d1, the telescope captured its first collection of images in early July 2022.\n\nCaptivating the world, the JWST first released its primary full-colour \u2018deep-field\u2019 image, known as \u2018SMACS 0723\u2019, which depicts light magnification and distortion of objects behind galaxy clusters. Following this announcement, four more images were unveiled the very next day, which includes shots of nebulae, a galaxy constellation, and the atmospheric spectra of an exoplanet.\n\nHuman Or Robot?\n\nDesigned by robotics company Engineered Arts, Ameca went viral in 2022 when the humanoid was revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2022 at the start of the year. What\u2019s being described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced humanoid robot\u201d, Ameca can smile, blink, frown, and make other expressions that are uncannily like a human\u2019s mannerisms.\n\nBuilt based on 3D scans of real-life people, Ameca not only imitates expressions but also has similarities when it comes to bone structure, skin texture and frown/wrinkle lines. Currently, Ameca runs on pre-programmed, life-like movements, and doesn\u2019t make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). While, the British robotics company doesn\u2019t predict official models for another 10 years, Ameca is a fantastic candidate for our list of 2022\u2019s biggest technological breakthroughs.\n\nThe Future of Aviation?\n\nFollowing the sales of electric cars reaching a high in 2021, and their continued popularity this year, it comes as no surprise that the waves this technology has caused are rippling into the aviation sector.\n\nThere are three noteworthy mentions in this category that have made impressive strides towards a greener future for the aviation industry. Firstly, British luxury car manufacturer and aero-engine manufacturing giant Rolls-Royce revealed some record-breaking developments for its electric aircraft demonstrator, ACCEL. An acronym translating into \u2018Accelerating the Electrification of Flight\u2019, the ACCEL aircraft achieved a world-record all-electric flight of 345.4mph. Although the flight officially took place in 2021, 2022 was the year that it was verified as a \u2018record\u2019 by the World Air Sports Federation2.\n\nUp next is Eviation\u2019s electric commuter airplane, Alice, which took its very first flight at the end of September 2022. Flying above Washington and hitting a speed of about 171mph, Alice was air bound for a total of eight minutes. Intended to carry nine people, the aircraft aims to \u201creimagine regional travel\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, in May, another electric aircraft made impressive headway. Envisioned for logistics use, for cargo purposes, Beta Technologies\u2019 Alia made a journey that rounded up to 1403 miles. Stopping and starting along the way, as it would if used for delivery dedications, Alia started in New York on May 23rd and made its final stop on May 30th in Arkansas after seven stops in total.\n\nElectric-Powered Vessels\n\nElectric methods of transportation seem to be taking the spotlight in our yearly round-up. From the road and the sky to the sea, EV-powered vehicles, aircraft, and boats are being revealed throughout all corners of the globe.\n\nFor example, Swedish company Candela\u2019s P-12 Shuttle (not pictured) is an electric passenger vessel that strives to offer \u201cconvenient cross connections in waterfront cities\u201d. The brand also claims that this method of transport isn\u2019t only eco-friendlier but is \u201con many routes, a faster alternative to cars\u201d. Working on \u2018computer-stabilised hydrofoils\u2019, the P-12 Shuttle provides passengers with the smoothest on-water experience and claims to be \u201c400% more energy efficient than any other fast vessel3\u201d. By hydroplaning, Candela\u2019s vessels use less power than conventional boats require.\n\nAutonomous Vessels\n\nEqually as inventive as Candela\u2019s electric vessels, the AI-captained autonomous marine research ship, The Mayflower, is the first of its kind. Equipped with IBM technology, The Mayflower is designed to gather ocean data surrounding the impact of climate change and was set to follow the original three-mast Mayflower\u2019s transatlantic route. Working with marine research and exploration specialist ProMare to co-engineer the boat\u2019s software, IBM equipped the self-operating ship with three layers of tech. This includes: \u2018sensory inputs\u2019, \u2018real-time machine learning and analytics\u2019, alongside a \u2018decision engine4\u2019.\n\nThis year, on June 30th, the Mayflower successfully arrived at Plymouth in Massachusetts after a voyage across the Atlantic from Plymouth in the UK!\n\nUltracold Chemistry\n\nOf course, alongside the high-tech breakthroughs that we\u2019ve witnessed in 2022, there are also tremendous scientific developments that are certainly notable in the often-intertwined realms that we work in of science and technology.\n\nWith a profound presence in the chemistry sector, we often observe some incredible firsts that are often challenging for scientists to achieve. This year, as mentioned in Physics World\u2019s \u2018Biggest Breakthroughs of the Year\u2019, a group of professionals from educational institutes in China and America have created the first ultracold polyatomic molecules, which was previously difficult to achieve when \u201ccontaining three or more atoms5\u201d. As Physics World explains this \u201cpaves the way for new research in both physics and chemistry\u201d.\n\nA Year to Celebrate\n\nHere at Knight Optical, we supply our optical components and knowledge to all the above industries and more, working on custom and stock optics for everything from experimental breakthroughs in cutting-edge labs through to larger, game-changing AI- and sensor-powered devices on vehicles, ships, and planes as well as revolutionary spaceborne systems and forward-thinking robotics.\n\nWhy Choose Knight Optical for your Application?\n\nDiscerning customers rely on Knight Optical not only for the premium quality of our output and in-house state-of-the-art Metrology Laboratory and QA Department\u2019s capabilities but because \u2013 as well as a range of Stock Optics (available for next-day dispatch) \u2013 we also offer our optics as Custom-Made Components.\n\nWith over three decades of experience under our belt and a host of long-standing world-renowned customers on our books, we are proud to have worked on some of the most ground-breaking innovations.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed our blog about 2022\u2019s top technology and how optics and laser technology plays a huge part in these advancements.

            "text": "Despite taking a beating (down 16%) past year, iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF IRBO has gained 17.4% past month, breezing past the S&P 500\u2019s return of 4.5% and the Nasdaq-100 ETF QQQ\u2019s 9.7% gains.\n\nRobots and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly gaining precedence in our daily life. First, the pandemic-driven stay-at-home trend made it more important as we have become more dependent on the technology. Now, the growing accessibility and falling costs are also making the space more demanding and lucrative.\n\nThe global AI market size is projected to grow from $387.45 billion in 2022 to $1394.30 billion in 2029 at a CAGR of 20.1% in the forecast period, per Fortune Business Insights. AI adoption surged mainly in the healthcare sector. Compared to 2019, a bumper 150% increase in market growth was observed during the peak of the pandemic in 2020. Apart from healthcare, retail, ecommerce, logistics, and transportation have also been deploying AI.\n\nHow Hot Artificial Intelligence as An Investing Area?\n\nEven though Wall Street is off to a great start to 2023, investors\u2019 sentiments are still wavering. Tech layoffs have been intensifying. Still, BuzzFeed BZFD rose about 120% on Jan 26 as company plans to use AI to create content. The stock added about 11.5% after hours. This stock performance explains AI\u2019s investing worth at the current level.\n\n\"We must look ahead and shift our business towards longer term trends in order to seize the opportunities that will come in the eventual recovery,\" Said BuzzFeed CEO Peretti, as quoted on Yahoo. Artificial intelligence can basically transform the productivity and GDP potential of the global economy, per PWC. PWC\u2019s research reveals that 45% of total economic gains by 2030 will come from product enhancements, boosting consumer demand.\n\nThis will be possible because AI will bring about product variety, with increased personalization and affordability. The maximum economic benefit from AI will be in China (26% boost to GDP in 2030) and North America (14.5% boost), per PWC.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few artificial intelligence ETFs that are great bets now.\n\nETFs in Detail\n\nThe ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF ROBO\n\nThe ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF is the first ETF in the space, following the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index, which measures the performance of companies which derive a portion of revenues and profits from robotics-related or automation-related products or services.

A spokesperson at the Port deferred questions to Plus One. Nieves did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPlus One is among a growing number of tech companies to lay off employees. Silicon Valley-based tech giants that have offices in Central and South Texas, mostly in Austin, have announced workforce cuts since the start of the new year: Google, Microsoft and Amazon all have announced they would lay off employees.\n\nRELATED: San Antonio\u2019s growing robotics scene draws national attention, invitation to exhibit at big U.S. show\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, has said it will lay off more than 220 workers in Austin as part of its plans to cut 11,000 jobs, or 13 percent of its workforce. Tesla Inc., the Austin based electric-car company led by Elon Musk, reportedly said it has a freeze on hiring and plans to lay off workers in the first quarter.\n\nPlus One, which was founded in 2016, has garnered a reputation among tech leaders as one of the city\u2019s most successful technology startups.\n\nThe company boomed during the pandemic as businesses increasingly turned to automation to deal with labor shortages, including workers who were sick with COVID-19, and to minimize the risk that the virus would invade their workplaces.\n\nIn a July meeting on the Port, SATX Robotix \u2014 a group of technologists working on autonomous vehicles, drones and industrial robots who meet to network and present new tech in their fields \u2014 touted Plus One as one of its top players.\n\nREAD MORE: Plus One Robotics raised $33M from investors\n\nIt raised $33 million in venture capital in 2021 and doubled the space it occupied by adding 15,000 square feet at its Port headquarters. The provider of warehouse and logistics robotics had plans to expand its headquarters again here while continuing to hire in the U.S. and Europe.\n\n\u201cPlus One Robotics has doubled every couple of years,\u201d Shaun Edwards, co-founder of Plus One, said during the meeting.\n\nEdwards did not immediately respond to request for comment Friday morning.",

            "text": "Event cameras mimic the human eye to allow robots to navigate their environment, and a new approach helps minimize computational costs.\n\nAnimals\u2019 eyes are extremely efficient, and researchers have been trying to reproduce their function in robots for many years. However, despite the latest improvements in artificial intelligence, a computer\u2019s visual data processing still cannot compete with the speed and accuracy of biological visual systems.\n\nWhen it comes to the visual perception of autonomous robots \u2014 think self-driving cars and drones, which need to accurately \u201csee\u201d their surroundings \u2014 one of the fundamental issues is motion estimation. How can we make sure that our robot correctly perceives the three-dimensional movement in space of objects in motion?\n\nOne way to get around this issue is using event cameras, which are basically bio-inspired sensors that produce motion information to give a robot a sense for depth and movement. These \u201crobotic eyes\u201d generally offer an advantage compared to the traditional video cameras we are all familiar with, as they allow for better visual efficiency, speed, and accuracy, even in the dark.\n\nHowever, this increased accuracy comes with an increased computational cost, which slows the system down, effectively cancelling the speed advantages they provide.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, researchers Shintaro Shiba and Yoshimitsu Aoki from Keio University in Japan, and Guillermo Gallego from the Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster at TU Berlin, Germany developed a new method that allows robots to estimate motion as accurately as before without compromising speed.\n\nIt utilizes event camera data, just like the previous method, but also uses something called \u201cprior knowledge\u201d, a sort of robotic common sense that automatically removes data that is deemed \u201cunrealistic\u201d, thereby lightening the process and reducing computational effort. This discovery is important for future research and may find applications in areas such as driverless cars and autonomous drones.\n\nSilicon retinas\n\nOften called \u201csilicon retinas\u201d, event cameras mimic the visual system of animals \u2014 a bit like the photoreceptor cells in the human retina, each pixel in an event camera produces precisely timed outputs called events, which differs from still images we are all familiar with generated by conventional cameras.\n\n\u201cThe cameras naturally respond to the moving parts of the scene and to changes in illumination,\u201d said Gallego, head of the Robotic Interactive Perception laboratory at the Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster (TU Berlin).\n\n\u201cEvent cameras offer many advantages over their traditional, video-based counterparts, such as a very high dynamic range, resolution in the order of microseconds, low power consumption, and data redundancy suppression,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe work on designing efficient motion estimation methods, which comes with great challenges.\u201d\n\nTrade-off between accuracy and estimation\n\nEven if the event camera is fast, as a complex system, a robot doesn\u2019t always process information as fast as the sensor does, because its slow algorithms create a bottleneck in data processing.\n\nTherefore, what happens is that existing motion estimation methods for event cameras tend to be either accurate but slow, or fast but inaccurate. The techniques that make these algorithms stable are often computationally expensive, which makes it difficult for them to run in real-time.\n\nTo solve this issue, Shiba, Aoki, and Gallego have improved a framework called Contrast Maximization that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on motion estimation without sacrificing execution time.\n\nThe key idea being that some motions are more realistic than others, and this can be used as additional information in the framework. The experimental results show that the proposed method is two to four times faster than previous approaches.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated an application of the proposed method that estimates time-to-collision in driving scenarios, which is useful for advanced driver-assistance systems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started by analyzing failure cases that did not produce realistic motion speeds, caused by the existence of multiple sub-optimal solutions,\u201d said Shiba, a Ph.D. candidate and author of the study. \u201cContrast Maximization is a useful motion estimation method, but it needs additional computing workload to run stably in certain scenarios, such as when the robot is moving forward. We tried to find the root cause of the failure and managed to measure the failure based on geometric principles of the visual data.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the researchers were able to quantify the failure by calculating how fast the images in the camera change in size (which would suggest that the object is getting closer or moving away).\n\nUsing this measurement, the proposed method prevents the failure cases in question. \u201cEvent cameras have a great potential, and with this method, we can further leverage this potential and get a step closer to real-time motion estimation,\u201d said Aoki, Professor at the Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering of Keio University. \u201cOur method is the only effective solution against these failure cases without trading off workload, and this is a critical step towards mobile-robot applications for event cameras and the Contrast Maximization framework.\u201d\n\nImproving driverless cars\n\nThe researchers applied the method to estimate one of the most important parameters in autonomous driver scenarios, also known as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems or ADAS, namely time-to-collision. The camera, placed in the car, computes motion information faster than before, and warns the driver before collision.\n\nAnother way the method has proven useful is the estimation of scene-depth information if the vehicle\u2019s speed is known, which gives the car a better visual accuracy.\n\n\u201cThrough our latest work, we have now moved one step further, and we are excited to achieve even faster algorithms and real-time applications on autonomous robots. We aim to make them just as fast and accurate as flies\u2019 or cats\u2019 eyes,\u201d said Shiba.\n\nIn the next phase of their research, Shiba, Aoki, and Gallego plan to extend the method to more complex scenes, such as multiple independently moving objects, like a bird flock or maybe even crowds of people.\n\nReference: Shintaro Shiba, Yoshimitsu Aoki, and Guillermo Gallego, A Fast Geometric Regularizer to Mitigate Event Collapse in the Contrast Maximization Framework, Advanced Intelligent Systems (2022).
