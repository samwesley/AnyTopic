            "text": "If we were to look at the information screens at departures at any major Indian airport, we are likely to see a familiar pattern: Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah appear repeatedly on the flickering displays.\n\nMany Indians have started using Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Sharjah airports, to connect via the UAE to flights bound for Europe, North America, Africa or elsewhere in Asia. Now that the UAE has become India\u2019s gateway to the world, the two countries are also developing a strategic alliance that could reshape geopolitics across South Asia and the Middle East.\n\nRelations between India and the UAE are on the rise in recent years. A lot has to do with the efforts of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the rulers of UAE and their respective and very capable core teams.\n\nThe UAE is home to one of the largest groups of Indians. For decades, many Indians have remained in the UAE and have forged strong cultural and family ties to the area.\n\nAccording to figures from Central Bank of the UAE, annual remittances sent home by Indians in the UAE top the list of non-resident remittances to India. Indian FDI into UAE, and UAE FDI into India is significantly on the rise in recent years.\n\nDubai, which is UAE\u2019s most populous city, is now an international trade and business hub and has already positioned itself to be among the best globally. Dubai has decided to have its economy organized around four pillars: trade, transport, tourism, and technology.\n\nSoftware, business and professional services and education have recently been the top sectors for India-based investment going into the UAE.\n\nThe UAE and India\u2019s mutual appreciation for society is set to get stronger in the coming years. In February 2022, the UAE-India comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) was signed and officially entered into force three months later. The agreement was the first of its kind signed by India in the Middle East and North Africa region, and the first for the UAE with any country globally.\n\nIndia has also agreed, for the first time, to set up an Indian Institute of Technology in the UAE.\n\nRobotics has successfully taken over the global tech market by storm with automation and artificial intelligence. There is already an AI race at an international level. There is a robot race where different countries compete with each other with government funds and tech companies.\n\nIt is in this area where India and UAE look like ideal complementing partners who can mutually leapfrog into the fourth pillar of the economy \u2013 technology. All the possible synergies in this friendship and partnership match up.\n\nAccording to a study done by Oracle, the UAE, India and China are taking a rapid lead in the global adoption of robotics\n\nUAE is already using robots extensively in hospitals, for surgeries, in pharmacies, in banks, for public services such as police, on beaches, to make car licence plates, to clean metro stations and many other activities.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, is well-known for its academic programs that are focused on technology. Focusing on robotics as a discipline, India has become a great place for robotics studies, technology, research & development, and prospective applications. India also has tremendous potential to implement robotics in the manufacturing sector.\n\nWith initiatives such as Make in India, robotics as a prominent player continues to draw global investments to India, transforming it into a genuine pillar of robotics expertise.\n\nOn their part, the governments of both India and the UAE are doing their share of easing the path to speed up the acceleration of the fourth industrial revolution in this region. The government-private-public partnership would need to rise to the occasion to look at more medium to long-term strategies which could focus, among other areas, in the field of robotics.\n\nThe UAE already has a national strategy for artificial intelligence 2031, with a very capable young minister handling this portfolio. Dubai, on its part, has launched The Dubai Robotics and Automation Program, which was launched recently by the Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed. The Crown Prince also called on various government entities and the private sector to strengthen cooperation with local and international research and academic institutions to develop a regulatory and legal environment that supports the growth of the robotics and automation sector.\n\nIndia and its government and private sector can play a major role by setting up entities which can assist in training, grooming and mentoring the young emiratis to scale up rapidly in this area. People who have lived in this region are well aware of how intelligent, capable and tech-savvy the younger generation of emiratis are. Over time, they would become a force to reckon with. If large Indian private sector firms and groups who are based in the UAE create forward-thinking programs which help both nations, the benefits could be huge and far-reaching for the people of both nations.\n\nIf specially designed programs of international standards are created by Indian institutes, both in India as well as in UAE, specifically to speed up Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, the multiplier effect could be huge.\n\nWhile the pillars of trade, transport and tourism would continue to get focused upon and grow, the India-UAE synergies in the field of technology, AI, robotics and manufacturing are mind-boggling. Both countries are well poised to work as brothers and friends, on equal terms.\n\nIndia should recognize the fact that, in the future, among its hub cities, some could be outside India. UAE is certainly encouraging that.\n\nAnd within India, it should reciprocate the same for the UAE.\n\nThe author is the Consultant Director of TEXUB and a member of the UAE Superbrands Council. He has also served as the CEO for the EROS group, and has rich corporate experience working with organizations, such as SKF Bearings, and HSBC.\n\nRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

PHINXT\u2019s cloud-based platform helps small to medium-sized warehouses compete with larger logistics companies by increasing their automation and adoption of robotics.\n\nNow the London-based startup has raised over \u00a3600K in a pre-seed round. The investment came from top VCs and angels, including the exited founder of autonomous systems startup Wayve, Amar Shah through his new deep tech VC Dhyan Ventures.\n\nOther investors included Fuel Ventures, Atlas Ventures, APX, Prequel Ventures, and angels from Venture Together and Alma Angels.\n\nThe funds will be used by PHINXT Robotics to field test their first product and run it successfully in a first group of customers\u2019 warehouses.\n\nCofounder and CEO, Yanwen Chen, PhD, said, \u201cRobotics automation has become a must for businesses that want to stay competitive in the logistics and manufacturing industries, however, it is still something that only large companies are able to afford. We are changing that and, thanks to our tech, we plan to bring the advantages of robotics automation to many SMEs across Europe in the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nTom Hibbard, Principal at Fuel Ventures, said, \u201cPHINXT is a deep tech company that also has short-term commercial potential. They are one of the rare startups that has deeply technical founders who are extremely focussed on their customers and their needs. We\u2019re really pleased to be backing this team.\u201d\n\nAmar Shah, the founding partner at Dhyan Ventures, said, \u201cTo benefit from automation in warehouses, robots need sophisticated real-time coordination. PHINXT delivers exactly that without the need of a large engineering or research team, helping the smaller players stay competitive amongst giant organisations. As a founder in the robotics space, I can see the vast potential for their technology and am excited to join them on their journey to scale.\u201d\n\nBrainchild of experienced founders\n\nPHINXT Robotics was founded in 2022 by Yanwen Chen and Quirino Zagarese, experts in autonomous systems. Yanwen Chen has two PhDs in Computer Science focused on logic models for cyber-physical systems and large-scale robotics synchronisation. Quirino Zagarese has a Ph.D. in Software Engineering with a focus on service computing for ultra large-scale systems.\n\nThe London startup enables warehouses of any size to deploy autonomous robots as needed, with no expertise required. PHINXT has already patented its decentralised edge computing technology, which enables ultra-simplified deployments that require minimal IT infrastructure costs. Due to its patented decentralised edge computing technology, PHINXT allows for ultra-simplified deployments that require minimal IT infrastructure while ensuring unprecedented levels of reliability.\n\nAs a result, small and medium-sized warehouses will have easier access to robotics and be able to compete with the larger logistics companies as well as scale up or down robot numbers as necessary. In addition, PHINXT can provide interoperability between any type of robot to build fully autonomous ecosystems.",

            "text": "Wera screwdriver kit Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nI have a lot of screwdrivers. My favorite set for repairing tech gadgets is my trusty iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit, but that set has so many parts that I'm reluctant to take it out and about with me in case I drop it, forget it, or have it stolen.\n\nAlso: 3 security gadgets I never leave home without\n\nThis compact Wera screwdriver kit solves all that. Here's a screwdriver kit I can pop into a pocket or bag, and not compromise on quality or power.\n\nAnd this screwdriver has some cool hidden tricks.\n\nFirst, it can go from a stubby to a long screwdriver (and back again) with the press of a button.\n\nMagic! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nThis is super handy for tackling a variety of jobs. I was a little skeptical of this feature initially because I worried it would make the screwdriver flimsy, but it doesn't.\n\nIt gives me all the flexibility of a small screwdriver, and the ability to turn it into a bigger screwdriver for heavier jobs.\n\nAlso: These are my 3 must-have Raspberry Pi accessories\n\nThe mechanism is super strong and reliable. I've leaned into this screwdriver with all my weight -- I'm a big bloke -- and it didn't budge.\n\nThe other hidden feature is the handle is home to six screwdriver bits, hidden away in a compartment that you access by pressing a button on the top.\n\nHere's the button Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nPress and pop!\n\nPress and POP! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nThe bits in the handle are securely stored, so nothing rattles about!\n\nThe six bits in the handle of the Wera screwdriver are securely held in place Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nI love this design. It's small enough for me to pop into my pocket for jobs where I know that I'll only need a screwdriver -- things like changing a graphics card or swapping out a lock on a door -- but it's versatile enough so I can be ready for anything.\n\nThe screwdriver is also magnetic, having a \"just right\" amount of magnetic pull -- enough to keep a fastener on the bit, not so much that it's being pulled all over the place inside a PC or some other delicate bit of kit.\n\nThe magnet is strong enough to be useful, and not too strong as to be annoying Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nThis screwdriver excels in a place where a lot of \"multi\" screwdrivers fail -- it's really tough. Despite the built-in mechanisms for the shank and handle, it feels very much like a regular screwdriver in the hand.\n\nSix bits not enough for your needs? That's what I thought!\n\nSo, not wanting to the lacking in the screwdriver bits department, I also got the 30-piece bit set I can pop in my pocket along with the screwdriver if I think I'm going to need more. This has a very good selection of slotted, Torx, hex, Phillips, and Pozidriv bits.\n\nThese bits are hard-wearing and excellent quality.\n\nAll in all, this is a great kit. The screwdriver is better, stronger, more versatile, and not much bigger than those multitools that people carry (in all honesty, I think this is a better alternative to expensive multitools for a fraction of the money), and even adding the extra bits doesn't add much in the way of cost or bulk to the kit.",

            "text": "Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nSelf-driving trench diggers. Drones that digitally re-create buildings. Roomba-like devices that outline where every beam on a floor should go. The construction site of the future is already here as homes, office buildings and industrial sites go up around the country. Robots that can lay bricks, put up drywall and tie rebar are pitching in at a time when the construction industry is in major flux.\n\nMeanwhile, start-ups are pouring even more resources into the field, including building robots that survey and monitor, as well as heavy machinery that can operate on its own. They are hoping to automate a complicated field involving moving parts and vastly different sites and buildings.\n\n\u201cConstruction robots are a great example of how robotic technology is going to touch people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Matthew Johnson-Roberson, the director of the robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cMany [construction] jobs \u2026 that exist today are now going to be alongside robots.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFueling the wave on innovation is a construction crisis. Building costs are rising, and hundreds of thousands of jobs remain unfilled. Those who are in the industry are getting older and working under sometimes deadly conditions. Amid that, federal money is pouring in to build better infrastructure.\n\nThe confluence of factors have created a situation where more construction firms are turning to robots to automate work on job sites. Still, the flurry of activity caused several workforce experts to become concerned that it could lead to job losses, or a situation where people who work alongside these robots are left working more quickly and in more unsafe work environments.\n\nRobots are no strangers in the industry. Amazon uses a slew of robots in its operations, from the Roomba-like Kiva that moves packages, to Sparrow, which grasps things with humanlike finesse. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nElon Musk has notoriously promised he would automate Tesla\u2019s manufacturing and recently unveiled the prototype humanoid robot Optimus, aiming to reshape physical work. Google recently showed robots that are fueled by artificial intelligence to help humans with everyday tasks. Some robots are even learning how to cook fries.\n\nBut the dynamics in construction have been different, Johnson-Roberson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig-scale projects, such as dams, bridges and roads, have seen quicker adoption of robotic technology, because the tasks are usually more defined and require less finesse. The home-building industry has been slower, because much of the tasks require fine motor control, which robots have had a harder time doing, he added.\n\nStill, it\u2019s unlikely that construction sites will see humanoid robots walking around job sites hammering nails into pieces of wood, Johnson-Roberson said. Rather, advances in laser range-finding technology, artificial intelligence software, robotic hardware and sensors will probably be put to use in automating big tasks, such as digging, surveying, pouring concrete and moving large items around.\n\n\u201cThis is not artificial general intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not like we can do everything or it acts like a human. It really is \u2014 new pieces of heavy equipment that now have much better sensors and can do things that humans would have had to do\u201d using multiple cumbersome steps.\n\nFor Noah Ready-Campbell, the chief executive of Built Robotics, the path to building a construction robot was natural. He grew up in a construction family, often working summers on job sites and hating it. After growing up, he did a stint at Google and sold a clothing technology start-up to eBay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016, he started his company, which created a machine called an exosystem that fits onto the back of trench diggers, such as big Caterpillar machines. The exosystem is outfitted with cameras, sensors and machine-learning software, and plugs into the machine\u2019s onboard computer.\n\nIt becomes the eyes, ears and brain of the excavator, and it can run without anyone operating it. Most of the companies using Built Robotics\u2019 system these days are renewable energy companies, such as solar farms, Ready-Campbell said. Often, these companies have land far from large cities, making it hard to recruit talent, and the digging that needs to be done is repetitive \u2014 ideal for automation, he said.\n\nThe company has raised $112 million to date, with $64 million of that coming in April. Ready-Campbell said his company could not have existed a decade ago, because it needed the cheaper sensors, spurred in part by smartphone and self-driving technology, better cameras and gains in artificial intelligence algorithms that have only cropped up in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe tech would not have worked\u201d a decade ago, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of different parts of our tech stack that weren\u2019t available.\u201d\n\nOther construction start-ups include Australia\u2019s Fastbrick Robotics, which builds a mobile robot called the Hadrian X that can lay up to 1,000 bricks an hour. Pennsylvania\u2019s Advanced Construction Robotics builds robots that can tie up to 1,100 rebar intersections an hour. Canvas, founded in San Francisco, has a mobile robot that finishes drywall.\n\nTessa Lau, the chief executive of Dusty Robotics, built her construction robotics firm after remodeling her own home. During that process, she realized how many steps were involved and that there was room for error nearly everywhere, causing potentials for delay.\n\nShe had a background in artificial intelligence and robotics, and studied the construction industry, and realized one of the areas that could be automated was the physical sketching out of a home or office floor to tell builders where each beam needs to be nailed or plank needs to go.\n\nTo do that, her company created a Roomba-like device that prints an outline on the actual floor of the building project. Instead of people using chalk lines, they upload digital designs into software that directs the Roomba where to go within 1/16th of an inch of precision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company rents it out for a subscription that runs roughly $240,000 per year, Lau said. As of last year, the company was valued at roughly $250 million and has customers such as Turner Construction.\n\nLau said she is aware of the concern that robots might take jobs on the construction site but noted that more construction workers are retiring as fewer join the trade. That\u2019s creating a crisis for construction companies, she said, who need a way to do the work during the talent shortage.\n\n\u201cOur robots are taking jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to meet the world\u2019s demand for housing and infrastructure is if we build robots to take away those jobs, because people are not filling those jobs.\u201d\n\nNik Theodore, the director of the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois in Chicago, said the robots could hold promise if they can automate the rote, often injury-plaguing and deadly tasks construction workers have \u201cin a very dangerous industry with large numbers of fatalities.\u201d\n\nBut the concern, he said, is \u201cthe temptation\u201d for automation to speed up job tasks and increase worker fatigue, leading to a situation where burnout and injuries occur more, not less.\n\nIt could \u201ctake a solution that could make the worksite less dangerous,\u201d he said, \u201cand in fact, make it more dangerous.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "Hugo and Erica Briones, like thousands of other homebuyers in North Texas, are waiting patiently for their new home to be built \u2014 but their home is different.\n\nUnlike most of the 48,000-plus new homes that began construction in Dallas-Fort Worth last year, the Briones\u2019 1,700-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bathroom house is one of only a few in the region built using a new method of construction, concrete 3D printing.\n\nA handful of builders across Texas, large and small, are using giant automated machines to \u201cprint\u201d homes, layer by layer, within weeks if not days. The \u201c3D printers\u201d control nozzles spouting concrete mix based on programmed coordinates, similar to a desktop 3D printer but at a much larger scale. They only require a small crew to operate.\n\n\u201cWe decided to look around and compare prices, and we figured out that a conventional house is way more expensive than doing it this way,\u201d Erica said.\n\nHugo Briones, center, poses for a portrait with his wife Erica and children Emily, 13, left, Elena, 9, front center, and Elisa 4, in front of their custom-built 3D-printed house. They are the buyers of one of the first 3D-printed homes being constructed in Texas. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nBuilders and other experts in the local housing market say the technology could help avert labor shortages and supply issues and provide more affordable homes than traditionally built homes.\n\n\u201cIn the race to satisfy the demand [for affordable housing], the quality of construction is going down,\u201d said Sebin Joseph, chief technology officer and co-founder of Dallas startup Von Perry, which is printing a home for the Brioneses. \u201cThe only way you can remedy that situation is by implementing automatic construction, which is far faster and superior than conventional construction.\u201d\n\nPhil Crone, executive director of the Dallas Builders Association, said he could see 3D-printed homes become a much more substantial part of the market in 15 to 20 years as technology advances and labor issues continue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s every market incentive in the world for the built environment to find less labor-intensive options that don\u2019t involve just a traditional stick-frame, lumber-centric framing process that we\u2019ve done for hundreds of years,\u201d Crone said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see 3D printing jump into that arena.\u201d\n\nThe space is rapidly evolving. In Houston, Germany-based Peri 3D Construction and Houston-based engineering firm Cive are building what is believed to be the country\u2019s first 3D-printed home with two floors, NPR reported.\n\nStill, 3D home printing is far from ready to be deployed at a scale that would rival lumber-built homes. Very few printers are available for builders to use and the process itself has not yet been perfected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly got a ways to go before it can build at the intricacy needed for most of today\u2019s modern home plans,\u201d Crone said. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee it being the majority of homes anytime soon, but it is definitely a technology to watch.\u201d\n\nCutting costs\n\nThe Brioneses sold their house in Plano about two years ago hoping to build a new home for the first time. They already had a spot in mind next to Erica\u2019s parents\u2019 home in the small town of Nevada in Collin County, which they saw as a quieter, calmer place to raise their family.\n\nThe family looked around for traditional builders to compare costs, but they found them to be too expensive. Then, about a year ago, Erica\u2019s brother Gerardo Alvarez, an architectural student at the University of Texas at Arlington, introduced them to a young entrepreneur he works as a designer who had a solution.\n\nTreyvon Perry, 22, had dropped out of UT Arlington at the end of 2021 to focus on Von Perry, a company he started when he was just 17 years old. The company originally centered around designing homes using different types of sustainable materials, but later realized the cost to actually build those homes would be too high.\n\nTreyvon Perry is CEO and founder of Von Perry. The firm is using a 3D printer to construct a home in the small town of Nevada in Collin County. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nIn 2020, Perry started researching 3D printing and decided to fully adopt the technology to build homes while also exploring the use of sustainable materials in the process.\n\n\u201cWhen people think of Von Perry, they think of us just as a 3D-printing company,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWell, no, that\u2019s not really our mission. Our goal is to produce sustainable infrastructure and bring it to the mass market at an affordable price.\u201d\n\nThe Briones family started talking to Perry about how much more affordable, efficient and resistant to the Texas weather the home would be. For the Brioneses, the 3D-printed home cost about $200,000, while a smaller traditionally built home would have cost more than $300,000. The family also looked at mobile homes, but decided the concrete-printed home would be a much better deal.\n\nPrinting kicked off in November. Hugo, a machine operator in McKinney, said he has been telling his coworkers about the home, and that they are already interested in visiting the house and even wanting to submit an application to build their own. The Brioneses\u2019 home will be fully complete in March.\n\n\u201cAll the people that I talk to about the home, they like the idea and the price and everything,\u201d he said.\n\nVon Perry has two other projects in the design phase as it continues to experiment with the technology. The company is looking into using recycled plastic for interior walls and printing using different materials than simple cement in the future.\n\nTom Bugg, left, of Kitchen Logistics LLC consults with Treyvon Perry, CEO and founder of Von Perry, about designing a kitchen for a home the company is constructing with a 3D printer in Nevada, Texas. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nPerry was originally looking into manufacturing the machines, but decided that would be too costly and time-intensive and chose to focus on buying printers made by others and act essentially as a project manager. The company is currently using a printer made by Minnesota firm Total Kustom.\n\nBut relying on third parties for the printers presents another challenge, the extraordinarily small number of them available in the country, which Joseph says is \u201cprobably less than 10.\u201d That, in addition to weather, led to delays in printing their first house for the Brioneses.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of rainy days and very cold days when the mix wasn\u2019t working very well on, because that the printing should be in an optimal temperature,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cSo we had to figure out all those things.\u201d\n\nOut by the lake\n\nCraig Pettit, president of MRB Robotics, stands inside one of his 3D-printed houses in Mabank. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nIn Mabank, a small town along Cedar Creek Lake southeast of Dallas that has seen an influx of builders looking to build affordable homes, another small business called MRB Robotics has already completed two 3D-printed homes.\n\nThe company\u2019s founder, Craig Pettit, previously worked in data processing and has been fixing and flipping homes as a side gig for more than a decade. While looking into building new homes in late 2020, a friend sent him an email about the concept of 3D concrete printing.\n\n\u201cI felt like with my computer science and construction background, I\u2019d be in a unique position to get a head start on the new technology,\u201d he said.\n\nMRB Robotics has now built two three-bedroom homes in Mabank using a 3D printer. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nPettit\u2019s printer is a prototype he bought from another manufacturer and has since modified. Even with it being new technology, he said he expected the printer to work right out of the box like a paper printer but found that many different factors from structural to mechanical to weather can get in the way. It takes practice to perfect the process, he says.\n\n\u201cThe trick is that the speed of the printer has to match the speed of the pump,\u201d Pettit said. \u201cIf the printer is moving faster than the pump, the wall will be too thin. If the printer is moving slower than the pump, the wall will be too thick.\u201d\n\nPettit started printing his first three-bedroom house in Mabank in November 2021 and got to work on another home the following month. The first home took 10 days to print, and the second took just six days, followed by four to five months for a general contractor to finish them with a roof, utilities, windows and doors.\n\nA resident started leasing the second house about two to three months ago, and the first is on the market for $1,500 per month, said Pettit.\n\nThe nozzle of the 3D printer adds a layer of concrete on the walls of a self-storage facility by MRB Robotics in Payne Springs. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nNow, Pettit is finishing a 14-unit self-storage facility just outside of Mabank in Payne Springs, which he started working on in August 2022. While factors such as rain and stopping to make some engineering changes created some delay, he said that in ideal conditions he could have printed the facility in a week.\n\nPettit plans to continue printing houses and self-storage facilities and is looking into a project to build a \u201cretail village\u201d in Highland Village that could start as soon as the third quarter of this year.\n\nHe also plans to start another home in Mabank in February, and by the end of 2023, he expects to begin selling his own machines to small- to mid-sized homebuilders that he says \u201cwill be as easy as opening a box and printing a house.\u201d\n\nInterior of the first 3D printed house by MRB Robotics in Mabank. Owner Craig Pettit opted not to smoothen out the concrete material to instead create a unique loft-style look. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nPettit said that because 3D printers can form houses in any shape, designs are possible that would be very costly using traditional construction methods \u2014 like a 25-foot wave wall with vase-like contours he printed as part of the storage project. He says his homes are also more resistant to floods, wind, termites, mold, fire, noise and heat.\n\nThinking big\n\nOne of the earliest and biggest players in the 3D building-printing space was Austin-based Icon that has raised $451 million since its inception in 2017.\n\nThe company has printed 3D homes and structures across the U.S. and Mexico, from market-rate homes to disaster-relief housing, military barracks and homes for the homeless. Icon even has contracts with NASA to build research and develop construction systems for infrastructure on the moon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really got to fundamentally be reimagining what is possible in a future with machines that can work around the clock,\u201d said Dmitri Julius, Icon\u2019s chief of special projects. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve got a consumer housing problem, but we also have this broader global housing crisis that\u2019s impacting humanity, and I don\u2019t think any of us are comfortable with the current solutions.\u201d\n\nIcon is printing 100 new homes with Lennar at the Wolf Ranch community in Georgetown, a suburb of Austin. The homes were co-designed by global architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group. (Icon)\n\nIn November, Icon and publicly traded homebuilder Lennar said they had begun construction of a community of 100 3D-printed homes within the Wolf Ranch master-planned community in Georgetown, a suburb of Austin, using a fleet of their Vulcan 3D printers.\n\n\u201cFor us, this represents the beginning,\u201d Julius said. \u201cHouses by the thousands and tens of thousands is what we believe these printers will be able to deliver in the future.\u201d\n\nLennar developed the land and handled the foundation for the homes. Icon\u2019s 3D printers, using a proprietary concrete mix called Lavacrete and controlled by an iPhone or iPad app, will deliver all the home\u2019s walls. Lennar\u2019s traditional trade partners will then install a roof, finish out the interiors, deliver appliances, install electrical systems and do the landscaping.\n\nEach is co-designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group, which is based out of Denmark and New York City. The three- and four-bedroom homes range from about 1,600 to 2,100 square feet of living space and will start in the mid-$400,000s \u2014 around the same price as nearby traditionally built homes. Reservations begin this year.\n\n\u201cThe fit, finish and fixtures in these homes are going to be equal to if not better than the houses that you\u2019re used to seeing in your normal, everyday master-planned community,\u201d Julius said. \u201cThese are ready for primetime.\u201d\n\nCharlie Coleman, Austin division president for Lennar, said he first met Icon founders Evan and Jason Ballard just over two years ago after seeing them present 3D-printed tiny homes at the South by Southwest conference in Austin.\n\nColeman said the technology could help the company build high-quality homes more affordably and more efficiently with fewer workers on site.\n\n\u201cI think this could really help by introducing some technology to help fill in a gap where we just don\u2019t have enough of our trade partners and our labor to build, certainly in our market,\u201d he said.\n\nA fleet of 3D printers construct the walls of new homes in the Wolf Ranch residential community in Georgetown. (Icon)\n\nBalda, who has led Dallas-based Hillwood Communities for more than 30 years, said he was quick to jump on board when Lennar approached his company with the idea of working with Icon in their Wolf Ranch neighborhood, seeing it as a solution to the supply chain and labor challenges that have ravaged the industry.\n\n\u201cThe last couple of years and homebuilding has been horrendous for many reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought this technology might help address some of those issues that we\u2019re all seeing.\u201d\n\nBalda said the concept of concrete homes made by a giant printer wasn\u2019t too far off from homes already built on concrete cinder blocks in Florida to withstand hurricanes, making it easy for him to digest the idea. The development veteran said he hopes to bring 3D-printed homes to other communities in North Texas, but is not in talks to do so quite yet.\n\n\u201cWe need all these different ideas to come to the marketplace to help address the supply issue that we\u2019re currently dealing with.\u201d",

            "text": "Houston-based Nauticus Robotics\u2019 first production Aquanauts and Hydronauts will head into the wild and closer to full commercialization this year, with testing planned in Norway and in the Gulf of Mexico. Founder and CEO Nicolaus Radford discusses the past few busy years for the tech start-up.\n\nIt\u2019s been a relatively fast journey for Nauticus. Set up in 2014 (as Houston Mechatronics Inc), the company has been a bit of an outsider in the offshore industry, against incumbents offering (for the most part) more traditional looking underwater robotic systems.\n\nHowever, the third quarter of 2022 saw the company (whose investors include Schlumberger (SLB) and Transocean) complete a business combination with CleanTech Acquisition Corp., netting it nearly $60 million to fund its first fleet of ocean robots; list on the Nasdaq exchange; agree a trial with energy giant Shell; win a contract with the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit; and agree a defense related partnership with tech giant Leidos.\n\nIt now has three of its second-generation Aquanauts in build in Vancouver, which will be used on trials in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Norway, and two Hydronaut uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), which will act as launch and recovery systems and surface gateways to Aquanauts, in-build in the UK.\n\nCEO Nicolaus (Nic) Radford, who set up the firm in his living room eight years ago, doesn\u2019t hold back his ambition. Innovation has been \u201cmind numbingly slow\u201d in the offshore industry, he says. Part of Nauticus\u2019 ambition is to \u201cput an adrenaline shot\u201d into it, by taking robotics technology developed for space flight into the ocean.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to have a network of Aquanauts and Hydronauts out there working, a whole Navy of them, being controlled by control centers around the world, out there 24/7 doing their thing. That's the core of the business. There's an ocean of opportunity to take advantage of,\u201d he says, from fisheries to countering global security threats, which have heightened recently, with increased underwater surveillance to protect critical infrastructure, such as pipelines and communications cables.\n\n\n\nImage courtesy Nauticus\n\n\u201cI'm fired up as you can as you can possibly get about this industry and I think there's so many different facets to move into,\u201d he says. \u201cFrankly, it's huge. It's enormous, it's completely front and center right now. It's the epicenter for all of our resources, right? Food, minerals, energy.\u201d\n\nThat adds up to an estimated $2.5 trillion marine economy, of which some $30 million could be addressable the types of ocean robotics it\u2019s building, according to Nauticus.\n\nBorn in Illinois, Radford graduated with a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering then joined NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Centre and pretty much went straight into robotics, including DARPA sponsored programs, before moving to Houston, working with United Space Alliance and then Oceaneering Space Systems as a contractor to NASA, again in robotics.\n\n\u201cAt NASA I learned a ton of stuff, but uncovered this idea that there was meaningful change to be made in the ocean domain,\u201d he says. \u201cI had had some exposure to the ocean world before and remember the first time I saw an ROV I was like, OK, that's cute, but we can do so much better. Then you realize they don't want to do any better.\u201d\n\nA part of the problem is incentives and the ability to disrupt. \u201cSome of the big incumbent players have very successful businesses, but it ties them to certain incentive structures,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're paid by the hour, you do not want fewer hours. So, Schlumberger (who he\u2019d worked with at NASA) sort of challenged me, what would you do about this? I said we need to create a hybrid vehicle. We need to be able to have an AUV turn into an ROV, because we actually don't need an umbilical. It was a flash in the pan idea, and so you know we garnered some investment.\u201d\n\nRadford had also been working with Transocean on some drilling software and they were interested in the idea too; so they had their first investors. Since then, US government contracts, from the Navy, especially, have been a strong driver. It\u2019s meant that, over the past four years, Nauticus has developed and tested a significant amount of technology \u2013 most of which they\u2019ve not been able to publicize, says Radford.\n\n\u201cMy proudest moment was when we did a fully autonomous demonstration and I was taken to the side by our customer and they basically said \u2018that was the most advanced stuff they\u2019d ever seen\u2019. We essentially had an autonomous mission that occurred over about 20 minutes of action where the robot was able to pick up a tool, assess it, figure out a way to operate it, figure out a way where that tool could be operated on. We just put the robot in the water, we hit the on switch and sat watching with cups of coffee and it worked. We were almost crying! It was incredible.\u201d That was two years ago in a test tank environment \u2013 they\u2019ve not been able to share the video, he says.\n\nSince then, testing has been in the real-world, including Lake Travis in Austin, but also coastal areas. \u201cWe have some milestones coming up which will stress that (capability proven two years ago) probably by a factor of 10,\u201d says Radford. The Aquanauts are also getting closer to commercial work. Three (second generation) production Aquanauts are in build at International Submarine Engineering in Vancouver. A couple of them are due to head to the Tau Autonomy Center in Norway to qualify \u201ccertain actions\u201d for a couple customers. One will be doing some pilot work in the Gulf of Mexico in mid-2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy dream is to have a network of Aquanauts and Hydronauts out there working, a whole Navy of them, being controlled by control centers around the world, out there 24/7 doing their thing. That's the core of the business. There's an ocean of opportunity Nicolaus Radford, founder and CEO, Nauticus Robotics. Image courtesy Nauticus\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019ll go out with a lot of autonomous capability under their belts, says Radford. \u201cThat work (with the US Navy) has meant being able to build up thousands of kilometers and hours of dive time on their autonomy software,\u201d says Radford. It\u2019s also meant building a commercial and defense variants of Aquanaut. \u201cThose two platforms are in the water every single day, diving, collecting data, building out behaviors, to deploy to the production systems, so we don't have to wait till they come up the assembly line to build out their usable action. It\u2019s a library we've been building for years now.\u201d\n\nThe offshore pilot with Shell, planned for mid-2023, will focus specifically on testing Aquanaut\u2019s ability to deploy a robotic tool, for carrying out inspections on pipelines. Currently, this tool can only otherwise be placed with an ROV, for which a fully crewed ROV vessel is needed, which \u201cwould be overkill\u201d for the work it\u2019s doing. Part of the qualification work for this tool deployment includes supervised autonomy and tool control using Nauticus\u2019 acoustic communication networking technology.\n\nThis is wrapped in with wider over the horizon communications \u2013 terrestrial and underwater \u2013 to support the ability to operate without an umbilical. While satellite communications are there, the rollout of the likes of Starlink will provide more inexpensive ways to transmit more data to the surface, says Radford. For through-water communications, Nauticus has been working with Schlumberger, from whom Nauticus has licensed use of an underwater modem previously tested from a DriX USV to receive video from an AUV. It\u2019s also been work with Singapore-based Subnero.\n\nSubnero has been developing software defined underwater acoustic modems for communications, networking, navigation and monitoring, which it calls Wireless Networked Communications (WNC). Recent testing with Nauticus has included the ability of their WNC to dynamically adapt to provide the best performance in a given environment.\n\nConcurrently, Nauticus is building, through Diverse Marine in Cowes, UK, an 18 m, aluminum-hulled, SMART-Gyro (from Golden Arrow) stabilized USVs called Hydronaut, which will act as a transport, recharge and communication gateway for Aquanaut. Nauticus has an agreement with Diverse to build 20 Hydronauts, with the first two initially scheduled for completion in Q1 and Q2 2023. The rest are expected to include Jones Act compliant builds via Diverse Marine\u2019s USA-based shipyard partners.\n\n\n\nArtist rendering of the Hydronaut.

It will be initially flagged to MCA Workboat Code and optionally uncrewed, because \u201cwe don't want to be limited by any regulations,\u201d says Radford (an approach others are also taking with many countries having different regulations), \u201cso it has accommodation for four crew. That will allow it to travel about 160 nautical miles from a safe harbor with its crew.\u201d\n\nThe firm is also commercializing the manipulator it designed for Aquanaut as a standalone product to sell. \u201cBuilding Aquanaut was like a moon shot engineering activity and there was a bunch of spin out technologies that are finding their own independent revenue streams, whether it's the software stack called Toolkit that runs everything or all the way down to just the manipulator,\u201d says Radford. \u201cThere weren\u2019t really any electric manipulators in the market, so we decided to fill that gap made our first delivery to IKM (in Norway).\u201d That\u2019s been through some development work with IKM and now the first production batch has now started, he says.\n\nEarlier this year the firm also agreed to work with Stinger AS, a specialist underwater technology firm, also in Norway. The details of that are being worked on, says Radford. Nauticus also had an agreement with Triumph Subsea, a new company that had announced various plans for a new breed of greener offshore vessels. There is still a contract with them, but delivery dates have been pushed out, he says Radford.\n\nWhile there have been delays \u2013 building the Hydronauts has been hit by delays getting hold of aluminum \u2013 Radford is fired up. \u201cWe are here to make the biggest impact in the ocean economy through the deployment of this robotic navy,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we\u2019ve also transitioned to a public facing entity, we\u2019re on the NASDAQ and everyone here is fired up about it.\u201d\n\nHe also hopes that Nauticus\u2019 investment will be part of a wider surge in investment in the ocean space, which spending has been dwarfed by other sectors, not least space technology. There are also barriers to entry \u2013 the cost to develop ocean technology, for example. But Radford hopes to overcome that, finding both funding and willing partners.\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "With winter upon us and temperatures dropping, many of us are looking for ways to keep warm without breaking the bank. Heating an entire home or apartment can cause power bills to rise. Sometimes you only need to heart the area in which you are in while using a lot less power in the process. Dreo\u2019s Solaris Max Space Heater is designed to get that job done.\n\nWhat Is the Dreo Solaris Max?\n\nThe Solaris Max space heater is produced by Dreo and designed to heat a space quickly and with less noise than traditional space heater. The device has three different modes and three different heat settings to fit your particular needs. It can be used to heat the room you are currently occupying so you can run the home heating unit at a lower temperature. No need to heat rooms that no one is using. It also is great for heating a room at work. The Dreo Solaris Max space heater is currently available directly from the Dreo store on Amazon and sells for $84.99. There is currently a 10% discount which takes the price of the Solaris Max down to only $76.\n\nProduct Components and Specs\n\nHere is what you get in the box:\n\n1 Dreo Solaris Max Space Heater\n\n1 Remote Control\u200b\u200b\n\n1 CR2025 Lithium Battery\u200b\u200b (in remote control)\n\nThe Solaris Max stands 24 inches high and has a 8 inch diameter base. This small footprint takes up less space than traditional boxy heaters. The Pilot Max also has a modern look which fits in with most d\u00e9cor. When running, this space heater is fairly quiet at just 37.5 decibels. It heats up to 75\u2109 in just 2 seconds and puts out warmth at 10 feet per second. A digital display at the front of the top of the heater shows the current mode and setting. Touch sensors on either side of the display form the control panel. The included remote control has all of the same functions as the control panel on the heater. In addition, you can also silence the beeps when pushing the buttons on either the remote control or the control pad on the fan with the mute button.\n\nHow to Use the Dreo Solaris Max\n\nThe Solaris Max is ready to use out of the box. There is no assembly required. Just unpack the space heater, plug it directly into a wall outlet, not a power stirp or extension cord, and the space heater is ready to go.\n\nUsing either the remote control or the controller on the Solaris Max, you can cycle through 3 different modes with the mode button. In Power Heat mode, you can select from three heating levels: H1, H2, and H3 which adjust the power of the heating element between 700W, 900W, and 1500W respectively. In this mode, the Solaris Max will run at that level constantly. You can cycle through the levels by pressing the \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2018 buttons. Economy is the second mode. It will heat up a space to a set temperature, automatically adjusting the power levels. Once it reaches the desired temperature, the heating element turns off and the fan continues to run to circulate the air. The heating element then turns on as needed to maintain the set temperature. The desired temperature can be selected using the \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2018 buttons and ranges from 41\u2109 to 95\u2109 which can be adjusted in 1\u2109 increments. This mode uses higher power levels at the start and as the room approaches the desired temperature, the Solaris Max goes to a lower power level until the desired temperature is reached. The Fan Only mode just runs the fan with no heat. This is useful if the space is getting too warm or if you just want to circulate the air without additional heat. by pressing the \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2018 buttons.\n\nThe Solaris Max also allows you to set a timer for the space heater to run before it shuts off automatically. The timer can be set in one hour increments from 1 to 12 hours. Just press the timer button on the control panel or remote control to cycle through the options. When the timer runs out, the heater will shut off automatically. When not using the timer, the Solaris Max will automatically shut off after 24 hours. Whenever the space heater turns off, it will always run the fan for 30 seconds after the heating element deactivates in order to help cool down the unit. In order better heat an entire room, the space heater can rotate back and forth. You can turn on oscillation by pressing the corresponding button. Once this has been turned on, the heater will rotate through a 70 degree arc.\n\nWhy You Should Get the Dreo Solaris Max\n\nOur family has used space heaters for a number of years. While we have a whole house HVAC unit that works well, sometimes there is no need to heat the entire house if only one room is currently being used or the inhabitants of an area would like it a bit warmer than the rest of the house. I have had the opportunity to use other products by Dreo and have been impressed by both their design and function. When I received the Solaris Max right as the weather was turning cold, I had high expectations. Once I started using it, I was not disappointed. The Solaris Max uses Dreo\u2019s patented air duct technology, the same as used on some of their fans and air purifiers. This allows the space heater to cycle air efficiently while not making much noise. Also, the ability to circulate air helps heat up a space faster than a traditional radiant heater without a fan.\n\nThe power heat mode with the three different levels works great when you are trying to heat a part of a much large space such as in a large unheated room or garage. It also works great on a patio. For rooms of 100 to 270 square feet, I really like the economy mode. I am actually using it as I write up this review in my office at home and it is keeping me at a comfortably warm 74\u2109. With the economy mode, I don\u2019t have to worry about changing the power setting as I get too warm or cold. I just set it at the temperature I want and it stays at that level without any additional attention from me.\n\nOne of my concerns when using a space heater is the danger of fire. The Solaris Max has some great safety features to address this. First there are sensors on the PTC ceramics of the heating element as well as the case. If the temperature ever exceeds 158\u2109 on the PTC ceramics or 122\u2109 on the case, the device will automatically shut down. This also keeps the case from getting too hot to touch. Since the Solaris Max has a tower design, there is a chance it could get knocked over. Once again, Dreo has installed sensors for this purpose. If the unit ever tips more than 45 degrees from vertical in any direction, the space heater automatically shuts down the heating element and then runs the fan for an additional 30 seconds to help cool down the unit before turning off. Since I am curious, I tested this out. While I did not knock the space heater over, I leaned it over in two different directions and each time as it approached horizontal, a \u2018P4\u2019 appeared on the display, the code for tip over protection, and the fan begin cooling down as the fan ran for half a minute.\n\nMy family and I have been impressed with the Solaris Max. It meets all of our qualifications for a space heater in that it is easy to use, it has safety features, and it efficiently heats the room where it is being used. During the holidays our adult daughter and her husband used it in the guest room to keep the room a bit warmer than the rest of the house for our grandson. I use it in my office and even in the master bathroom so I don\u2019t step out of the shower to a cold room. The Solaris Max is powerful enough to heat most rooms in a home. Dreo also offers other space heaters for smaller spaces with many of the same features. If you are in need of a space heater, then I recommend the Solaris Max by Dreo.\n\nCheck out the Dreo store on Amazon for more information and to make a purchase.\n\nYou can also watch this video to learn more about the Dreo Solaris Max space heater.\n\nDisclosure: GeekDad received a sample of this item for review purposes.\n\nLiked it?
