            "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 Inside the Sears think[box] innovation center on the campus of Case Western Reserve University, three aspiring entrepreneurs are applying their engineering skills, along with considerable energy and chutzpah, to the vexing problem of microplastics.\n\nMax Pennington, a recent CWRU graduate, and seniors David Dillman and Chip Miller, have co-founded CLEANR Inc. to design a washing machine filter that will prevent microplastics in the wastewater from being discharged into the sewer.\n\nIt\u2019s a partial solution to a worldwide menace.\n\nMicroplastics have been making their way into rivers and streams, and showing up in our drinking water for a long time, creating health hazards that the medical community is only now beginning to understand. They are miniscule scrapings from discarded plastic bottles exposed to the elements, or flecks of tires rubbed free by friction with the road.\n\nThey are also tiny fibers shed from clothing and other fabrics while being thrashed about in a washing machine. This is where CLEANR hopes to make a difference.\n\nThe company\u2019s three co-founders, friends who met at the Signa Chi fraternity on campus, coalesced around the idea of designing a filter after Pennington returned from an internship with Proctor & Gamble in Cincinnati. There he learned about the massive volume of microplastics that result from the everyday routine of doing laundry.\n\nThe prospect of building a filter began to consume them. Not just any filter, but one that removes a considerable amount of fibers, that\u2019s easy for manufacturers to install on their machines and that consumers will find easy to clean.\n\nIt\u2019s a formidable challenge, they learned from manufacturers, given the likelihood of clogging.\n\n\u201cSo, we thought about it as a really cool engineering problem that needed to be solved,\u201d said Miller, an Atlanta native who built a five-letter typewriter when he was 10 years old.\n\n\u201cAs a kid I would build anything I could imagine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three men won\u2019t say much about their design other than it was inspired by nature and that it\u2019s mechanical, with a patent pending on their technology.\n\nDillman, a mechanical and aerospace engineering major, designed the first prototype, which was little more than a small plastic box with a hole through it and a piece of mesh on the inside.\n\nEventually, the intrepid inventers used computer-aided design and 3D printers provided for free at the think[box], a maker space open to the public, to develop the various iterations of their design.\n\nGunk built up after10 loads of laundry. Startup company CLEANR is trying to develop a filter that will remove microplastics from the wastewater discharged from washine machines.CLEANR Inc.CLEANR Inc.\n\nLab testing\n\nLast year they were awarded $5,000 for coming in second in \u201cVenture Track\u201d category of the annual Morgenthaler-Pavey Startup Competition hosted by CWRU\u2019s Veale Institute of Entrepreneurship. They used part of the money to buy the company\u2019s first washing machine \u2013 an LG model - that could be used to lab test their filter. CLEANR has also installed a filter in the washing machine at the Sigma Chi fraternity house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice, stressful environment to test the filter,\u201d Pennington said.\n\nCLEANR\u2019s efforts have been aided by experienced advisors, including Terry Moore, a former senior managing director at Accenture who went to Emory University with Miller\u2019s father, a cardiologist who sits on the CLEANR board along with Moore.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really smart engineers and they\u2019re great idea people,\u201d Moore said of Pennington, Dillman and Miller, and very good at taking an idea from concept to prototype.\n\nMoore said he traveled to Europe \u2013 once with Pennington and a second time with all three co-founders \u2013 to visit washing machine manufacturers and potential component suppliers. CLEANR hopes to have a market-ready filter by Jan. 1, 2025, which is when France will begin requiring all new washing machines to have filters to remove microplastics.\n\nMoore said he expects other countries to follow France \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d and that some U.S. states, including Oregon, are also flirting with similar regulations.\n\nFilters are not standard on washing machines sold in the United States or Canada, said Jill Notini, spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers in Washington, D.C., but the industry is hoping to better understand the concern about microplastics and how its members should respond.\n\n\u201cWe want the solution to be both acceptable and easy for the consumer, and also sustainable,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the filter needs to be cleaned, \u201cthink about what that looks like,\u201d she said. Wet? Goopy? Sticky?\n\n\u201cIt has a certain ick factor to it that lint does not,\u201d she said.\n\nPennington said CLEANR is very focused on the consumer experience and the need \u201cto make it as easy as possible to clean the device.\u201d\n\nThe competition\n\nCLEANR has competition. Korean-owned Samsung has partnered with the Patagonia clothing company to develop a machine that removes microplastics, and there are others addressing the problem. But Moore said CLEANR\u2019s technology is superior to anything he has seen in the marketplace.\n\nAnd CLEANR\u2019s three co-founders have no shortage of desire to succeed. Pennington passed on a full-time job at Proctor & Gamble six months ago to pursue his dream, while Dillman bagged an internship with Nissan in Michigan for the same reason.\n\n\u201cWe all go to the gym every now and then, and then the rest of our time is probably spent here,\u201d said Dillman, seated at a table with his co-founders on the seventh floor of the think [box] that is still the company\u2019s home base.\n\nThe question now is whether their effort will result in a successful undertaking.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of risk involved, said Michael Goldberg, an associate professor in CWRU\u2019s Weatherhead School of Management and executive director of the Veale Institute of Entrepreneurship, but Pennington, Dillman and Miller are smart, dedicated and know how to articulate the problem they are trying to solve.\n\n\u201cI know people who have invested in them and they wouldn\u2019t have done it if it didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said.\n\nMoore, for one, is betting on a good outcome, having put some of his own money in the startup. It\u2019s heartening, he said, to see young people taking on the challenge of making the planet a cleaner place.\n\n\u201cThe good news is I haven\u2019t found anybody who thinks having plastic in your body is good,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly iterations of CLEANR's prototype of a filter to remove microplastics shed from clothing during the wash cycle.Peter Krouse, cleveland.com\n\nPeter Krouse covers the environment for cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer.

The startup further alleged that the more established fintech company has refused its entry into Exiap, a Wise-operated currency transfer rates comparison website. Wise also runs similar sites, Geldtransfer and Currencyshop.\n\nWriting further in the letter, Atlantic Money, which launched in the UK and European Union in 2022, noted that Wise\u2019s action \u201cis harmful to competition across the UK and EU,\u201d adding that the development could shoot up transfer fees charged by money transfer providers.\n\nWatch the recent FMLS22 session on innovating in fintech.\n\nWise Says It Is Not Afraid of Listing Cheaper Competitors\n\nHowever, a Wise spokesperson told Guardian UK that the company delisted Atlantic Money temporarily \u201cfor a number of operational reasons\u201d including queries it received from the startup\u2019s customers. \u201cWe take compliance with all applicable laws very seriously,\u201d the spokeperson said.\n\nAtlantic Money\u2019s website says it charges a flat fee of \u00a33 for money transfer. According to reports, this fee can be cheaper for customers when they want to transfer certain amounts of money. However, Wise in a statement said it is not afraid of listing cheaper alternatives.\n\nWise was established in January 2011 and is one of the UK\u2019s top fintech firms. The company hit a value of almost \u00a39 billion after it debuted on the London Stock Exchange in 2021.

Exiap, Geldtransfer, and Currencyshop are the six external currency conversion and money transfer comparison sites that it owns.\n\nLaunched in the UK and EU last year, Atlantic Money was created by two former Robinhood workers. The London-based company charges a fixed price of \u00a33/\u20ac3 (about $3) for money transfers, and MoneySavingExpert reported that for specific clients transferring more than \u00a3650 ($805), the site might be cheaper.\n\nRead Also: Goldman Sachs Lays Off Marcus Digital Bank Workers Amidst Failed Year for Neobanks\n\nIs Wise Rejecting Atlantic Money?\n\nWise included Atlantic Money in a pricing comparison on Wise.com in October 2022. However, the company's name was taken from the site only last week after receiving questions from clients about its business.\n\nAtlantic was also rejected entrance onto the Exiap and Geldtransfers comparison sites, which Wise controls. The representative said in November 2022 that Atlantic Money is yet in the early phases of building its brand and growing a public footprint.\n\nConcerns have been dismissed by Atlantic, though. The company did not disclose its earnings, although it did report handling \u00a38.8 million ($10 million) in transactions between late July and October of last year.\n\nWise is basically acting as the gatekeeper to the market and establishing a major barrier to entry, Atlantic said to the CMA. The firm argues that this practice increases consumer costs in the UK and the EU.\n\nIf the CMA has reason to be concerned by the complaint, it may open an inquiry into the matter. If the Wise is found responsible, it may be fined or required to take corrective measures.\n\nAs part of routine maintenance to keep the list helpful for the consumers, Wise said that Atlantic was not the first supplier to be removed from the company's pricing comparison listings.\n\nAccording to Wise, the CMA has not been in touch with them. The CMA told The Guardian that it could not provide details about individual instances without first conducting an official inquiry.\n\nRead Also: Fraud Security, Startup Hawk AI, Raises $17 Million to Expand its Products for Banks, Payment Firms, and Fintechs\n\n\u24d2 2022 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Atlantic Money said it has also been removed from Wise-owned price comparison websites such as Exiap, Geldtransfers and Currencyshop.\n\nFounded in 2020, London-based Atlantic Money lets customers send up to \u00a31m abroad, charging a flat fixed fee of \u00a33. The complaint puts Atlantic Money at loggerheads with its much larger competitor Wise, which went public in 2021 in London\u2019s largest-ever tech listing.\n\nNeeraj Baid, co-founder, Atlantic Money, said: \u201cWise\u2019s foundation is built on the promise of trust, transparency and doing the best for the people. It\u2019s disappointing to see now that they become what they have always fought against. We are even more convinced now that we are on the right track.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Wise said: \u201cWe\u2019re really proud to have the comparison tool as part of our website, and we\u2019re not afraid to list cheaper competitors. We\u2019ve done that for years and still do. We decided to remove Atlantic Money for the time being for a number of operational reasons, including queries received from customers about their business. We take compliance with all applicable laws very seriously.\u201d\n\nUKTN asked for more details on the \u201cqueries received from customers\u201d but Wise declined to give further comment.\n\nWise\u2019s website states: \u201cSometimes, we won\u2019t be your cheapest option. Whenever possible, our price comparison tool will let you know that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Atlantic Money, it was \u201coften shown\u201d as the cheapest for \u201ca number of G10 currencies\u201d.\n\nWise recently increased its revenue growth projection for the upcoming financial year. It is no stranger to controversy, with its co-founder and CEO Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann under investigation by the financial regulator for failing to pay a \u00a3720,495 tax bill.\n\nAtlantic Money came out of stealth in March last year before going on to raise \u00a32.5m in the following July.

            "text": "Pat East\n\nGuest columnist\n\nEarlier this month, I summarized The Mill's and our startups' accomplishments for 2022. It\u2019s great to take stock of the big wins and get motivated for the upcoming year. With that, what does our future look like? Here are our top 4 priorities and objectives for 2023:\n\nHire new staff\n\nThe Mill has an extraordinary, hardworking staff, and we need more talented folks to help us fulfill our mission of launching and accelerating startups and our vision of becoming Indiana\u2019s center of gravity for entrepreneurship. We began the year with 12 folks \u2014 eight full-time and four part-time. This year, we plan to hire five folks \u2014 four full-time and one part-time. Some of these include a dedicated venue manager, a dedicated community manager (previously these two roles were combined), and a startup coach.\n\nThis last one is vital for our founders and most directly impacts them. Building a company is hard and can be a lonely journey. Founders need as much advice and support as we can provide. In addition to our existing paid and volunteer mentors, we need a Startup Coach who can work hand-in-hand with our founders and help expose blind spots. Ideally, we\u2019ll find someone who has exited their company. We might also combine several folks who could specialize in single topics like fundraising, go-to market, sales, finance, etc. Founders could \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure.\u201d\n\nHappening in 2023:Five big projects coming in 2023 include library branch, apartments, restaurants\n\nSell additional services\n\nThe Mill generates revenue through a variety of sources: coworking memberships, event rentals, corporate sponsorships, individual donations and grants. We also sell some of our services and want to do more of that this year.\n\nWe sell services like Flywheel Fund; investors pay us a membership fee to participate. Because we run our own startup pitch competitions, we have the knowledge to run them for other cities; we manage the city of Fort Wayne\u2019s pitch competition.\n\nThere\u2019s also an opportunity to sell our pre-accelerator to other organizations, specifically universities. Think of pre-accelerators like a class on how to launch and accelerate a startup. It takes place over a concentrated period of time, usually 6-12 weeks, is led by an instructor who teaches a curriculum, and we introduce founders to mentors and investors, among various activities.\n\nWe experienced great success with three pre-accelerators last year, one of them with Innovation and Commercialization Office at Indiana University. Most universities have a tech transfer office, where folks try to build companies based on intellectual property professors create. Pre-accelerators act as a forcing mechanism to get some faculty and staff off the sidelines and into the tech transfer office when they might not have otherwise.\n\nBuild the Tech Center\n\nThis week, the city of Bloomington and The Mill announced we\u2019ve expanded our public-private partnership. This will expand Bloomington\u2019s innovation economy, attract cutting-edge companies, and create high-paying jobs. The Mill will now manage the development and marketing of the Trades District, a 12-acre portion of the Bloomington Certified Technology Park.\n\nThe first order of business will be to hire an executive to market and develop the Trades District. This hire will also finalize the vision for the Tech Center, a building that will be catty-corner to The Mill. They\u2019ll oversee its construction, recruit tenants, and build collaborations and partnerships with key stakeholders.\n\nConstruction on the Tech Center is expected to begin in the fall of 2023. In 2021, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) awarded the Bloomington Redevelopment Commission (RDC) and the Bloomington Economic Development Corp. a $3.5 million CARES Act Recovery Assistance grant to build the Tech Center. Acting on behalf of the city, the RDC will match the federal investment with a $1.6 million pledge to the project.\n\nFor veterans:Want to save on property taxes? Some veterans can save up to $38,960\n\nExpand programming\n\nWhile we\u2019re always improving and refining our programming, there are a few specific expansions we\u2019ll focus on in 2023.\n\nCode/IT Academy, our code school for the unemployed and underemployed, will expand into Washington and Crawford counties. With our partnership with Ivy Tech, we already run three cohorts annually for Monroe County residents. These focus on CompTIA Security+, Intro to Web Design, and AWS Cloud Practitioner among others.\n\nBloomington Remote moved 24 people to Bloomington last year. These folks generated $1.7 million of economic impact in their first year, which compounds annually, and generates tax revenue for the city. They buy homes (half of our recruits have purchased homes; the average is $457,000 versus the citywide average of $300,000), support small businesses, and contribute to the vibrancy of our city. One of our first recruits, Pablo Fuentes, sits on the board for the Buskirk-Chumley Theater and founded the Cosmic Songwriter's Club, where singer-songwriters perform their original works.\n\nWe\u2019ll also expand Flywheel Fund into Greater Lafayette and South Bend-Elkhart. Since we already invest throughout the state, what does \u201copening chapters\u201d there actually mean? We don\u2019t have investors from those area, so transforming high net worth individuals into startup investors is one objective. We\u2019ll also put our thumb on the scale for local companies, ensuring we source and develop startups to meet our investment criteria. We\u2019ll aim for one-third of the capital to be invested in local startups with the rest throughout Indiana.\n\nI\u2019m excited about our plans for 2023. If you\u2019d like to participate in any of them, please email at pat@dimensionmill.org.\n\nPat East is executive director of The Mill, a nonprofit entrepreneurship center on a mission to launch and accelerate startups, and ultimately to become Indiana\u2019s center of gravity for entrepreneurship.",

Apart from the monetary penalty imposed on the behemoth, CCI had also issued a cease-and-desist order for all the anti-competitive practices which Google was involved in.\n\nThe matter was listed for admission before the NCLAT on the 11th of January this year, wherein the tribunal refused the stay and asked Google to submit 10% of the penalty amount.\n\nThe Supreme Court in today\u2019s order declined the stay.\n\nThe bench also observed that \"Findings by CCI cannot be said to be without jurisdiction or with manifest error\". The findings cannot be regarded as contrary to weight of record at an interlocutory stage.\n\nThe SC has affirmed the order of NCLAT declining interim relief to Google. SC has directed Google to comply with the remedial directions given by the CCI in a week\u2019s time.\n\nThe verdict issued by the Supreme Court is a monumental step towards fair competition and practices in India. It is imperative to send out a strong message that abusing one\u2019s dominant position or resorting to unfair practices will not go unnoticed.\n\nThis decision could potentially embolden the Startup ecosystem in the country, boost innovation, and encourage smaller players to enter the market.\n\nADIF (Alliance of Digital India Foundation), a policy think tank for Indian Startups, welcomes the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict, as it is paramount to promote fair practices in the markets, to ensure an equal playing field and a transparent ecosystem.\n\nADIF spokesperson shared that the recent CCI decision and the SC upholding NCLAT decision of refusing stay has set a global benchmark, and would cement India\u2019s position in preventing Startup\u2019s interests and severely restricting abuse of dominance by Google.\n\nADIF spokesperson further shared that Google should stop making disrespectful allegations towards Indian statutory bodies such as CCI\u2019s Investigative report copy pasting the content and Google should respect the India statutory authorities and law of the land.",

            "text": "As India marked National Startup Day on January 16 this year, the Rajasthan government continued ramping up its efforts to engage with the startup community in the state, with a number of events at Techno Hub, Jaipur and iStart Nest centres in various divisional headquarters.\n\n\n\n\n\nKicking things off in Jaipur, iStart Rajasthan \u2014 the state government\u2019s flagship startup program \u2014 signed an MoU with JITO, Centre of excellence. This was followed by the Rajasthan chapter of TiE hosting their TYE pitching competition at the Bhamashah Techno Hub. The competition saw 410 registrations from 16 schools from across Rajasthan, the highest number across editions held so far. After entrepreneurship masterclasses and focused one-on-one mentoring by TiE mentors, the top 25 pitches were shortlisted who presented their business ideas to a jury. The top three teams \u2014 TAPMI, School Banking Association, and Orenth \u2014 received cash prizes of Rs 10,000 to build a working prototype for their ideas, while 20 other awards were also presented to teams in various categories to motivate them on their startup journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nA fireside chat and interactive discussion on \u2018Startup Ecosystem\u2019 with Mandar Joshi, Executive Chairman, MStrategy Global and Sumit Srivastawa, Founder and CEO, Startup Chaupal was also organised, which saw a number of startup founders and entrepreneurs in attendance.\n\nThe iStart Nest in Bikaner, meanwhile, hosted three knowledge sessions for startups, on \u2018Fundraising techniques\u2019, by Anuj Ahuja, Founder, Studybase Tech Pvt Ltd; on \u2018Company formation\u2019 by Dinesh Sharma, C.A.; and another on \u2018Tech development\u2019 by Mr. Devendra Tiwari, H.O.D., CS Dept., BTU - Bikaner. At iStart Nest in Kota, a Startup Bootcamp was organised, with Luv Agarwal, WFC Venture Partner, BNI Kota Region Director; Vijay Johar, Certified Business Coach, Action COACH USA and Entrepreneur; and Vipul Paliwal - Certified Business Coach, Action COACH USA and Entrepreneur. An investor workshop with Nitin Jain, Chairman, JITO Jodhpur was also held at iStart Nest in Jodhpur.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 40 engineering students attended sessions at the iStart Nest in Bharatpur, along with startups founders, which included a talk on \u2018Company formation\u2019 by iStart mentor Deepesh Vishwakarma and a tour of the incubation centre. At the iStart Nest in Udaipur, attendees also participated in a session on Intellectual Property Rights by Brijesh Chauhan, Facilitator/IT Mitra.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most sessions each venue covered a number of topics to help founders learn about the startup journey \u2014 such as fundraising, tech scaling, and more \u2014 the overarching theme across venues was the introduction and familiarisation of startups, investors, industry leaders, and other stakeholders with the Rajasthan Startup Policy 2022, that was launched at the Rajasthan DigiFest Jodhpur in November last year. The policy aims to promote Rajasthan as a hub for innovation and boost startup growth across industry verticals such as agriculture, education, healthcare, and fintech; increase job opportunities for and upskill youth; and encourage diversity and sustainability within the startup ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rajasthan Investor Conclave was also hosted at Techno Hub in Jaipur on January 16 and 17, 2023, as part of the National Startup Day events. Organised in partnership with Jaipur-based virtual incubator and fundraising platform Startup Chaupal, the conclave is a common platform for startups and investors to network and find opportunities for partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnuj said the response from the startup community for the National Startup Day events at Bikaner was \u2018overwhelming\u2019. \u201cAfter the sessions, a number of entrepreneurs were inspired to register their startups. This is a way we can give back to the ecosystem. There\u2019s definitely a connection with the startups for these kinds of events \u2014 when people see that others can do it, they feel they can do it too. Things are also evolving really fast and when they see companies from their own hometowns growing and scaling, it definitely inspires them. I wish these sessions were there when we were coming out of college as well,\u201d Anuj shared.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuv and Vipul, who led the startup bootcamp session in Kota, added that these events helped show that Rajasthan\u2019s startups helped create real employment in the state, as well as helped people understand the startup ecosystem better. Vipul explained, \u201cA lot of founders think that traditional businesses are different from startups \u2014 but both fields are governed by the same principles. The only differentiator is that startups usually grow faster, and aim for funding to save time before scaling, while businesses are mostly bootstrapped,\u201d while Luv said, \u201cWhen we\u2019re trying to build an ecosystem, it\u2019s important that the general public is also part of them. We as a people are very risk averse in general. But events like these can promote a healthy mindset of startups and the ecosystem, and also give people the idea of investing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the importance of hosting such events for startups, Tapan Kumar, SA Joint Director at Rajasthan\u2019s Department of Information Technology and Communication said, \u201cOur burgeoning startup ecosystem is testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of the people of Rajasthan. While the government engages with startups on a regular basis throughout the year, by having National Startup Day-specific events it helps shine a spotlight on the various career and business options available for the youth of the state, and allows for the growth of an innovation-led ecosystem for sustainable development across industries.\u201d",

            "text": "One of the UK\u2019s fintech darlings, Wise, could face a regulatory investigation after a rival startup accused the money transfer firm of stifling competition.\n\nLondon-headquartered Atlantic Money has written to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to raise concerns over potential conflicts of interest and anti-competitive behaviour after Wise blocked the firm from a swathe of its own price comparison sites.\n\nAn investigation could be a blow for Wise, formerly known as TransferWise, which became the largest tech listing in the UK when it was valued at nearly \u00a39bn after its 2021 stock market debut.\n\nHowever, it would not be the first controversy to hit the company, after it emerged last summer that its co-founder Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority for failing to pay his taxes.\n\nAtlantic\u2019s own complaint relates to Wise\u2019s price comparison sites, which Atlantic says appear to be independent.\n\nWise runs a price comparison page on its own website that lists the transfer fees and exchange rates of rivals, including major high street banks, as well as Western Union, Starling Bank and MoneyGram. It also owns least six external currency conversion and money transfer comparison sites including Exiap, Geldtransfer and Currencyshop.\n\nAtlantic Money, which was founded by two former employees of US trading platform Robinhood, launched in the UK and EU last year. The London-headquartered startup charges a \u00a33/\u20ac3 flat fee for money transfers, with MoneySavingExpert.com saying that the platform can be cheaper for some customers who are sending more than \u00a3650.\n\nWise originally listed Atlantic Money on its Wise.com price comparisons page in October 2022, but removed the firm last week. Wise told the Guardian that it \u201cdecided to remove Atlantic Money for the time being for a number of operational reasons, including queries received from customers about their business. We take compliance with all applicable laws very seriously.\u201d\n\nAtlantic was also refused entry on to the Exiap and Geldtransfers comparison sites, which Wise owns, with the representative claiming in November: \u201cAtlantic Money is still in the early stages of establishing its brand and building a public footprint.\u201d\n\nAtlantic has rebuffed concerns over its business. The firm has not yet revealed its own profits, but said it processed transactions worth \u20ac10m (\u00a38.8m) between late July and October last year.\n\nIt also noted that Exiap\u2019s website states it does \u201cnot investigate the solvency of companies we mention\u201d and \u201cthere is always a risk that a company can struggle and go bust\u201d.\n\n\u201cWise is effectively acting as gatekeeper to the market and creating a substantial barrier to entry for cheaper and more innovative providers to establish themselves,\u201d Atlantic said in its letter to the CMA. \u201cThis conduct is harmful to competition across the UK and EU and, we would submit, ultimately results in higher fees for end consumers.\u201d\n\nIf the complaint were to raise concerns for the CMA, the regulator could launch an investigation and eventually impose a fine or order action by the offending firm if they are found guilty of wrongdoing.\n\nWise said Atlantic was not the first provider to be removed from its price comparison lists, but said this was part of regular reviews meant \u201cto keep the list useful for our customers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud to have the comparison tool as part of our website, and we\u2019re not afraid to list cheaper competitors\u201d, a spokesperson for Wise said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done that for years and still do.\u201d\n\nWise said it had not been contacted by the CMA. The CMA said it was unable to comment on specific cases outside a formal investigation.",

Now, a number of Indian startups have accused Google of using \u201cdelaying tactics\u201d, saying its changes to Android are merely cosmetic.\u25a0 Companies oppose certain proposals in Delhi govt's draft aggregator policy\u25a0 Amid global layoffs, techies are looking for safer options than startups\u25a0 PIB fact-check plan on hold for more talks Indian internet startups have termed the recent changes made by Google to its Android operating system and Play Store Billing policies as \u201c delaying tactics\u201d that are \u201ccosmetic in nature\u201d as the search giant continues its appeal against the October order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI).Google is following the same playbook that it employed in Europe and South Korea and is exploiting loopholes to show compliance with the orders that were to come into effect on January 26, developers told us. This was after the Supreme extended the January 19 deadline by a week.On Wednesday, Google announced around five changes to the way it operates Android and Google Play billing in India. India\u2019s competition watchdog in its two rulings \u2013 one on October 20 and the second on October 25 \u2013 that directed the American company to make close to 20 changes to its services in India.\u201cHow can Google defy both CCI and Supreme Court,\u201d asked Rohan Verma, CEO of MapMyIndia, a listed entity that competes with Google Maps.Pointing out that Google has listed out just a few points instead of following all 10 directives by CCI he said, \u201cDespite CCI\u2019s directive, why is Google not allowing users to uninstall Google Maps and other apps and why is Google not allowing other app stores to be distributed through Google Play Store? \u201d he said.Snehil Khanor, cofounder & CEO of TrulyMadly.com, said Google\u2019s implementation of user choice billing was in direct violation of the CCI order as it will still force developers to use its gateway to integrate with other payment gateways. It will also continue to charge 26% instead of 30% of the transaction value.A group of tech companies has flagged certain proposals envisaged in the Delhi government's draft aggregator policy floated last July, which seeks to convert cabs and delivery fleets in the national capital to electric vehicles in a phased manner.Industry body IndiaTech, which represents companies such as Ola, Zomato and Zepto, has argued in its representation to the Delhi government that the implementation of the policy could create a burden on delivery executives and cab drivers who own or rent vehicles.For two-wheeler delivery fleets, the Delhi government has proposed 10% EVs in the fleet within six months of the notification, leading up to 100% EV fleet by April 1, 2030. For cab aggregators, 5% of their four-wheeler fleet will have to be EVs within six months of notification. The policy is yet to be notified by the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi.Alongside proposing the shift to electric vehicles, the draft policy says aggregators could be penalised with a fine of Rs 50,000 per vehicle for operating or managing conventional vehicles in Delhi.In its submission to the Delhi government last week, IndiaTech has also said that provisions of the draft policy could impact 11 million gig workers in the Delhi-National Capital Region, and \u201clead to a trade-off between two sustainability verticals \u2014 livelihood and environment\u201dWith almost all big technology companies announcing global layoffs one after the other, professionals in the sector in India are frantically looking for more secure options. The inflow of resumes from tech industry employees who have not received pink slips has at least doubled in the past month or so, said executives at recruitment services providers and executive search firms. They included employees from companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, which all have announced global layoffs.Fearing more layoffs, employees in the tech industry are looking for more stable jobs that often strictly exclude startups, said recruitment experts at firms including Transearch, ABC Consultants, Adecco, Careernet and CIEL HR Services. Careernet, a staffing and recruitment firm in Bengaluru, got as many as 50 CVs last week from tech sector employees looking for a job change, compared with around five per week about a month ago.The government has deferred notifying a contentious proposal under the IT Rules , which required intermediaries to take down content declared fake by the fact-check unit of the Press Information Bureau (PIB) or any other competent authority, officials told ET.A fresh round of consultations on the proposed rules is likely to take place in February, a government official said.Last week, the government introduced this clause along with a set of proposed changes to the IT Rules that were aimed at regulating the online gaming industry.A late-night update to the draft of the rules last week included the fact checking clause, and extended the deadline for stakeholder comments to January 25.The government plans to release the final notification with respect to online gaming companies by January 31, the officials said. But the fact check clause will not be a part of this notification, sources added.Several public policy experts have said that the draft rules could give the government more influence on content shared on social media platforms. The Editors Guild of India (EGI) raised concerns in an open letter to the Ministry of Electronics and IT, saying the proposed rule could lead to government censorship.IT services spending is veering towards more cost optimisation-type deals , spurred by the uncertain global economic scenario. Industry experts said the top players like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCLTech, Infosys, and Wipro will be better positioned to tap this opportunity, as quite a few such deals fall under traditional outsourcing requirements.The focus on cost is because the business environment globally is facing challenges such as high inflation, economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions in specific pockets like Europe. The after-effects of this have been seen in layoffs at Big Tech firms such as Meta, Microsoft and Google.TCS said during its third quarter results that demand for strategic, long-term, cost-based restructuring deals in markets like the UK is on the rise, whereas both cost optimisation and transformation deals are being seen in the United States.ChatGPT is coming for classrooms.
