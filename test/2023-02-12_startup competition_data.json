            "text": "Epic Games, the creator of popular online shooter game Fortnite, has filed a complaint with the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) stating that Google is continuing to violate the remedial measures issued by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in the Android case.\n\nEpic Games is one of the biggest video games and software development companies in the world and is already engaged in a legal dispute against Google in US courts, accusing them of anti-competitive practices. It has also filed lawsuits against the search giant in Australia and the UK.\n\nIn its petition to the NCLAT, Epic Games requested impleadment as a party-respondent in Google\u2019s appeal of the CCI\u2019s ruling in the Android dispute. According to the application, Epic Games requested NCLAT to order Google to end its contempt of the CCI\u2019s Remedial Directions so that it can host and allow download of rival app stores through the Google Play Store.\n\nDespite the deadline to comply having passed, Epic Games claims that users in India are still unable to remove Google Play Store apps that have been pre-installed on their Android devices and are also restricted from sideloading apps from other sources.\n\nEpic Games also argued that Google\u2019s monopoly over the distribution of apps for Android devices, along with the company\u2019s 30% share of app sales and in-app purchases, results in an unfair market that discourages innovation and competition.\n\nA startup body, Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), had also filed a caveat in NCLAT on Google CCI orders in November last year. According to CCI rulings, Google misused its dominant position while negotiating Android agreements with smartphone manufacturers and Play Store terms with developers.\n\nAdditionally, the CCI fined Google Rs. 1,337.76 crore for allegedly abusing its authoritative position in the Android mobile ecosystem last year.\n\nThe CCI also determined that requiring the full pre-installation of Google Mobile Suite (GMS) under the mobile application and distribution agreement (MADA), with no way to remove it, amounted to imposing unfair restrictions on device manufacturers.",

            "text": "The is likely to appoint experts from the technology and startup ecosystem to the recently formed committee on digital competition law, a senior official told Business Standard. The 16-member panel currently has government officials and senior lawyers, many of whom represent big tech firms.\n\nAn official memorandum detailing the composition of the panel said that the chairperson of the committee-- the MCA secretary--can \u201cco-opt any other person as a member or special invitee as and when required.\u201d\n\nStartups, meanwhile, have been concerned about non-representation on the government panel, which many said was skewed in favour of the big tech firms.\n\n\u201cThe government is very vocal about putting controls on the practices of big techs. But forming a committee of a few lawyers who actually represent these companies can muddle up with the whole purpose of the bill. The government must be inclusive while composing the committee, as these deliberations need the voice from the small players of the ecosystem (as well),\u201d an industry executive said.\n\nClarifying the government's position, however, a senior official said at the time of forming the committee, it wasn't clear who would represent the technology world and that option therefore was kept open. \u201cThe government will listen to all parties. There will be more people on this panel from various sectors, but they are yet to be named,\u201d the official added.\n\nA leading think tank for the Indian startup ecosystem said it will write to the ministry on the inclusion of small players in the consultation process.\n\nWhile startup companies themselves are not likely to be part of the panel, those with understanding of the sector and its challenges would be invited by the MCA to take part in the discussions.\n\nA parliamentary committee\u2019s report had underlined the need for ex-ante regulations for the big tech. They are cautionary and based on anticipated changes or activity. The house panel said the government must frame a definition for Systemically Important Digital Intermediaries (SIDIs) that need tighter regulations. The classification could be based on revenues, market capitalisation, and the number of active users.\n\nExperts agree that the digital space has, for much of the last decade, not been exactly a level playing field, with a few players having a hold over most of the internet traffic. \u201cMany variables come into play while ascertaining dominance in digital markets - targeted advertisements, gateway platforms, and spheres of analytics. A specialised mechanism to ascertain anti-competitive practices in the digital space looks like a good move,\u201d said Siddharth Mody, Senior Partner, Desai & Diwanji.\n\nAmong those named as part of the committee are its chairperson (MCA secretary Manoj Govil), Sangeeta Verma, acting chairperson, Competition Commission of India, and Saurabh Srivastava, chairman, Indian Angel Network and co-founder of industry body Nasscom.\n\nLegal representatives on the panel include Haigreve Khaitan of Khaitan & Co, Pallavi Shardul Shroff of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, Anand Pathak, P&A Law Offices, and Rahul Rai, Axiom5 Law Chamber.\n\nInvitees from NITI Aayog, the departments of commerce, economic affairs and consumer affairs, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), and Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) will also be a part of the new committee.",

            "text": "Hailing from a humble background in small-town Alabama, Dr. Chris Funderburk has blazed a trail in the competitive world of plastic surgery, earning a reputation as the go-to plastic surgeon for men in New York City. As a member of the Neinstein Plastic Surgery team, he serves a growing base of younger male patients who seek his expertise in aesthetic enhancements, especially minimally invasive bodywork.\n\nFrom a young age, Dr. Funderburk was no stranger to hard work. Growing up in a mill town with parents who held multiple jobs to make ends meet, he learned the value of a strong work ethic. He did everything from running cash registers and stocking shelves at his grandfather\u2019s store to working on his uncle\u2019s landscaping team.\n\nAfter earning his Master\u2019s Degree from the University of Alabama, Dr. Funderburk initially pursued a career in research. However, he quickly realized that his passion for human connection was not being fulfilled and pivoted to the medical field.\n\nFinding a New Path\n\nDuring his medical training, he had the opportunity to complete several plastic surgery rotations, including one at New York University. It was during this time, in 2008, that he found himself drawn to the field of plastic surgery.\n\nAlong with this professional turning point, Dr. Funderburk\u2019s personal life was undergoing significant changes. The birth of his son led him to explore a new chapter in his life. This period of transition proved to be life-changing in more ways than one, as Dr. Funderburk came out and embraced his true identity.\n\nA Year of Professional and Personal Milestones\n\nAfter the birth of his son, he completed his general surgery residency at Emory University in Atlanta. This was followed by a move to Dartmouth for a plastic surgery residency, where he sharpened his focus on the field.\n\nHis ambition soon led him to New York City, where he was selected for a highly competitive fellowship at Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital. It was here that he discovered his passion for minimally invasive bodywork, something that has become his area of specialization. It was also in New York that he started working alongside Dr. Ryan Neinstein.\n\nLearning from the Best\n\nDr. Neinstein comments, \u201cNot everyone enjoys the process of training. But, Chris was just like a sponge\u2014whatever advice I gave him, he absorbed and took on board. And the results speak for themselves. Chris has risen to be a leading specialist, with the kind of trajectory that is only possible thanks to his rigorous approach to learning and self-development.\u201d\n\nDr. Funderburk found himself drawn to a younger generation of patients who sought subtle, natural-looking results from their procedures. \u201cThese health-conscious and active individuals,\u201d he explains, \u201cmay have had a few stubborn areas of fat that wouldn\u2019t go away, despite their best efforts. I helped them achieve their desired results with minimal downtime and without anyone knowing.\u201d\n\nA Surprising Surgical Niche\n\nNeinstein Plastic Surgery had a surprising 30% male patient base, a rarity in the field. Dr. Neinstein recognized Dr. Funderburk\u2019s interest in male plastic surgery and saw an opportunity to market him as a \u2018male specialist\u2019.\n\nTogether, they expanded the practice, offering procedures, including abs and torso shaping, body contouring, male butt lifts and all natural enhancements without implants. Male patients who once avoided being seen entering the clinic, requesting off-hours appointments, became bolder. The stigma diminished to the point where male patients in their 20s and 30s frequented the clinic without hesitation.\n\nThe Start of a New Male Trend\n\nCommenting on the growing trend, Dr. Funderburk added, \u201cBotox is a common starting point for many younger males to treat lines between the eyebrows and forehead. Injectables are then used to build up weak jaws and chins. Likewise, liposuction is also a popular choice for a lean and athletic torso.\u201d\n\nBut, when asked about his favorite procedure, Dr. Funderburk had no hesitation, \u201cI have a special fondness for male body contouring. It is so satisfying to take out stubborn fat for patients who have been trying everything at the gym but not getting the results they want. I get to see their excitement as we make a dramatic difference in their appearance.\u201d",

In this market, the conventional wisdom for investors would be to slow down and hold off from deploying capital.\n\nBut in my opinion, that wisdom is anything but wise. As an early-stage angel investor with family office experience, I know that the best opportunities are available now. My colleagues and I have been investing in as many deals as possible, often at incredible discounts; the first-mover advantages present in early 2023 are unlike anything seen in recent memory.\n\nGiven this unprecedented opportunity, it\u2019s mind-boggling to me that so many early-stage seasoned investors (who are meant to be anti-cyclical and bullish) are buying into the narrative being pushed by the media of the current market. The media certainly plays a role, with endless headlines about economic downturn. Seasoned experts such as Warren Buffett have written and spoken of market opportunities such as the cycle we are in \u2013 the time to act is now.\n\nFinance meme brands like Litquidity, have done a great job of educating the general public on investing and pushed the \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d mentality for the last several years, only for their followers (in large part accredited investors, including VC\u2019s) to sit idly by when the moment to actually buy low is now upon us.\n\nAdmittedly, the current market may not yield the immediate rewards that some investors yearn for in our age of instant gratification. It\u2019s unlikely that deals forged today will yield mammoth returns in the next six months, or even two to three years. But investors that have patience \u2014 patience often gained from the family office or private equity ecosystems \u2013 stand to benefit tremendously. Returns over the next five to ten years will be enormous, thanks to the low prices available in 2023.\n\nDespite the sizable upside available from 2023 investments, a record number of early-stage funds are delaying their capital deployments, preferring to wait until the market \u201cshakes out.\u201d I spoke with several early-stage investors who declined to comment for this article because they are spooked by headlines and waiting until later to invest. However, there are notable exceptions.\n\nJesse Draper, General Partner of Halogen Ventures, stated that:\n\n\u201cThe market headlines are trying to lead us with fear. Some of the largest businesses in the world came out of the last recession. Today, the best place to invest your money is in the cracks shown by the COVID pandemic. Childcare is broken. Healthcare is a disaster all around. And education is unaffordable. There are so many great opportunities to invest in right now, and they will be the billion dollar and even trillion dollar exits of the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Lee Moser \u2013 Managing Partner at AnD Ventures, has:\n\n\u201cAn optimistic view on 2023 because there is still a lot of dry powder yet to be allocated for funds, both in Israel and internationally. We will definitely not be on the fence in Q1, not waiting to see the direction the market is heading in; instead, we believe that the biggest time for innovation is during a time of distress and crisis. Therefore, we are definitely looking to invest.\u201d\n\nLP and advisor Tami Holzman agrees:\n\n\u201cI believe that investing in transformational early-stage companies during an economic downturn is an intelligent and opportunistic strategy. Valuations are attractive, and top talent becomes available.Innovation and grit drives success.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all of the investors willing to be quoted, those bullish on deploying capital this quarter, were women. And don\u2019t forget that female fund managers outperform men.\n\nEarly stage investors, remember: Your role is to be anti-cyclical and anti-conventional. Your LPs, and the startup ecosystem more broadly, rely on you to find unicorns \u2013 especially when the market is tough. The world needs new ideas now more than ever, from healthcare to parental support to biotech, fintech, and countless other verticals.\n\nYou have tremendous power to shape our world, and with that power comes great responsibility: to remain clear-eyed in the face of scare-tactics, to maintain a long-term perspective, and ultimately to enable the next generation of innovation.",

The 200-metre Riviera Tower is just one highlight of The Ellinikon, one of the largest, most ambitious urban regeneration projects in the world. A 6.2 million sq.m, sustainable, master-planned smart city on the grounds of Athens' old international airport, the project is setting a new global standard for resilient urban design, smart living and ESG-aligned investment growth opportunities, nearly doubling the amount of green space in the Athens Metropolitan Area and bringing significant economic development. A true 15-minute city built from the ground up, The Ellinikon will deliver residential, commercial, leisure, retail, dining, entertainment, education, and athletics offerings making this Europe's most innovative and exciting destination for locals and international visitors alike. Designed by Foster + Partners, the Riviera Tower will feature a collection of one-to-five-bedroom residences and penthouses, offering residents spectacular views as well as easy access to the beach and the 310-berth marina. \"We are at a moment in history when sustainable development and investment need to be bold to meet the need for change in how we conceive of urban experiences,\" said Odisseas Athanasiou, CEO of Lamda Development. \"The Ellinikon will have a transformative effect on both Greece and the world, providing a new benchmark for smart, inspiring indoor and outdoor spaces that excite people, while also significantly advancing sustainability in the places we live, work, and enjoy ourselves for the long term. Despite global economic challenges, we are on track with timings and look forward to completing the first phase in 2026\". This project brings several firsts to Greece, including: * The Ellinikon Park, the largest coastal park in Europe, consisting of 2 million sq.m of green space with over 1 million new trees and plants, all native to the local area. * The Riviera Tower, Greece's first residential skyscraper and tallest building, which will offer breathtaking views of the park and sea, combining green sustainability with outstanding style as it is pre-certified with LEED v4 BD +C at a Gold Level. * The Riviera Galleria, a premium destination in Athens with international couture houses, flagship designer stores and must-have emerging brands as well as fine dining, set against the majestic waterfront view of the Athenian Riviera. LEED Precertification at a GOLD level has been successfully completed for the Riviera Galleria * A 185,000 sq.m Commercial Hub, the largest and most contemporary commercial complex in Greece, offering a new philosophy in shopping, working & entertainment and the first mall in Greece to achieve LEED Gold Certification. * A 310-berth marina, Greece's first exclusive marina to offer large-scale mooring capacity for mega-yachts situated within the upgraded 3.5 km long coastal front * Resilient environmentally sustainable design, featuring a net zero carbon footprint economy via the use of cutting-edge energy conservation strategies and emission-reducing systems. The Ellinikon will be self-sufficient in irrigation and electricity needs. * Unique smart features such as electronic vehicle infrastructure, AR navigation, IoT in residential and commercial spaces, and smart water-level sensors for coastal resilience. Alongside the project's steady construction progress with phase 1 completion expected in 2026, The Ellinikon is being met with significant investor, consumer, and public interest. The first part of the Ellinikon Park that was delivered to the public, The Experience Park, has exceeded one million visits in less than a year. Additionally, The Ellinikon Experience Centre \u2013 a unique, impressive visitor centre that allows a glimpse into the future city of the Ellinikon \u2013 has become an Athens destination. The Ellinikon has partnered with some of the world's leading creative minds, including Foster + Partners, Kengo Kuma & Associates, Aedas and Sasaki architects among others for the design, while world-renowned brands have signed agreements and MOUs to be part of it. Impressively, the project is expected to generate \u20ac14 billion in incremental state revenues, 85,000 jobs, and represents approximately 2.4 percent of Greece's GDP. The two major retail districts at The Ellinikon will combine recognized global brands with high-performing local names which lend a uniquely Greek character to the experience as vital parts of the new ecosystem. The Kengo Kuma-designed Riviera Galleria will offer a true lifestyle experience surrounded by sophisticated architecture. The Commercial Hub will consist of the largest mall in Greece, a next generation retail park with stores as well as state-of-the-art office spaces at a next generation \"hybrid mall\". Preliminary agreements have already been agreed for 50% of leasable space. This percentage is expected to increase to 65% within 2023. For Riviera Galleria 20% of leasable space has already been agreed, expected to reach 50% at the end of 2023. Also in high demand are The Ellinikon's residential products, which are unlike anything else in Greece and range from green, tech-powered high-rise luxury units to bespoke seaside villas and trendy, modern parkside residences set alongside lush greenery. Interest has been unprecedented in Greece since it launched locally, with first residential products brought to market already selling out, totaling a \u20ac1.1 billion buyer commitment. Lamda Development plans to bring further residential offerings to the international market soon. Other development highlights include The Mixed Use Tower within the Commercial Hub, which will become Athens' new prestigious business address and Greece's tallest commercial building, and the casino resort, a 5-star luxury hotel with world class gaming floor plus meeting and convention spaces. The other two hotels include The Marina Hotel, offering lifestyle luxury to visitors who arrive by yacht \u2014 or those who are escaping the city for a cosmopolitan stay and The Beach Hotel which will bring together tranquil luxury and seclusion and the year-round dynamics of urban Athens. This enthusiasm around the project is also reflected in the development's overfunding for the first five years\u2014and an inspiring part of that funding has been through Lamda Development's \u20ac230 million green bond, which was open to the public and received investments from organizations such as the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. The proceeds of this green bond will fuel sustainability elements such as developing low-carbon buildings, green infrastructures, and greenspace, all of which will work to achieve The Ellinikon's goals of carbon neutrality and self-sufficiency for irrigation and electricity needs. Poised to become a global model for economic development and sustainable design, The Ellinikon will usher in a new era of smart city living and contribute to the global need for ground-up, environmentally conscious development and a commitment to creating accessible, inclusive, and green spaces.

Russia is believed to have invaded Ukraine to gain unbroken reserves of lithium!In 2021, much smaller deposits of lithium were found in the southern state of Karnataka.Lithium is a rare element crucial for manufacturing electric vehicles. It is a key component in rechargeable batteries that power numerous gadgets like smartphones and laptops, besides just electric vehicles.With a total of 8 million tons, Chile has the largest known reserves of lithium in the world. This puts it ahead of other countries with significant reserves, such as Australia (2.7 million tons), Argentina (2 million tons), and China (1 million tons)., a Mumbai-based startup which provides lead-acid and lithium-ion technology batteries for E-Bike, E-Rickshaws, and Golf Carts, said, \".\"Currently, India is depended on Australia and Argentina for lithium imports.Bolivia has by far the world\u2019s largest lithium reserves however most of it remains in the ground as the country does not have the developed infrastructure to excavate it. Due to this, Bolivia does not rank anywhere near the top in actual lithium production.India imports many important metals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt. With the new discovery of lithium reserves in Jammu and Kashmir, battery and EV manufacturers will not have to depend on imports. Local lithium reserves will help reduce the price of batteries in India, which will further reduce the price of EVs.One ton of lithium is priced at INR 57.36 lakhs. India has got 59 lakh tonnes of lithium Reserves. That is, its value today will be Rs 33,84,31,021 lakh rupees (3,384 billion ) This price is at current market rate.
