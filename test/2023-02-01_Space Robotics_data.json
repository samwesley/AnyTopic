            "text": "It was just the beginning of 2023, when Elon Musk\u2019s re-usable rocket maker and satellite internet company SpaceX was in news to raise $750 million in a new round of funding that values the company at $137 billion.\n\nNow its German rival, The Exploration Company, is making waves for designing the first European space capsule that will use green propellants and open source its operating system. The European space tech company has now raised \u20ac40.5 million in Series A funding led by Europe\u2019s leading early-stage investors EQT Ventures and Red River West. Further, new and existing investors participated, including Promus Ventures, Cherry Ventures, Vsquared, Omnes Capital, July Fund, Partech, Possible Ventures, Habert Dassault Finance, Schlumberger and Sista Fund.\n\nAs a result of this investment, The Exploration Company will build a sustainable, reusable space capsule that can be used by private and public operators to fly cargo into space, resupply space stations, and transport humans at a later time.\n\nMaiden flights in 2024 and 2026\n\nThe startup has built its first re-entry demonstrator in 9 months, and is currently developing its second demonstrator that will fly into space and re-enter the atmosphere in a controlled manner, safely bringing back to Earth cargo payloads from clients \u2013 including several space agencies in Europe. There are plans for maiden flights to take place in 2024 and 2026, according to the company\u2019s press release.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Huby, Co-Founder and CEO explained: \u201cWithin this decade, we will see humanity expand into space and building space stations, sometimes in partnership with the private sector, around the Earth and the Moon, paving the way for humans\u2019 sustainable settlement on the Moon and beyond.\u201d\n\nRed River West Founding Partner, Alfred, Vericel said: \u201cThe mission of Red River West is to invest in European entrepreneurs who build global and impactful companies which we scale together in the US. We are proud to contribute to The Exploration Company\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nEQT Ventures Partner, Ted Persson, said: \u201cH\u00e9l\u00e8ne and the team have brought together a unique mix of world-class industry veterans and young space and software engineers to capitalise on a huge market opportunity and will ultimately enable Europe \u2013 and others \u2013 to participate in the discovery of the new space worlds, in a sustainable and cooperative manner.\u201d\n\nDemocratise space exploration\n\nDuring 2022, funding for space startups halved to $21.9 billion, the lowest level since the 2008 economic crisis. However, there is great potential for Europe\u2019s commercial space industry: estimates state the market will reach $40 billion by 2035 and $70 billion with human spaceflight. As of yet, there is no European solution for transporting people and goods to the space stations around the Earth and the Moon.\n\nFounded in July 2021 by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Huby in Munich, The Exploration Company has a team of aerospace engineers who have worked on some of the biggest space programs such as Orion-ESM, Ariane, etc. By providing Europe with the capacity to explore new space worlds, the company creates a sustainable, affordable and alternative global player, and has already signed several European space agencies as clients.\n\nIn addition, Munich-based space technology will commercialise its maiden capsule, Nyx Mission Odyssey, which will fly goods to space stations and return to Earth. Also, it will finalize and fly its second demonstration capsule, Nyx Mission Possible, which will perform a controlled re-entry into the atmosphere.\n\nBesides Nyx, The Exploration Company is also developing open interface software and hardware available in a SpaceStore, enabling customers to build on these open interfaces, and develop the platform that suits their needs.\n\nEventually, Nyx will carry humans and goods into space to service space stations and conduct long-range exploration. Moreover, the vehicle can be refueled in orbit, extending its potential mission duration. Moreover, it can be launched by a variety of rockets, making it launcher agnostic.",

The students had one week to conduct research and used a Lego robot kit.\n\nJasper High School sophomore, Caden Bootie said he and his teammates created a greenhouse containing moss that serves as a source for planting and growing.\n\n\u201cThis robot will take the oxygen tanks from point A to point B and to demonstrate, we\u2019re going to use an astronaut for the event,\u201d said Bootie.\n\nNASA retiree, Dorothy Rasco worked on 44 space shuttle missions at the Johnson Space Center. Rasco served as a mentor for the competition. She said she knew the Columbia crew well and seeing the next generation take on these projects was a sight to see.\n\n\u201cBeing here with this robotic competition and seeing the different high schools that are here, talking to the different students is really awesome,\u201d Rasco said.\n\nDiboll High School took first place and Hemphill High School came in second. Their robots are to be placed on display at the museum.\n\nCopyright 2023 KTRE. All rights reserved.",

The former NASA astronauts launched on the debut flight of SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in May 2020.\n\nHurley, the spacecraft commander, and Behnken, its pilot, will receive the medal for \"bravery\" exhibited during the Demo-2 mission to the International Space Station. Their debut mission was a complete success, and since this pioneering flight, NASA has flown five operational missions on board Crew Dragon, along with two private spaceflights.\n\nAn operational Crew Dragon has provided NASA with its sole means of reaching the space station aside from the Russian Soyuz vehicle\u2014saving the space agency from the embarrassment of relying on Russia for this transport amid escalating tensions surrounding the war in Ukraine.\n\nOutside of space circles, the space medal is not a particularly well-known honor, especially because it has not been awarded in nearly two decades. However, the medal is prestigious and often only given to astronauts who have died during spaceflight activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of more than four decades, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor has only been awarded to 28 astronauts, ever. Of those, 17 were given posthumously to the crews of the Apollo 1, Challenger, and Columbia accidents.\n\nThe US Congress authorized the president to award the medal \"to any astronaut who in the performance of his duties has distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious efforts and contributions to the welfare of the Nation and of mankind.\"\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter bestowed the first awards on Apollo astronauts Neil Armstrong, Frank Borman, Pete Conrad; Gemini's Gus Grissom; and Mercury's Alan Shepard and John Glenn in 1978. When not awarded posthumously, the award has gone to pioneers, such as Shannon Lucid, who conducted a long-duration spaceflight on the Mir space station, or astronauts who have flown first on new vehicles, such as John Young and Robert Crippen on the space shuttle.\n\nWithin the next two years, additional astronauts will pioneer new spacecraft and may become eligible for the medal.\n\nLater this spring, as soon as April, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will make the debut crewed launch on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the space station. Then, perhaps in late 2024 or early 2025, four astronauts will fly on board NASA's Orion spacecraft around the Moon. These four crew members for the Artemis II mission, expected to include a Canadian astronaut, are likely to be named sometime this spring.",

            "text": "Listen to this article\n\nBoston Dynamics is officially putting its Stretch robot into the hand of its customers. Its first commercial application is with DHL Supply Chain, a company that Boston Dynamics has been collaborating with since 2018, when it began developing Stretch.\n\nDHL Supply Chain was Boston Dynamics\u2019 first Stretch customer back in January 2022, when the company announced a $15 million deal with Boston Dynamics, and now a year later, we have a look at those robots being put to work in DHL warehouses.\n\nIn a video released by Boston Dynamics this morning, we see Stretch using its suction gripper to unload boxes from a shipping container and onto a flexible or telescopic conveyor belt that brings the packages to DHL employees for processing.\n\nOnce Stretch is set to start unloading, it does the work on its own without any interruption needed from DHL staff. Even when Stretch drops a package, it readjusts its methods and picks it back up again.\n\nWith a six and a half foot extended reach and 10-foot vertical reach, Stretch is able to grab packages from all different corners of shipping containers without needing any information about how the container was loaded, or prior knowledge about the individual packages themselves.\n\nStretch is the next generation of Handle, a robot Boston Dynamics introduced in 2017 that combined wheels and legs. While Stretch isn\u2019t equipped with legs, it does have an omnidirectional mobile base with four independently controlled wheels. This means the robot can be moved into any space a pallet can fit into.\n\nStretch comes with an 8-hour battery life, but there will be a 16-hour battery option and the ability to plug Stretch in for continuous power. Stretch uses the Pick vision system, which Boston Dynamics acquired when it bought Kinema Systems in April 2019. Pick uses high-resolution 2D and 3D vision and machine learning algorithms for robotic depalletizing. One of the main keys to success will be Stretch\u2019s ability to handle a variety of boxes.\n\nWhile this is Stretch\u2019s first commercial deployment, DHL plans to gradually scale Stretch for more tasks across multiple facilities over the next few years. DHL is also hoping to integrate Stretch into its warehouse management system so the robot knows where to go and what to pick.\n\nDHL isn\u2019t the only company interested in using the Stretch robot. NFI, a third-party logistics provider (3PL), announced in August 2022 it would be spending $10 million to deploy the robot across its U.S. warehousing operations. Initially, Stretch will unload trucks and containers as a pilot program at NFI\u2019s Savannah, GA facility in 2023. Additional deployments will take place over the next few years.\n\nMarc Raibert, founder and Chairman at Boston Dynamics, will be keynoting the Robotics Summit & Expo, to be held May 10-11, 2023 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. Raibert\u2019s fireside chat \u201cThe Next Decade in Robotics\u201d will close the show and hit on some of the biggest technical hurdles still facing the industry. He will also discuss opportunities for the industry going forward, and what his new AI Institute is working on.\n\nKevin Blankespoor, VP and GM of warehouse robotics at Boston Dynamics, joined The Robot Report Podcast when the company unveiled Stretch in March 2021. On the podcast, Blankespoor described the evolution of the product design, the many system integration challenges, plans to improve the Pick vision system going forward, similarities between Atlas, Spot and Stretch, and much more.

            "text": "When it comes to the evolution of mobile robots, it may be a long time before legged robots are able to safely interact in the real world, according to a new study.\n\nLed by a team of researchers at The Ohio State University, the study published recently in the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022 describes a framework for testing and characterizing the safety of legged robots, machines that, unlike their wheeled counterparts, rely on mechanical limbs for movement. The study found that many current legged robotic models don't always act predictably in response to real-life situations, meaning it's hard to predict whether they'll fail -- or succeed -- at any given task that requires movement.\n\n\"Our work reveals that these robotic systems are complex and, more importantly, anti-intuitive,\" said Bowen Weng, a PhD student in electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State. \"It means you can't rely on the robot's ability to know how to react in certain situations, so the completeness of the testing becomes even more important.\"\n\nAs mobile robots evolve to carry out more diverse and sophisticated tasks, many in the scientific community also note that the industry needs a set of universal safety testing regulations, especially as robots and other artificial intelligence have gradually begun to flow into our everyday lives. Legged robots especially, which are often made of metal and can run as fast as 20 mph, could quickly become safety hazards when expected to operate alongside humans in real and often unpredictable environments, said Weng.\n\n\"Testing is really about assessing risk, and our aim is to investigate how much risk robotics currently presents to users or customers while in a working condition,\" he said.\n\nWhile there are currently some safety specifications in place for the deployment of legged robots, Weng noted that there isn't yet any common agreement on how to test them in the field.\n\nThis study develops the first data-driven, scenario-based safety testing framework of its kind for legged robots, said Weng.\n\n\"In the future, these robots might have the chance to live with human beings side-by-side, and will most likely be collaboratively produced by multiple international parties,\" he said. \"So having safety and testing regulations in place is extremely important for the success of this kind of product.\"\n\nThe research, which was partly inspired by Weng's work as a vehicle safety researcher at the Transportation Research Center, which partners with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, takes advantage of sample-based machine learning algorithms to discern how simulated robots would fail during real-world testing.\n\nThough various factors can be used to characterize a robot's overall safety performance, this study analyzed a set of conditions under which the robot would not fall over while actively navigating a new environment. And because many of the algorithms the team used stemmed from previous robotics experiments, they were able to design multiple scenarios for the simulations to run.\n\nOne trial focused on studying the robot's ability to move while performing tasks at different gaits, such as walking backward or stepping in place. In another, researchers tested whether the robot would take a tumble if it was periodically pushed with enough force to alter its direction.\n\nThe study showed that while one robot failed to stay upright for 3 out of 10 trials when asked to slightly speed up its gait, another could remain upright over 100 trials when pushed from its left side, but fell over during 5 out of 10 trials when the same force was applied to its right side.\n\nEventually, the researchers' framework could help certify the commercial deployment of legged robots and help establish a safety benchmark for robots created with different structures and properties, though Weng noted it'll be a while before it can be implemented.\n\n\"We believe this data-driven approach will help create an unbiased, more efficient way to make observations of robots in the conditions of a test environment,\" he said. \"What we're working towards isn't immediate, but for researchers down the line.\"\n\nCo-authors were Guillermo Castillo and Ayonga Hereid of Ohio State, and Wei Zhang of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

            "text": "This tiny soft robot can be steered through the branches of the lungs without causing damage for safer diagnosis.\n\nIn recent years, soft robotics has garnered a spotlight in the surgical field due to their scalability, flexibility, and the potential for safer interactions with biological tissues. These aspects of soft robotics are particularly beneficial in minimally invasive surgical procedures where surgeons must be able to perform many tasks within limited spaces.\n\nInterventional bronchoscopy procedures stand to benefit greatly from the development of soft robots because of the challenging paths that a bronchoscope must traverse. Coupled with the small diameters of the lung branches, this makes it very difficult with traditional tools to reach deeper in the lungs, where early tumors are generally found.\n\nHowever, when a robot is made smaller to fit in tighter spaces, it produces smaller forces before failing. This is especially relevant when the robot is made of soft materials.\n\nA miniature soft robot\n\nIn lung biopsy procedures, a biopsy needle must be able to transmit a puncturing force into the desired tissue. This is often made difficult by the fact that surgeons manually impose this force far away from the needle meaning the force must travel the whole length of a bronchoscope.\n\nSheila Russo, assistant professor in mechanical engineering at Boston University, and her lab have developed a soft robot that avoids compromising its force transmission for size. The robot has a cylindrical continuum shape with a 3.5 mm diameter so that it can easily move through the lungs and has a needle deployment mechanism mounted on its tip. Its design seeks to maximize the benefits of soft robots by embedding multiple degrees of freedom into a miniature form factor.\n\nThe robot, published in Advanced Intelligent Systems, comprises three independent, fluid pressure-driven actuators. Each one is designed so that upon increasing the internal pressure, the robot behavior is controlled. These actuators can steer the robot into the branches of the lungs, stabilize the robot tip once it is close to a target, and deploy a needle to take a biopsy of the targeted tumor. This new robot allows for greater control over the biopsy needle than is traditionally given to a surgeon.\n\n\u201cAn advantage of using soft materials,\u201d said Russo, \u201cis that we can exploit the fact that the robot can safely interact with biological tissue to anchor the robot within the lung branches.\u201d\n\nEnsuring safe operation\n\nStabilization of the robot is accomplished by a radially-expansive soft actuator embedded near its tip. Upon pressurization the actuator contacts the walls of the lung branch providing an anchor point from which the needle can be deployed. Deployment of the needle is then achieved with a linear soft actuator on the tip of the robot.\n\nThe robot is manufactured using a combination of silicone molding and microfabrication layering processes. Soft polymeric materials are used in these processes making the robot inherently flexible and highly scalable.\n\nThe researchers characterized each of the three mechanisms to demonstrate that the robot could both achieve high levels of flexibility and produce adequate forces to take a biopsy.\n\nThey validated this finding by placing the robot within a mock lung model and mimicking the intended surgical use. The robot was successful in using all of its actuation mechanisms to complete a simulated biopsy procedure.\n\n\u201cWe envision the robot as a quicker and more effective alternative to diagnose and treat lung cancer in its earlier stages,\u201d said Russo. \u201cThe development of such a robot opens the door to minimally invasive procedures that can be performed more effectively and efficiently, leading to overall more positive outcomes in the future of lung cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nReference: D.

The orbital residents also kept up a host of research activities as they serviced science gear, studied human research, and explored future technologies.\n\nThe next spacewalk is scheduled to begin at 8:15 a.m. EST on Thursday to continue upgrading the space station\u2019s power generation system. Flight Engineers Nicole Mann of NASA and Koichi Wakata of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) will spend about seven hours in the vacuum of space completing the hardware installation job that they began on Jan. 20 during their first spacewalk. NASA TV, on the agency\u2019s app and website, will begin live spacewalk coverage at 6:45 a.m.\n\nMann and Wakata started Tuesday morning organizing their tools, tethers, and other spacewalking components inside the Quest airlock ahead of Thursday\u2019s excursion. Afterward, the duo split up as Mann worked in the Columbus laboratory module and cleaned up the BioLab facility that enables research into microbes, cells, tissue cultures, and small invertebrates. Wakata later took a robotics test on a computer measuring his performance, behavior, and cognition while living in space.\n\nNASA Flight Engineers Josh Cassada and Frank Rubio worked throughout the day maintaining physics and biology hardware. Cassada installed the BioFabrication Facility in the Columbus lab that will be used to investigate manufacturing human organs in microgravity. Rubio worked in the Kibo laboratory module cleaning up the Life Science Glovebox following several days of advanced bone healing studies last week.\n\nTwo cosmonauts took turns today studying how future space crews might pilot spacecraft or robots on potential planetary missions. Roscosmos Commander Sergey Prokopyev and Flight Engineer Anna Kikina both wore a helmet with electrodes attached and simulated piloting techniques, such as docking a spaceship or commanding a robot on a planetary surface, on a computer.\n\nFlight Engineer Dmitri Petelin spent his morning investigating fluids exposed to magnetic and electric fields in microgravity. During the afternoon, he moved on to orbital lab maintenance and worked on an oxygen generator before servicing water and drainage valves.\n\nThe remotely-controlled Canadarm2 robotic arm jettisoned flight support equipment during the day that was delivered aboard the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Nov. 27, 2022, toward Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The flight hardware secured a pair of roll-out solar arrays inside Dragon\u2019s trunk during its ascent to orbit and rendezvous with the space station. The jettisoned support equipment drifted safely away from the station and will eventually harmlessly burn up in the atmosphere with no chance for recontacting the space station.\n\nLearn more about station activities by following the space station blog, @space_station and @ISS_Research on Twitter, as well as the ISS Facebook and ISS Instagram accounts.\n\nGet weekly video highlights at: https://roundupreads.jsc.nasa.gov/videupdate/\n\nGet the latest from NASA delivered every week.

Investment into companies providing robotics solutions for autonomous ground transportation such as sensors, autonomy \u2018stacks\u2019 and \u2018drivers\u2019, and whole cloth systems, was particularly strong.\n\nRobotics investments for the month of December 2022 totaled US $1.14B (See Table 1, below). This figure was the result of 55 investments, and represents a 7.7% increase over December 2021\u2019s funding total of $1.06B (representing 65 investments).\n\nDecember 2022 investment into companies providing robotics solutions for autonomous ground transportation such as sensors, autonomy \u2018stacks\u2019 and \u2018drivers\u2019, and whole cloth systems, was robust (Einride, Helm.ai, Jiuyao Intelligent, Kuandeng, Kodiak Robotics, PhiGent Robotics, and Fixposition provide examples). Firms providing products and services for industrial inspection, mapping and surveying also attracted solid funding amounts (Energy Robotics, Flybotix, and Exyn Technologies, for example).\n\nCompanies developing robotic interventional systems, primarily surgical platforms, were well represented (i.e. LEM Surgical, Ronovo Surgical, and Sinovation Medical), as well as developers of field robotics solutions such as Scythe Robotics and Na\u00efo Technologies.\n\nTable 1: December 2022 Robotics Funding and Investment\n\nAs described in Figure 1, China and the USA received the bulk of the funding rounds. The same holds for the total amount of December 2022 investment, with the exception of outlier Sweden which was buoyed by hundreds of millions poured in Swedish firm Einride, a producer of driverless electric trucks.\n\nFigure 1: December 2022 Robotics Investment by Country\n\nDecember 2022 funding and investment types followed a familiar pattern, with numerous early stage investments, and with large investments coming in later rounds or by other means.\n\nFigure 2: December 2022 Robotics Funding Amounts by Investment Type\n\nEditors\u2019 note: What defines robotics investments? The answer to this simple question is central in any attempt to quantify them with some degree of rigor. To make investment analyses consistent, repeatable, and valuable, it is critical to wring out as much subjectivity as possible during the evaluation process. This begins with a definition of terms and a description of assumptions.\n\nInvestors and investing\n\nInvestment should come from venture capital firms, corporate investment groups, angel investors, and other sources. Friends-and-family investments, government/non-governmental agency grants, and crowd-sourced funding are excluded.\n\nRobotics and intelligent systems companies\n\nRobotics companies must generate or expect to generate revenue from the production of robotics products (that sense, analyze, and act in the physical world), hardware or software subsystems and enabling technologies for robots, or services supporting robotics devices. For this analysis, autonomous vehicles (including technologies that support autonomous driving) and drones are considered robots, while 3D printers, CNC systems, and various types of \u201chard\u201d automation are not.\n\nCompanies that are \u201crobotic\u201d in name only, or use the term \u201crobot\u201d to describe products and services that that do not enable or support devices acting in the physical world, are excluded. For example, this includes \u201csoftware robots\u201d and robotic process automation. Many firms have multiple locations in different countries. Company locations given in the analysis are based on the publicly listed headquarters in legal documents, press releases, etc.\n\nVerification\n\nFunding information is collected from a number of public and private sources. These include press releases from corporations and investment groups, corporate briefings, imarket research firms, and association and industry publications. In addition, information comes from sessions at conferences and seminars, as well as during private interviews with industry representatives, investors, and others. Unverifiable investments are excluded and estimates are made where investment amounts are not provided or are\n\n",

See below\n\nThe Colorado-based commercial space company stated that its Large Integrated Flexible Environment (LIFE) habitat completed a third stress test, exceeding NASA\u2019s requirements.\n\n\u201cThis latest assessment, called an Accelerated Systematic Creep Test, is a destructive materials testing method by which test engineers load the test unit \u2014 a subscale version of the inflatable habitat \u2014 with a sustained amount of pressure over time until it fails,\u201d explained the company in a press release.\n\nIn the December 2022 test conducted at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., the shell of the unit burst after more than 150 hours of pressure being inflated, going beyond NASA\u2019s short-term recommended creep duration of 100 hours, stated Sierra Space.\n\nNASA created a climate-controlled, disposable building where the unit was testedb and this building was designed to meet two requirements: To protect the unit\u2019s shell during the test and to be expendable once the unit burst, explained Sierra Space.\n\n\u201cSierra Space\u2019s LIFE pressure shell has an on-orbit performance requirement of 15 years, but with softgoods, there is a \u2018times four\u2019 safety requirement set by NASA, so we must ultimately prove we\u2019re viable for 60 years,\u201d stated LIFE Chief Engineer and Senior Director of Engineering Shawn Buckley in the press release. \u201cBased on data from this first subscale creep test, we well exceeded the on-orbit mission performance requirement of 60 years for inflatable structures within our current architecture.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Spectrum News, Buckley gave a further explanation of the latest test.\n\n\u201cThe subscale units are purpose built to test the performance of the LIFE habitat pressure shell. One of the requirements is to bring the unit to failure to capture the systematic performance. The captured data provides the engineering team with key information that can be compared to predicted performance,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo previous tests were completed in July and November of 2022 and showed the units pressurized until they burst at the maximum Ultimate Burst Pressure, Sierra Space stated.\n\nA second subscale Systematic Accelerated Creep Test is expected in early 2023, Sierra Space stated. If all goes according to plan, later this year additional stress tests will be done on the company\u2019s full-scale LIFE units.\n\n\u201cThe Sierra Space softgoods certification testing campaign will continue into 2023 with a series of subscale and full-scale tests. Next up is another subscale Creep test then followed by our first full scale LIFE Ultimate Burst Pressure test,\u201d stated Buckley to Spectrum News.\n\nWhat\u2019s a LIFE habitat unit?\n\nIt is an inflatable habitat that will be 27 feet in diameter and 27 feet long (three stories tall), described the company.\n\nIt will have three floors that are designed for a human crew of four astronauts (and update to 12 for shorter periods) that will provide living and workspace, such as:\n\nScience labs\n\nRobotics work stations\n\nMedical and sick bay\n\nSleep and hygiene quarters\n\nGalley\n\nExercise equipment\n\nThe unit is designed to extend missions to low-Earth orbit missions, the moon and Mars.\n\nBuckley told Spectrum News that the company hopes to put the LIFE units in action before 2030.\n\n\u201cSierra Space is building the first commercial space station, Orbital Reef, with our partner Blue Origin. LIFE will be the primary habitation units on that station, which will be operational by the end of the decade,\u201d he stated.",

The facilities will feature \u201cstate-of-the-art automation and robotics,\u201d according to a release.\n\nSam\u2019s Club also plans to add more fulfillment space within its new stores \u2014 which, at 160,000 square feet, are set to be larger than most current locations. The new stores will have space dedicated for curbside pickup and home deliveries.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSupply chain technology is at the center of Walmart\u2019s plans to expand omnichannel fulfillment and boost productivity within its stores, and the retail giant is bringing the same mindset to its Sam\u2019s Club subsidiary.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to place ourselves on the cutting edge of efficiency and automation, unique to our business model,\u201d Joseph Godsey, SVP of Supply Chain at Sam\u2019s Club, said in a statement.\n\nWalmart has invested heavily to integrate automation within its fulfillment operations. The retailer will build four high-tech fulfillment centers over the next few years, and has taken a majority stake in warehouse automation technology provider Symbotic with plans to roll out the tech across all its regional distribution centers.\n\nTechnology, combined with better data, will allow Walmart to operate an advanced supply chain at a lower cost, President and CEO Doug McMillon said at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference in December.\n\n\u201cIf you can understand demand, get even better at forecasting with today's forecasting tools, and then have a supply chain that's got data algorithms and robotics in it, you can take costs out of the system that we've not ever been able to take out before,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Sam\u2019s Club, automation, combined with an expanded fulfillment network, will put the wholesaler closer to customers and allow it to deliver orders faster. Sam\u2019s Club will retrofit a number of existing facilities to enhance \u201cphysical and digital capabilities,\u201d which the announcement says will also speed deliveries.\n\nSam\u2019s Club also aims to make the most of its new store locations by reserving space for fulfillment. The retailer plans to open its first new store in Florida in 2024, and noted the new locations will include walk-in coolers and expanded doors for outgoing delivery truck efficiency.",

            "text": "Education and Career\n\nDavid Saint-Jacques was born in Qu\u00e9bec City on 6 January 1970. He grew up in Saint-Lambert, a small, residential city on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River across from Montreal. His father and grandfather were both engineers. (See also Engineering.) In 1993, he earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in engineering physics from Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al (formerly \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al).\n\nHe then worked for a time in biomedical engineering at the Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital in Paris. Saint-Jacques was part of the team improving the design of radiological equipment for cine-angiography, the recording of fluoroscopic images of the chambers and blood vessels of the heart.\n\nIn 1998, he earned a PhD in astrophysics at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile completing his PhD, Saint-Jacques contributed to advances on Cambridge\u2019s Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope and the Canary Islands\u2019 William Hershel Telescope. His post-doctoral work included helping to develop the Mitaka infrared interferometer array in Japan and the Subaru telescope adaptive optics system at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii (see Observatory).\n\nIn 2001 he returned to Canada, where he worked with other astrophysicists at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (see Astrophysics). Saint-Jacques completed his medical degree at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Qu\u00e9bec City in 2005. He also undertook more medical training in Lebanon and Guatemala. In 2007, Saint-Jacques completed his residency at McGill University in Montreal and focused on practicing medicine in remote communities.\n\nDavid Saint-Jacques began his medical career in Puvirnituq, Nunavik, a small Inuit village on the shore of Hudson Bay. He was the co-chief of medicine at the Inuulitsivik Health Centre, providing medical care to seven Inuit communities. He also worked as an adjunct professor of family medicine at McGill University, supervising medical trainees in Nunavik.\n\nAstronaut\n\nIn May 2009, following a rigorous selection process involving over 5,000 candidates, the Canadian Space Agency chose David Saint-Jacques to be one of two new Canadian astronauts. He moved to Houston to begin his astronaut candidate training with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He graduated in 2011.\n\nSaint-Jacques\u2019 first major assignment was as part of the international crew at NASA\u2019s Extreme Environment Mission Operations near Key Largo, Florida. He and fellow Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen worked with others from the class of 2009, learning to navigate a DeepWorker submarine while completing experiments during a 13-day underwater mission designed to simulate work on an asteroid.\n\nHe also completed training in International Space Station systems. In the United States and Russia, he learned about space walks, robotics, summer and winter wilderness survival tactics, and how to fly a T38-N jet.\n\nIn 2012, Saint-Jacques undertook a challenging training mission called Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising Human Behaviour and Performance Skills (CAVES). It simulates working in the international space station by having astronauts live and conduct experiments in cramped quarters in a cave, 4 km underground. Participants learned to cooperate as a team while enduring difficult working and living conditions.\n\nExpedition 58/59\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) was built through the cooperative efforts of the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. Since construction began in 1998, it has orbited 400 km above the earth at a speed of 28,000 km per hour. Since 2000, it has been occupied by astronauts from at least 20 countries who conduct experiments in its six laboratories with the goal of advancing space exploration while benefitting life on earth.\n\nIn May 2016, Saint-Jacques was chosen to serve on the Expedition 58/59 mission to the ISS. David Saint-Jacques personally named the mission Perspective. According to the Canadian Space Agency, Saint-Jacques explained, \u201cI'm looking forward to seeing our home from space for myself, without borders or differences, and can't wait to share my experience and new perspective with others.\" To prepare for the mission he undertook two more years of intense training in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Russia.\n\nWith American astronaut Anne McClain and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, Saint-Jacques blasted off from a base in Kazakhstan on 3 December 2018. They would not return to earth until 24 June 2019. To date, his 204 days in space is the longest mission of any Canadian astronaut. During the mission, he conducted many experiments, acted as the crew\u2019s medical officer, completed maintenance tasks and operated the Canadarm 2. He also became the fourth Canadian astronaut to conduct a spacewalk.\n\nWhile serving on the ISS, Saint-Jacques sent many photographs and videos to earth. He also participated in Exploring Earth, an educational program designed for students that used pictures he was taking from space to enhance understanding of the earth\u2019s geological and built features.\n\nWhen asked what motivates him to undertake challenges in so many fields, Saint-Jacques said, \u201cTo understand: that is my main motivation\u2026I've always wanted to get to the bottom of things and go beyond books and theory. I'm naturally curious and drawn by discovery and adventure.\u201d\n\nPersonal Life\n\nDavid Saint-Jacques is married to Dr. V\u00e9ronique Morin, a family doctor with a master\u2019s degree in public health who has practiced medicine in Nunavik, Montreal and Houston, Texas. They have three children, Pierre, L\u00e9on and Sophie.\n\nSaint-Jacques obtained his commercial pilot and advanced scuba diving licences, and enjoys sailing, cycling, mountain climbing, skiing and rowing. He is fluent in English and French and speaks conversational Russian, Japanese, and Spanish. (See also Languages in Use in Canada.)\n\nHonours and Awards",
