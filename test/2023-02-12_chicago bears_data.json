            "text": "As we inch closer to the 2023 NFL Draft, prospects will continue to rise at key positions. For the Chicago Bears, one of those key positions of need remains at wide receiver.\n\nGoing into this next season, we will likely see Darnell Mooney, Chase Claypool, Velus Jones Jr. and Equanimeous St. Brown as the four wideouts with pretty comfortable jobs. Two other spots, though, will be up for grabs. Most notably, the Bears need an alpha wide receiver.\n\nThe first round of the 2023 NFL Draft could see a handful of those taken, including TCU\u2019s Quenton Johnston, USC\u2019s Jordan Addison and Ohio State\u2019s Jaxon Smith-Njigba.\n\nBut, moving past that first round, the Bears could find themselves another great option and pay less draft capital to get him. The Bears will undoubtedly trade the number 1 overall pick, giving them some additional picks in this draft and likely next year\u2019s. With multiple picks in the second or third round probable, Chicago should look at SMU standout receiver Rashee Rice.\n\nHe isn\u2019t a first-round name, but Rashee Rice could become the alpha receiver the Chicago Bears have needed.\n\nOne thing people may not know about Rice is that he was given multiple Power 5 offers, but chose SMU. It\u2019s not like there was a lack of talent coming out of high school. He\u2019s always been one of \u201cthose dudes.\u201d\n\nAt 6-foot-3, Rice has the prototypical frame you want to see in a dominant outside receiver. He\u2019s got size, too, weighing around 205lbs.\n\nRice is an athlete, being able to go up and make tremendous catches at the point of attack. He uses his body well, whether it\u2019s to position himself for his quarterback or to maneuver after the catch and gain extra yardage. The strength is evident within his frame.\n\nRice has a noted \u201calpha mentality\u201d according to his draft profiles, and that\u2019s just what the Bears need. They not only need that mentality, but the proof on the field, and Rice could give them just that.\n\nLast year at SMU, Rice caught 96 passes for 1,355 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nThis is a player who is comfortable running different routes, but hasn\u2019t had the chance to showcase all of what he\u2019s capable of. That\u2019s one reason he might fall a little bit, but his route running is nothing to worry about and should translate well because of his physical tools.\n\nIf Rice is there anywhere from the late second to late third round, he is absolutely worth a pick and could allow the Bears to focus on building the trenches with higher capital.",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears won\u2019t tell anybody what their plans are for the #1 pick. Yes, the popular idea is they will trade it. That remains the strongest possibility. However, there remains a likelihood they could stay put and make the pick. Perhaps the market for trades doesn\u2019t develop as GM Ryan Poles hopes, or maybe he falls in love with a particular player he isn\u2019t willing to pass on. Experts have weighed in with their thoughts. Predictably, the predictions vary. So what if one took human bias out of the equation?\n\n\n\n\n\nCynthia Frelund is among the most noteworthy analytics experts in the field. She uses straight numbers and computer simulations to determine how things will play out. She decided to conduct her own mock draft with these methods. Her choice for the Bears ended up being a familiar face, but how she arrived at it was a bit more technical.\n\n\u201cThe Bears\u2019 defensive front has many areas to address, and (Jalen) Carter has the profile to offer immediate help. His burst is the best in the class, per computer vision, and his run stopping ranks in the top 15 percent in the past eight seasons. Alignment versatility should help change the Bears\u2019 ability to bring pressure and sacks, both areas where they ranked last in the league in 2022, with just 96 pressures and 20 sacks.\u201d\n\nHonestly, when the film study and raw data line up like this, it\u2019s hard to deny. If the Bears stay put at #1, everything points to Carter being their choice.\n\nThe Chicago Bears must crystalize their thoughts on Carter.\n\nMost evaluators agree the Georgia defensive tackle is the best pure talent in the 2023 class. When he is on, there wasn\u2019t an offensive lineman in college football that could block him. That said, his lack of production and conditioning questions have led some to wonder how impactful he can be at the NFL level. It is never good when a player has questions about his work ethic. That is why the interviews Chicago will undoubtedly have with him over the next month could determine what they do with the pick. If he blows them away, it is possible Poles may not want to pass on what he may see as a future superstar.\n\nCarter has drawn comparisons to Philadelphia Eagles great Fletcher Cox. He has been the heart and soul for some great Eagles defenses with 65 career sacks, six Pro Bowls, and a Super Bowl ring. Now he\u2019s one game away from securing another. The best Chicago Bears defenses always had a dominant interior pass rush presence. Steve McMichael in the 1980s. Tommie Harris in the 2000s. Poles and Eberflus know how valuable somebody like that can be. If they think Carter is in that league, then staying put at #1 makes sense.",

Then came Belichick and Brady in 2000, when they came they established a winning culture of making 9 Super Bowls from 2001 to 2018, when they were 6-3 in that span.\n\nThe Patriots currently have the most wins and losses in Super Bowl history, they\u2019re tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for most wins and tied with the Denver Broncos for most Super Bowl losses.\n\nThere have been very heartbreaking losses, and there are a few that were expected, and we\u2019ll take a look at those distinctions shortly.\n\nSuper Bowl XX: New England Patriots shellacked by the Chicago Bears\n\nThe 1985 Patriots had one of their most Cinderella seasons in team history. They were 11-5 on the season, and they were 11-5 and in third place in the AFC East behind the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, and the No. 5 seed in the AFC. They upset the No. 4 Jets in the Wild Card round, as the Wild Card teams would face each other at the time. Next, they upset the No. 1 Los Angeles Raiders in the Divisional round. Then, at the Orange Bowl they defeated the No. 2 Dolphins in the AFC Championship, otherwise known as The Squish the Fish game.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chicago Bears had one of the best seasons in NFL History in 1985 as they were 15-1, with the only loss being against the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football.\n\nThe Bears were expected to win the Super Bowl, and boy did they blow the Patriots out. The score was 46-10, and the Bears had the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history at the time. They had the record for the biggest blowout until four years later when the 49ers blew out the Broncos 55-10, and they still have the record to this day.\n\nPatriots quarterback Tony Eason started at quarterback, and was replaced by Patriots legend Steve Grogan after a poor performance of 0/6, which made him the only Super Bowl starting quarterback to not complete a pass in the big game.\n\nAlthough this was a blowout, this is only the least disappointing Super Bowl loss for the New England Patriots.\n\n!\u2014pageview_candidate\u2014>",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears have a lot of cap space, but so many holes to fill as well. We will finally see how Ryan Poles wants to construct a team. While many will want a big-name edge rusher, the reality is that the Bears will probably need to add multiple defensive linemen this off-season. One name to keep an eye on is Rasheem Green.\n\nShould Chicago Bears sign Rasheem Green?\n\nRasheem Green is a former third-round pick from the Seattle Seahawks. After four years with the Seahawks, he spent last season with the Houston Texans. Despite five NFL seasons under his belt, he will just be 26 years old next season. The age fits the type of players that Ryan Poles would like to bet on. At age 26, there is still a chance we have not seen the best from Rasheem Green.\n\nGreen played minimally as a rookie, and was a notable rotation player in years two and three before being one of the highest-playing pass rushers on the 2021 Seahawks. Last season he had 26 pressures, and 22 run stops.\n\nFans can act like they are above the services of Rasheem Green because he is not an exciting name, but only Trevis Gipson had more pressure, with 30. Still, Green had a higher win rate of 11.6% compared to 10.5% and was more productive on a snap-by-snap basis. Beyond that, nobody on the Chicago Bears had more run stops than Rasheem Green last season.\n\nGreen signed for only $3.5M last season, and he was more productive in every area compared to Al-Quadin Muhammad, who signed for slightly more.\n\nThe Chicago Bears are probably going to add a big-name pass rusher. Still, if they added Rasheem Green, and drafted Will Anderson, those two would be starters. Meanwhile, they would still have Dominique Robinson and Trevis Gipson as depth. Even if they signed another player, drafted Anderson, and had Green as their third rusher, he is a better depth option than Gipson and Robinson at this point.\n\nRasheem Green had a normal year for his standards, and coming from the Houston Texans will not do wonders for his market. If the Chicago Bears can sign Green to the same deal as Al-Quadin Muhammad he would definitely be a better bet than the one they made last year around this time.",

            "text": "Some Scenarios See Bears Trade Fields, Select QB at No. 1\n\nPart of Fields\u2019 curiosity is due to the fact that Chicago\u2019s decision at No. 1 will likely impact him significantly. It could even potentially lead to Fields playing for a new team in 2023.\n\nThe Bears can tread several different paths at the top of the draft, including trading the semi-established Fields for a humongous draft haul and/or proven players, then selecting a quarterback first overall. While that option is probably a few slots down the list of the most likely outcomes, it has been pitched publicly by former NFL general manager and current ESPN analyst Mike Tannenbaum.\n\n\u201cI would trade Justin Fields,\u201d Tannenbaum said on ESPN\u2019s morning show Get Up on January 10. \u201cIf you can get at least a first- and a third-round pick, which I believe you can because so many teams need a quarterback, I\u2019m gonna draft Bryce Young who I think is going to be a better quarterback than Justin Fields.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when I do that, and get at least a first- and a third-round pick, I\u2019m resetting Bryce Young\u2019s rookie contract and I\u2019m gonna be able to get at least four starting caliber players,\u201d he continued.\n\nTannenbaum\u2019s proposal has gotten a little traction in the month since he made it, though logic dictates the Bears will hold onto Fields because, as the old clich\u00e9 goes, \u201cA bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\u201d\n\nChicago already knows it has a budding superstar in its versatile dual-threat QB. Fields would have set the all-time record for rushing yards at the position with ease in just his second year had he not sat two regular season games. Fields\u2019 passing numbers also improved significantly year-over-year, both in terms of traditional counting statistics and advanced analytics.\n\nYoung may prove to be a great NFL quarterback, but dismissing Fields after just two seasons in Chicago and selecting Young would be fireable offense on the part of general manager Ryan Poles should it fail to pan out.\n\nPoles Recently Offered Hint on Bears\u2019 Plans For Top NFL Draft Pick\n\nThe most probable outcome is that the Bears trade down, once for sure and possibly twice, to maximize value both in the first round and across the 2023 draft.\n\nESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler reported on February 3 that competing franchises around the NFL largely expect that to be Chicago\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cTeams are keeping close tabs on the Bears, who own the No. 1 pick in April\u2019s draft, and the prevailing theme is Poles is very high on value,\u201d Fowler wrote. \u201cDespite in-season trades of linebacker Roquan Smith and edge rusher Robert Quinn, Chicago has just eight picks in the draft and only one in the top 50. Poles will most likely aim to change that.\u201d\n\nChicago can trade back and still procure a high-level prospect to improve the pass rush, the interior of the defensive line or fill holes on the offensive line \u2014 all three of which are areas that must be addressed this offseason. The extra draft capital the Bears acquire in the move(s) may also help the team land a true No. 1 wide receiver, a benefit Fields has yet to be afforded during his NFL career.",

Competing franchises expect that GM Ryan Poles will aim to maximize value by trading down once or twice in order to acquire more draft capital."

            "text": "PHOENIX \u2014 It took less than a week for Andy Reid to get from Philadelphia to Kansas City.\n\nThe Eagles fired their coach after 14 years on Dec. 30, 2012. After a clandestine meeting at the Philadelphia airport with Chiefs brass, Reid agreed to take the job Jan. 4, 2013.\n\nMatt Nagy, an Eagles assistant who followed Reid to the Chiefs, still remembers what happened in Reid\u2019s first meeting with his new players. After spending a stressful season under fire in Philadelphia \u2014 he was booed as often by locals as another red-clad large man with facial hair, Santa Claus \u2014 Reid was treated as a conquering hero by veterans Tamba Hali, Derrick Johnson and Eric Berry.\n\n\u201cThese vets that were sitting there were staring at him like he\u2019s this beautiful alien that came out of nowhere that\u2019s going to take us to the promised land,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cAnd he did it.\n\n\u201cIt was refreshing to go from Philly to that.\u201d\n\nIt took him seven years to do just that. The Chiefs beat the 49ers 31-20 in the Super Bowl three years ago, thanks to a ridiculous third-and-15 throw \u2014 remember \u201cJet Chip Wasp?\u201d \u2014 from Patrick Mahomes to Tyreek Hill. Down 10, the Chiefs completed the 44-yard pass midway through the fourth quarter, sparking a 21-0 run to pull away.\n\nThen the Bears coach, Nagy was sitting in his basement, whose walls were lined with his old call sheets, watching the game by himself. He choked up when his flat-screen television showed confetti floating to the ground.\n\n\u201cYou just get emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cI was by myself. I was watching it. I was not a part of it, but I was so happy for him to finally have that moment.\u201d\n\nUp until then, Reid was known as the coach who couldn\u2019t win the big game. He only had three losing records with the Eagles but lost four times in the NFC title game. After he won the conference title, he lost to the -Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX.\n\n\u201cNo one does it as good as him,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cThe right way. The way you treat people, the way you teach people, the relationships. He is, in my opinion, the best to ever do it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s overstating things \u2014 but Reid could make an argument for the second-best modern coach, behind Bill Belichick, with a victory Sunday in the Super Bowl against the same Eagles.\n\nOnly Belichick has more postseason wins than Reid\u2019s 21. Counting playoff games, Reid has won 268 games, the fifth-most in NFL history. He trails only Belichick, Don Shula, George Halas and Tom Landry.\n\nTeams have spent the last two decades trying to find the next Reid, hiring young play-callers as coaches. The Eagles\u2019 Nick -Sirianni is one. So was Nagy.\n\nIt\u2019s not lost on Reid that his chance to win a second Super Bowl in three times is coming against the Eagles, the team that fired him just over 10 years ago. It hit him hard at first.\n\n\u201cInitially,\u201d he said, \u201cthat was quite a deal.\u201d\n\nHe has spent the last two weeks or so trying to get over it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing for the Eagles,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the Chiefs to be in this position. Once you get through all that, now it\u2019s just the teams playing each other. It doesn\u2019t really matter, the uniform.\u201d",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears may have found a franchise quarterback in Justin Fields. While the Bears finished the 2022 campaign with the worst record in the league, the season as a whole didn't feel like an \"L\" due to the play of their second-year signal-caller.\n\nFields completed 60.4 percent of his passes for 2,242 yards, 17 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 15 games played. He made his biggest impact on the ground, as the Ohio State product rushed for 1,143 yards and eight touchdowns. It was the second-best rushing season for a quarterback in NFL history behind Lamar Jackson, and he set an NFL record by rushing for 178 yards against the Miami Dolphins in November.\n\nFields is a rising star. Even his former head coach, Matt Nagy, said this week that Fields will \"without a doubt\" play in a Super Bowl one day. The Bears now face a pivotal offseason. Armed with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft and the most projected cap space in the league, Chicago is poised for a quick turnaround if it can make the correct decisions.\n\nAhead of Super Bowl LVII, Fields spoke with CBS Sports about a variety of different topics, including his impressive rushing campaign, Ohio State quarterback C.J. Stroud and what he hopes to improve on moving forward.\n\nCBS Sports: You got an MVP vote at NFL Honors. How did that feel?\n\nFields: It feels great. It feels great. Hopefully I can get more in these next few years. But it was awesome for sure.\n\nLast season, you took the league by storm with your legs. We knew you were a mobile quarterback, but we didn't exactly know that you were the second coming of Michael Vick. Did you know that you were capable of creating highlight play after highlight play with your legs like that?\n\nFields: To be honest with you, no. I think I surprised myself a little bit with some of the plays I made last year. But it was awesome to see. Couldn't have done it without my coaches and my teammates and of course God. Like you said, we knew that I could run like that, but even myself, I didn't know that I could run the show like that and create big plays with my legs like that, so it was definitely awesome to see for sure.\n\nWhat do you think you learned about yourself in your second NFL season?\n\nFields: Just that there's going to be a lot of ups and downs and that a lot of games come down to the last possession of the game or one or two plays, so you gotta play every play like it's going to be the most important play of the game.\n\nIt almost seemed like there was a change in offense for the Bears heading into the Patriots matchup in Week 7. You started running the football more and the offense as a whole looked different. Can you speak on that? Did you guys have a moment with the coaching staff where you came together and decided to switch it up?\n\nFields: No not really. We had a new head coach this year, new offensive coordinator, so they needed time to see what we did well as an offense, you know, what everyone did well, what the offensive line did well, what our receivers did well, what I did well, what our running backs did well. So I think it took them a little bit to get that together, but after it did click, I mean, we went on a four-five-game streak where we were putting up 28-plus points each and every game. Just hope to get that start next year to where we start fast, put up a lot of points and just come up big in those late-game moments.\n\nSo your Bears have the No. 1 overall pick. What's the best course of action? Is there a player you like, or is it smart to trade down. What would general manager Justin Fields do?\n\nFields: I've never been a general manager before, so I'm not sure. But I think there are a lot of great players coming out. I haven't looked at too much film on them. But I'm just glad that I don't have to focus on that and don't have to worry about what we're going to do with the No. 1 pick. I'm going to leave that up to Ryan Poles, and I believe in him, he's going to get us in the right position. He knows what we need with our football team.\n\nWe have another Ohio State product coming out in this class in C.J. Stroud. You've been through this draft process. What advice would you give him?\n\nFields: Throughout all the interviews and stuff like that, I would just tell him to be himself. Don't stress too much when it comes to the combine, Pro Day and that these coaches saw him ball out in the playoff game that he was in against probably the best defense college has seen. He definitely did his thing this year, I'm proud of him and I know what kind of person he is. I've known him since he was in high school and just his work ethic, how he carries himself, he's a great guy, a great leader and once he really starts going and ... kinda get that confidence up, it's hard to stop him. So I'm excited for him to see where he goes, for sure.\n\nRyan Poles has done a tremendous job setting the Bears up to be major players in free agency. Have you had any conversations with him about the plan of attack, or maybe areas of need that you specifically want addressed as the quarterback?\n\nFields: Not really. We had an exit meeting after the season and he asked me what kind of pocket did I like. Did I like more within the pocket or more depth in the pocket and stuff like that. Just asking me general questions like that to kind of get a better idea of what areas I like, what kind of receivers I like and stuff like that. So it was just mostly general questions.\n\nWhat are you focused on entering 2023. Is there anything specific you want to show the organization to further your case as an up-and-coming star?\n\nFields: Yeah, I think I can definitely take a step in the passing game. Especially on those quick throws and those short throws, those skinny throws that I might have lost my mechanics. I was too tired from running the ball or something like that. So really just get my mechanics down at the start of this offseason, and get it down to a point where no matter how tired I am, the ball is going to come out the same, boom, and just get those completions and really stack those and watch my completion percentage shoot up.\n\nDo you have a Super Bowl prediction? Who are you riding with this weekend?\n\nFields: I think it's going to be a very close game, but I'm picking the Eagles to win. I think they're loaded on offense and defense. I think they have a lot of depth on their D-Line, their front seven is great, their offensive line is great. They have two weapons on the outside with A.J. (Brown) and DeVonta (Smith), and I think Jalen (Hurts) is going to have to have a big game. Kansas City, they play a lot of man coverage, they mix it up a pretty good bit with a little bit of Cover 2. So I think it's going to be a tough game and we'll see who comes out on top, but I'm picking the Eagles to win.\n\nI saw you partnered with Marriott Bonvoy to style out two Marriott Bonvoy members, tell me a little bit about that.\n\nFields: I got a chance to style a couple last week for events going on this week. It was three outfits: One of the outfits was airport attire, one for the NFL Honors and the third was the Courtyard house party. It was cool getting to know them. Marriott has been doing these exclusive access to NFL events since 2016. Being with them for the past couple years, it's been awesome getting to know people, getting to meet new people, talking to them about their favorite NFL teams, favorite NFL moments, stuff like that.",

            "text": "Multiple former general managers and other NFL people have said the Chicago Bears should seriously consider trading Justin Fields. They have the #1 pick, allowing them to take any QB in the draft they prefer. Fields\u2019 trade value is still high, with two years left on his rookie deal and the improvements he showed in 2022. The QB himself stated he feels he\u2019s done enough to earn another year with the team but admitted he has no control over what GM Ryan Poles plans to do. That uncertainty is why the speculation continues.\n\n\n\n\n\nESPN insider Jeremy Fowler decided to ask around the league about this situation. From what he gathers, Poles is standing by his word. He will evaluate the quarterbacks in this draft class as he would every year. That is his responsibility. It doesn\u2019t automatically mean anything will happen.\n\nAs debate rages on what the Chicago Bears do with the No. 1 pick, this quote from an NFL coach stuck with me, and speaks to Justin Fields\u2019 upside: \u201c[The Bears] had no business being in some of the games they were in this year \u2014 that was because of Fields.\u201d The great quarterbacks can overcome roster deficiencies. Fields seems to have that element, even if he needs more polish as a pocket passer.\n\nThis is something easy to forget. The Bears played six games during a stretch from November 6th through December 18th. Four were by five points or less to the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Atlanta Falcons, and Philadelphia Eagles. Three teams finished with winning records, two made the playoffs, and one is in the Super Bowl. The Bears averaged 27.5 points scored in those games, and it was almost exclusively because of Fields.\n\nJustin Fields deserves more time.\n\nHe didn\u2019t exactly have the ideal situation around him for quarterback development. The regime that drafted him in 2021 was fired after one season. He had to switch offensive schemes going into Year 2 and had a supporting cast lacking any sort of star power. The offensive line was makeshift all season due to injuries. Darnell Mooney failed to play the entire season. Despite everything, Fields almost broke the single-season rushing record for a quarterback and improved his passer rating from his rookie season.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the two games this team played without Justin Fields were losses by a combined total of 60-23. The guy did everything he could to make the Bears competitive. Their record doesn\u2019t tell the story of how close they were in so many of those games. It isn\u2019t crazy to think this team can make a quick turnaround in 2023 if they sufficiently upgrade the roster. So unless one of these draft quarterbacks makes an all-time great impression on Poles and Matt Eberflus, this idea of trading Fields should be buried.",

            "text": "PHOENIX \u2014 Andy Reid\u2019s wife, Tammy, grew up in Arizona. The Chiefs coach has been coming to the Phoenix area for more than half his life to visit her family.\n\n\u201cI remember driving from Los Angeles, and I-10 stopped right by where the stadium is,\u201d Reid said this week. \u201cYou\u2019d get off and drive through a bunch of fields there to get to Glendale. It\u2019s grown and grown and grown.\u201d\n\nBuilt 16 years ago for $455 million, State Farm Stadium is the spaceship-shaped symbol of the Valley\u2019s suburban sprawl. An economic ecosystem has developed around it \u2014 an arena and a nearby mall with bars and restaurants that fans flock to on game day.\n\nIt sounds a lot like what the Bears want to build in Arlington Heights, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nThe Bears are in escrow on the 326-acre former Arlington International Racecourse property and hope to close in the next few months. The complex, if built, is expected to feature a domed stadium with hotels, restaurants and shopping. Outgoing Bears president/CEO Ted Phillips said the team wants a \u201cwonderfully 365-day-a-year entertainment district.\u201d\n\nPhillips\u2019 replacement, former Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren, has a soft spot for games in the Phoenix area. He grew up there and gets to see his family when his teams play at State Farm Stadium. But although he\u2019s a self-professed stadium nerd, he didn\u2019t exactly sing the stadium\u2019s praises last month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s held up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the issue is the location, that it\u2019s kind of . . . it\u2019s far out.\u201d\n\nFar out? The site of Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl is about 13 miles northwest of downtown Phoenix. Arlington Heights is about 30 miles northwest of downtown Chicago.\n\nThe distance is less of an issue than it was when State Farm Stadium was built, said Kevin Phelps, Glendale\u2019s city manager. Some projections show that two out of three newcomers to the Phoenix area will live in the West Valley.\n\n\u201cIf [the Bears] develop the 326 acres as they envision and they create a sense of place, I think they can be very successful,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t even think about the time it takes to drive there.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the Bears hope \u2014 although fans in the city are already arguing otherwise.\n\nIf they construct their dome in Arlington Heights, the Bears hope to land a Super Bowl. And they\u2019d likely get one, too, as a make-good by the NFL for building a stadium, the way Minnesota and the New York area have received Super Bowls in the last decade. But like those other cold-weather cities, Arlington Heights likely would be left out of the NFL\u2019s permanent rotation. The Super Bowl will be held in Las Vegas next year and New Orleans in 2025.\n\nThe Bears also could host NCAA basketball Final Fours on a regular basis. Glendale will hold its second next year.\n\nThe last time Glendale hosted a Super Bowl, it had about 800 hotel rooms near the stadium. By next year, that number will be 3,000.

But a new development has to deliver.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a \u2018there\u2019 there,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how good your advertising is. If we told everyone to come to Glendale and they got here and there was an ice cream shop and a Denny\u2019s and that\u2019s all there is, you\u2019d never get them back again.\u201d\n\nThe Bears are hoping to build more than a Denny\u2019s. They don\u2019t plan to do what the Cardinals are most known for, though. They want a fixed-roof dome, not a retractable one. The Cardinals grow grass outside State Farm Stadium and slide it into place for games. The Bears likely would opt for artificial turf, Phillips said, and have talked to the NFL about advancements in the product.\n\nIf the Bears build their new home, it will undoubtedly look different than the Glendale spaceship. The surrounding development, on the other hand, could look awfully familiar.\n\n",

            "text": "The top of the 2023 NFL Draft has a trio of quarterbacks that figure to be the object of affection for numerous general managers. Alabama\u2019s Bryce Young, Ohio State\u2019s C.J. Stroud, and Kentucky\u2019s Will Levis are at the top of draft boards and wish lists of quarterback-needy teams. And even though the Chicago Bears are publicly saying that they\u2019re rolling with Justin Fields moving forward, there is some due diligence that must be done at the position.\n\nAnd ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler says the Bears are ready to do it.\n\n\u201cThe Bears will do their homework on Young, Stroud and Will Levis atop the draft,\u201d Fowler says in a roundup of Super Bowl week buzz at ESPN. \u201cBut Fields\u2019 ceiling remains mighty high.\u201d\n\nIn other words, GM Ryan Poles is preparing to do his job this offseason.\n\nThe Bears *SHOULD* be doing their homework on Young, Stroud, and Levis. Even if they aren\u2019t planning on picking one of these quarterbacks, knowledge is power. Knowing these prospects in and out could be vital to their plans to trade the No. 1 overall pick. The more they know about these QBs, the more informed their conversations will be with teams wanting to cut a deal. Any bit of information the Bears can relay to teams wanting to draft a quarterback could be helpful.\n\nPersonally, I rage when thinking about how former GM Ryan Pace dug deeper in his search for kicking help in 2019 than he did when looking for a quarterback in the 2017 NFL Draft. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I enjoyed following that circus. Although, I\u2019d prefer to never do that again. Anyway, seeing Pace\u2019s replacement, Ryan Poles, preparing to go on fact-finding missions regarding this quarterback class is encouraging. It\u2019s amazing how doing the basics of your job reflects well on you.\n\nIn the end, the Bears diving deep into the quarterback class is kind of a \u201cduh\u201d report. Even still \u2026 it is encouraging that Poles is leaving no stone left unturned. Here\u2019s hoping that homework helps the Bears get an \u201cA\u201d in their draft efforts in April.",

            "text": "The Chicago Bears have a lot of work to do in the offseason after finishing the season with a 3-14 record and sitting in last place in the NFC North.\n\nThe Bears appear to have an athletic quarterback who is capable of spectacular plays in Justin Fields, and much is expected of him in the future. While he has already put his game-breaking running ability on display, general manager Ryan Poles and head coach Matt Eberflus would like to see more consistency from Fields in the passing game.\n\nThe Bears are clearly in the team-building stage, and even if they make significant progress in the offseason, it would still be difficult for them to make the playoffs in the 2023 season.\n\nBut one thing the Bears do have is salary cap room and maneuverability. According to Spotrac, the Bears have $38 million more in cap room than any other team in the league. They have $98-million plus to spend before they hit their cap number. Presumably, that means they could go after a slew of talented free agents in addition to having the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nA team can never have too much cap space or financial maneuverability, and that means the Bears may still decide to cut a veteran or two.\n\nIt only makes sense. Why would Poles and Eberflus want to have any players remain on the roster whom they deem as unable to help the team next year? The main part of the job is adding quality players, and the secondary part is getting rid of poor ones. One of those players is Trevis Gipson\n\nDefensive lineman Trevis Gipson\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to look at Gipson and think that he will be part of a winning team once the Bears start to improve. He played in all 17 games in 2022 and he started 10 of them. The numbers that Gipson put together seem representative of a last-place team.\n\nGipson had 31 tackles, 4 tackles for loss and 3.0 sacks. He batted down 3 passes but he did not have a forced fumble, a fumble recovery or an interception.\n\nGipson, 6-4 and 263 pounds, can man the defensive end position and he has also played outside linebacker in his career. However, he does not dominate at either position and he is not showing upward mobility.\n\nHe regressed during the 2022 season when quite a bit was expected. Remember, the Bears did not have Khalil Mack or Robert Quinn, and Gipson was coming off a 2021 season in which he had 7.0 sacks. Instead of stepping up into a role of making big plays, Gipson was hard to find in crucial situations.\n\nGipson explained to the Chicago Sun-Times that the 2022 season was one of frustration.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating, but it\u2019s a bunch of things that are different this year,\u201d Gipson said. \u201cI\u2019d give you an answer, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m making excuses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just figured out there\u2019s a bunch of things I need to work on. Coming down the middle, I\u2019ve already missed about three sacks, and I\u2019m used to coming off the edge. So I\u2019ve got to work on my change of direction. Am I frustrated? A little bit. But I\u2019m not discouraged. I\u2019m still gonna keep fighting.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nGipson, 25, may still figure it out and become a more consistent and productive player. But the Bears are presumably going to have a much different look in 2023. It is going to be a challenge for the coaching staff to work in a likely boatload of new players. Do they really want to keep a player around who slipped badly last season?\n\nThe Bears can afford to spend money and improve. But they can\u2019t afford to waste time with players who have regressed.\n\nThey need to cut Trevis Gipson.",

            "text": "Similarities between Justin Fields, Jalen Hurts are tantalizing. So are the key differences.\n\nWith Super Bowl 57 set to kick off Sunday, many Bears fans are looking at Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and projecting what could be with Bears QB Justin Fields.\n\nThe two players are both tall, physical, athletic quarterbacks who are dangerous both with their arms and their legs. But the comparisons don't stop there. In many ways, Fields' journey and Hurts' journey have been quite similar.\n\nHere's several ways their careers have been similar, and several ways they are different:\n\nElite high school prospects\n\nBoth Fields and Hurts were top quarterback prospects, although Fields was considered a better high school prospect. Hurts, a Texas native, was the 192nd-ranked player overall in the class of 2016, according to the 247Sports composite ranking (which uses an algorithm to aggregate ratings from numerous recruiting sites). Fields, from Georgia, was the No. 2 ranked prospect in 2018, behind only Trevor Lawrence.\n\nHurts was a finalist for the Elite 11 QB camp, but did not make the final 11 in 2015. Fields, meanwhile, not only made the finals of Elite 11 but also won the MVP award for the showcase, beating out Lawrence.\n\nCollege transfers\n\nHurts became Alabama's starting QB as a true freshman in 2016. He led the Crimson Tide to the national title game, where they lost a heartbreaker against Deshaun Watson and Clemson. A year later, he guided Alabama back to the national championship game, but was benched at halftime in favor of Tua Tagovailoa. With Tagovailoa at QB, Alabama erased a 13-point deficit and won in overtime.\n\nHurts was then stuck behind Tagovailoa during the 2018 season and elected to transfer to Oklahoma in 2019. In his lone season with the Sooners, he guided them to a Big 12 title and a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nFields, meanwhile, was the No. 2 overall recruit in 2018, but found himself on the bench behind Jake Fromm as a true freshman at Georgia. He transferred to Ohio State and was granted a waiver to play immediately. He led the Buckeyes to back-to-back playoff appearances in 2019 and 2020, including a run to the championship game in 2020. Lawrence and Clemson knocked off Ohio State in the 2019 semifinals, only for Fields and the Buckeyes to exact revenge a year later in the 2020 semifinals.\n\nThe draft\n\nBoth QBs had reasons to feel slighted after the draft. In 2020, Hurts was the fifth QB off the board, taken by the Eagles in the second round (53rd overall). He went behind Joe Burrow (first overall), Tagovailoa (fifth) Justin Herbert (sixth) and Jordan Love (26th). Hurts could become the first among that group to win a Super Bowl. The move was a surprise because the Eagles had signed QB Carson Wentz to a four-year, $128 million contract extension less than a year earlier.\n\nFields led Ohio State to the national title game, yet still wound up being the fourth QB taken in the 2021 draft. Lawrence, Zach Wilson and Trey Lance went one, two, three at the top. Fields dropped to 11th, where the Bears traded up to select him. Prior to the draft, there were several questionable critiques featuring the same tired cliches that many Black quarterbacks face about his work ethic and his ability to understand the game.\n\nRough first seasons, followed by a rebound\n\nHurts began as the backup behind Wentz, but things got weird in Philly. The Eagles limped along to a 4-11-1 finish in 2020, and they benched Wentz in favor of Hurts for the final four games. Coach Doug Pederson was fired after the season.\n\nIn Chicago in 2021, Fields was stuck behind Andy Dalton. Coach Matt Nagy reluctantly moved to Fields, but only after Dalton suffered a knee injury. Fields started 10 games as a rookie, but the Bears struggled. Nagy, like Pederson, was fired after the season.\n\nHurts had a tremendous turnaround during his second season in 2021. He threw for 3,144 yards with 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions, leading the Eagles to a postseason appearance. Hurts rushed for 784 yards and 10 touchdowns in 15 starts.\n\nFields showed similar improvement during his sophomore season in 2022, although the Bears finished an ugly 3-14. Fields threw for 2,242 yards with 17 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He finished with 1,143 yards and eight touchdowns rushing, including plenty of magical runs along the way.\n\nProgression as passers\n\nSince Hurts became the starter, the Eagles acquired receiver DeVonta Smith with the 10th overall draft pick in 2021 and traded the 18th overall pick in 2022 to Tennessee for receiver A.J. Brown. Those weapons have reshaped the Eagles' offense. Hurts threw for 3,701 yards with 22 touchdowns and six interceptions this season. A year ago, he ranked 17th among QBs in passing DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average), which represents value per play -- think of it like football's version of baseball's WAR metric. This season, with a more efficient offense, Hurts improved to 10th.\n\nFields ranked dead last this season in DVOA among 34 NFL QBs with at least 200 passing attempts. There are several reasons why. Through the first month, the Bears passed at historically low levels. His supporting cast was lacking. Plus, Fields found it easier to pick up first downs running rather than throwing.\n\nBut that won't be the long-term game plan. Fields needs to take a major leap in efficiency passing if he wants to be where Hurts is this week -- playing in a Super Bowl. In the last 10 years, only two QBs ranked outside the top 15 in passing DVOA in a given year have led their team to a Super Bowl appearance. That was Joe Flacco in 2012 (who ranked 17th) and Peyton Manning in 2015 (ranked 36th). Nick Foles in 2017 did not have enough pass attempts to qualify.\n\nWhether Fields can make that jump is a big question heading into 2023.\n\nA key difference\n\nThere's one big area where these QBs are different: their teams. The Eagles drafted Hurts just two seasons removed from a Super Bowl title. They had been to the playoffs three straight years. They had a solid core already in place and general manager Howie Roseman hit all the right buttons to put the roster back in position to compete for a championship.\n\nThe Bears are in no position to make a Super Bowl run during Fields' third season. There's a lot of work that needs to be done with the roster before that conversation can begin. The good news, though, is that GM Ryan Poles has the proper assets to move in that direction with nine draft picks -- including the first overall pick -- and a league-leading amount of salary cap space.\n\nThe comparison between Hurts and Fields is fun, but the comparison between the organizations is where the similarities end. Hurts has had a lot of help to bring his team to the cusp of a championship. Fields will need a lot of help in 2023.",

    "tldr": "\n\nThe Chicago Bears are inching closer to the 2023 NFL Draft and should consider SMU standout receiver Rashee Rice in either the second or third round. Cynthia Frelund used computer simulations to determine that Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter is likely their best choice for the #1 pick due to his burst speed, run stopping ability and alignment versatility. Kevin Matthews, Jimmy Shorts and Kevin 'Butt-head' Butler have reunited on WGN Radio's Dave Plier show to discuss their Pig Skin Picks. Justin Fields' future with the team is uncertain as they may trade him for a first- and third-round pick, but logic suggests they will hold onto him given his success over two seasons. GM Ryan Poles will evaluate quarterbacks in this draft class as he would every year while Trevis Gipson needs to be cut due to regression during 2022 season with $98 million plus in cap room before hitting their cap number."
