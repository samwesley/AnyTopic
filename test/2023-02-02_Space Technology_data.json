Since then, the Iranian Space Agency has put planning for the use of space and the expansion of space technologies in the country using local knowledge and international cooperation on the agenda.\n\nThen, Iran was able to move towards launching satellites in addition to designing and building them by creating scientific infrastructures which were achieved by developing space launch terminals.\n\nIn addition to the development of space launch terminals, the development of satellite carriers has also been effective in achieving the country's cycle of designing and producing indigenous satellites.\n\nThe \u2018Safir\u2019 satellite carrier was designed and built in 2008 and the \u2018Simorgh\u2019 satellite carrier was in 2017. \u2018Sarir\u2019 and \u2018Soroush\u2019 satellite carriers also added to the space technology of the country.\n\nIran managed to launch several satellites with this equipment, some of which were successful and some of which were unsuccessful.\n\n\u2018Sina-1\u2019 was the first Iranian artificial satellite, launched at 6:52 UTC on October 28, 2005, on board a Cosmos-3M Russian launch vehicle from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Remote sensing, receiving, storing and sending telecommunication data were the two missions of this satellite.\n\nIran launched its first homemade satellite, \u2018Omid\u2019 (Hope), in 2009. After being launched by an Iranian-made carrier rocket, Safir 1, the satellite was placed into a low Earth orbit. Omid was a data-processing satellite for research and telecommunications. The launch, which coincided with the 30th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution was also verified by NASA the following day as a success. The launch of Omid made Iran the ninth country to develop an indigenous satellite launch capability.\n\n\u2018Rasad\u2019 (Observation) was another Iranian satellite which was launched in 2011. The third Iranian satellite, and the second to be launched successfully using an indigenous rocket, Rasad was Iran's first imaging satellite. Launched aboard a Safir-B carrier rocket, it was successfully placed into a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 236 by 299 kilometres (147 by 186 mi), inclined at 55.7 degrees. It made approximately fifteen orbits per day. The launch occurred at approximately 09:14 UTC on 15 June 2011 with the spacecraft reaching orbit several minutes later.\n\nThe satellite had a mass of 15.3 kilograms (34 lb) and returned images with a resolution of 150 metres (490 ft). It was equipped with solar panels to generate power. The satellite decayed from orbit three weeks after launch, on 6 July 2011.\n\n\u2018Navid\u2019 (Promise) was an experimental Iranian Earth observation satellite. As the third satellite launched indigenously by Iran, it carried a camera for taking higher-resolution imagery of Earth and it was also used to collect weather data and monitor natural disasters. The launch occurred at approximately 00:04 UTC on 3 February 2012. The satellite remained in orbit for two months, before reentering the atmosphere on 1 April 2012.\n\n\u2018Fajr\u2019 (Dawn) satellite was launched on 2 February 2015. It had a mass of 52 kg and was equipped with an optical imaging payload which would have reached a ground resolution of about 500 metres (1,600 ft). It was the first Iranian satellite to use a cold-gas thruster system to conduct orbital maneuvers and increase its service life by raising its orbit to prevent a fast decay. Fajr was launched by a Safir-1B rocket from the Iranian Space Agency's launch site in Semnan city. The satellite was deployed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of 224 km, an apogee of 470 km, an inclination of 55.53\u00b0, and an orbital period of 91.5 minutes.\n\n\u2018Payam\u2019 (Message) satellite was launched on 15 January 2019 with Simorgh satellite carrier but according to the announcement of then-Minister of Communications and Information Technology Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi the launch was not successful and the Payam satellite was not put into orbit. The rocket carrying the Payam satellite failed to reach the \u201cnecessary speed\u201d in the third stage of its launch. It was designed and developed by experts at the Amirkabir University of Technology to carry out imagery and telecommunication missions. It was aimed to orbit the Earth at an altitude of 500 kilometers to take surveying images at high resolutions.\n\n\u2018Dousti\u2019 (Friendship) satellite was the second Iranian satellite which faced an unsuccessful launch in 2017. It was a micro-class 52-kilogram satellite developed by experts from the Sharif University of Technology. It was a remote-sensing satellite, which was to orbit the Earth at an altitude of between 250 km and 310 km. The satellite was launched on a Safir-1B rocket in February 2019, but did not reach orbit.\n\n\u2018Zafar-1\u2019, was an imaging satellite launched in 2012 which didn't achieve the required speed to reach its orbit. It plummeted into the Indian Ocean after it failed to reach orbit.\n\nThe elite force of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) successfully launched the \u2018Noor-1\u2019 (Light) satellite by the domestically-built launcher Qassed (Messenger) on 22 April 2020 and placed it into orbit at an altitude of 425km. The launch of Noor-1 which is the Islamic Republic\u2019s first military satellite was carried out on the anniversary of the establishment of the IRGC.\n\n\u2018Noor-2\u2019, the second and only operational satellite of the Noor class, was launched on 8 March 2022 to a 500 kilometer orbit. The mission of the satellite is reconnaissance, and it was placed in orbit after 480 seconds at a speed of 6.7 km/s. Two Noor satellites have been launched from the Shahrud Desert in Iran.\n\nThe Iranian satellite \u2018Khayyam\u2019 was launched on a Soyuz-2.1b carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 9 August 2022. It is named after the Iranian polymath Omar Khayyam. Khayyam is a 600 kilograms (1,300 lb) satellite situated in an orbit 500 kilometres (310 mi) above the Earth's surface. Its main purpose is to collect information and images from the Earth's surface with a resolution of 1 metre (3.3 feet). It is designed to monitor and investigate the Earth's surface, both for government and civilian purposes.",

            "text": "Share Article\n\nAs the Defense Department engages commercial entities to speed innovation, cultural and structural differences between government and the private sector continue to be the biggest hurdle to rapidly deploying new technology, the head of Air Force Futures told the influential Defense Innovation Board at a recent meeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an access to innovation problem that we\u2019re dealing with, it\u2019s an innovation adoption problem,\u201d said Air Force Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration, and requirements, noting a number of barriers he\u2019s experienced in recent years. \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed each of these [barriers] stifle innovation on behalf of the bureaucracy and at the expense of tomorrow\u2019s warfighter.\u201d\n\nHinote made his remarks at the end of a two-day meeting of the new Defense Innovation Board. Chaired by Michael Bloomberg, the nine-member board includes academics, technology professionals, and other experts who advise DOD on emerging technology and innovation and how to promote military technological dominance. Among its members are former assistant secretary of the Air Force Will Roper and retired Adm. Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nPassionate but positive, Hinote urged the board to identify incentives throughout the acquisition world that can speed technology development in a culture rife with bureaucratic roadblocks.\n\nHe said he\u2019s witnessed leaders from three different administrations come in with a sense of urgency, only for that dynamic to not permeate through the bureaucracy. \u201cHaving the lack of sense of urgency in the middle is deadly, and that\u2019s what it has been for us,\u201d Hinote said.\n\nOne particular area Hinote focused on was risk timelines, noting that DOD\u2019s actions are based on near-term risks, in contrast to its stated focus. Hinote also said there is a strong tendency to focus on \u201cold ways\u201d instead of new ones.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of soft vetoes in our department \u2026 and at any one point, there are so many different people, offices, interests that can block an action,\u201d Hinote said. \u201cThey can\u2019t start an action; they can\u2019t initiate or get an action through, but they can block, and that\u2019s a fact of life in this department that makes it very difficult to keep going.\u201d\n\nHe added that there\u2019s also a strong \u201cnot-invented-here culture,\u201d where there can be competition between internal and external science and technology sectors. And while some competition between sectors can be good, Hinote added, it can be challenging when the timelines of a company differ from the government\u2019s budget timelines.\n\nIt\u2019s a particular issue with small startups whose fast-paced innovation might be perfect for DOD, but the startup must fund itself for multiple years until the budget process catches up with them. On top of that budget process, he added, is a lack of trust between the executive and legislative branches, particularly when looking at finding flexibility on how money is spent.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we\u2019re going to have to explore what types of transparency we need to get our congressional stakeholders semi-comfortable with the type of flexibility that we know we have to get to,\u201d Hinote said. \u201cAnd I think that involves a flexibility in intellectual property that we have not seen yet.\u201d\n\nIn challenging the board to map out incentives, he emphasized the need to tap more into intellectual property and use it to scale.\n\nFor example, Hinote suggested that in critical times of need, if U.S. forces have good technology and an ally has good manufacturing capability, \u201cit is in the national interest to release the intellectual property, give it to the partner and let them build the weapons, because at the moment, we are not able to build enough weapons fast enough,\u201d he said.\n\nUltimately, Hinote said, the conversation must change, because oftentimes there\u2019s little incentive to push technology boundaries, increase the speed of a bureaucratic process, or take risks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this is impossible; I don\u2019t believe that people want to watch innovation flounder in our department,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the incentives are structured in a way that makes it darn impossible, and until we call it out, I just don\u2019t see how it gets better.\u201d\n\nIn another brief to the board, Jason Rathje, director of the Office of Strategic Capital and co-founder and former director of AFWERX\u2019s AFVentures division, insisted the government must do more to increase capital access for innovators.\n\nWith so many American companies investing and developing capabilities in science and technology, boosted by cooperation with academia, there has been world-class advancement in critical areas, Rathje said. But there needs to be a next step\u2014to provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to have their technologies support national security goals.\n\nRathje added that OSC is looking at two new strategies to promote private investment as a national security tool: syndication and leverage.\n\n\u201cSyndication is a strategy that simply partners with private capital providers to co-invest in new technology efforts to help scale the business is we help scale the technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat leverage does is it lowers the cost of capital; private investors can make patient capital investments that are required, at the sizes that they\u2019re required to invest, in deep technology companies.\u201d\n\nRathje also celebrated the OSC\u2019s partnership with the Small Business Administration and working with the Small Business Investment Company program. SBIC provides investment opportunities to technology companies in their early stages by leveraging the Federal Credit Program.\n\n\u201cThe way these investment funds work is that we can license new limited partnerships that are vertically focused on deep technology areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can provide two dollars of leverage, two dollars of debt, for every dollar of private capital that is raised.\u201d\n\nThe SBIC initiative began in December, and Rathje said they hope to begin receiving applications for the initiative by mid-year. In addition, OCS will soon publish its inaugural investment strategy, which will review critical technology sectors and provide assessments regarding capital availability.",

            "text": "The computer research institute established in 1972 was building the internet on the Westside decades before the tech industry took over.\n\nFrom Dogtown and Z-boys to Silicon Beach, the Westside of Los Angeles\u2019s mix of media, entrepreneurship and technology has shaped the city\u2019s culture and economy alike. Its tech hub, Silicon Beach, is no exception, transforming from a small string of promising companies to a global tech powerhouse.\n\nBut who was here first? USC\u2019s Information Sciences Institute (ISI) is the indubitable answer. Established in 1972 in the newly built Marina Towers in Marina Del Rey \u2013 the first employees moved in when some floors of the building did not have exterior walls yet! \u2013 ISI was created to help build the Arpanet, the ancestor of the internet.\n\nAt the time they leased the 12th and last floor of the building and are now the main tenant of the South Tower (only 3 floors to go!). Today, their computers still have the best view overlooking the Pacific Ocean, but the tech scene on land looks quite different.\n\nEven USC has expanded in the area since ISI was established, with the creation of the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) in 1999, a University Affiliated Research Center originally funded by the US Army.\n\nWhile the San Francisco tech space is perhaps most identifiable by the iconic Apple logo, Los Angeles, true to its eclectic character, boasts a not-so-subtle bright yellow emblem with a ghost: Snap, former Snapchat, one of the main success stories of the area.\n\nSpanning from Santa Monica to Playa Vista, Silicon Beach is now home to over 500 technology companies, the likes of which include tech titans such as Google, YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, TikTok, Hulu, and Postmates. Multi-billion-dollar acquisitions like Honey and Oculus have cemented Silicon Beach as a major player in the global tech industry, a far cry from the region\u2019s origins.\n\nGoogle has been a harbinger of Silicon Beach\u2019s growth. It established its first LA office in Santa Monica in 2003, subsequently attracting other tech companies to the area. It then launched its new Venice campus in 2011 \u2014 three adjacent buildings, including the Frank Gehry-designed Binoculars Building, with 100,000 square feet of office space. In 2018, Google expanded in a repurposed 1940s hangar office building, the former Spruce Goose hangar, in adjacent Playa Vista.\n\nOnce again, smaller companies followed suit and now possess sprawling campuses with stunning architecture, like Amazon\u2019s ongoing 620 million expansion in Culver City. Facebook and YouTube are in Playa Vista, and Hulu and Twitter in Santa Monica, with Venice still at the heart of the region.\n\nThis expansion was a natural one, as explained by Daniel Lee, Culver City\u2019s mayor, \u201cConsider Sony, which has been in Culver City for 20 years. A lot of the other smaller companies that complement movie production came here because Sony is in proximity, so they can work together and exchange information, either on the same network or physically.\u201d He elaborated, \u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of active outreaches to get the specifically large companies here. To some degree, some of the newer media companies like TikTok \u2013 also established in Culver City \u2013 want to be closer to older media to be taken seriously sooner.\u201d\n\nSanta Monica has also seen major growth and diversification in their technology sector over the past decade. As of 2022, 3,166 businesses operate in this industry in Santa Monica, employing 29,000 employees, 37% of the city\u2019s workforce (and 63% of its quarterly payroll!), and generating roughly 2 billion dollars in quarterly payroll. Snap \u2013 who started in nearby Venice \u2013 is now headquartered in Santa Monica and the largest private employer in the city at about 2,200 employees.\n\nJennifer Taylor, Santa Monica\u2019s Economic Development Manager, explained the expansion of Silicon Beach in recent years: \u201cWe have a lot of traditional L.A.-type industries that had a long-term presence in Santa Monica, but we have seen evolution with tech companies in the last four or five years, with crossovers between disciplines: tech confluence with healthcare businesses, fintech businesses, and a lot of tech businesses mixed with another industry.\u201d\n\nThe video gaming industry, the perfect mix of tech and entertainment talents, is very robust in Santa Monica, led by Activision Blizzard \u2013 Candy Crush, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Guitar Hero \u2013 headquartered in the city since 2008.\n\nGoodRx, another crossover company, marries tech with healthcare to provide affordable prescriptions to consumers across the globe.\n\nSanta Monica is particularly attractive to companies given its proximity to \u200b\u200binvestment opportunities: the city\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit attracts millions of dollars in funding, with venture investment rising to $7.8 billion in 2020, an ideal environment to foster technological innovation.\n\nTaylor elaborated: \u201cWe asked why companies choose to move to Santa Monica, and they said because of the quality of life and the proximity to highly skilled workers. They also cited the ecosystem where employers have access to venture capital that is right here. We have heard that repeatedly from businesses.\u201d The Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce has taken an active role in recruiting new companies, convincing industry leaders and commercial brokers to join the growing tech and creative sector.\n\nSilicon Beach\u2019s maturing economy has led to various projects and initiatives to make the life of tech employees easier. Culver City installed protected bus and bike lanes to improve accessibility to and between many tech companies, and their clean power lines have helped meet the demands of green initiatives launched by companies like Amazon and Apple.\n\nOther industries have capitalized on Silicon Beach\u2019s growth: global law firm Goodwin established a Santa Monica practice in 2019 focused on private equity and technology, adding several early-stage technology partners to their group in June 2022. Real estate has also seen sustained growth in the area in response to strong buyer demand from tech employees seeking homes near their offices.\n\nSo, can anything stop Silicon Beach\u2019s expansion?\n\nYes, unfortunately. The region is limited by its land. Santa Monica is a small city, only 16 square miles, and the local construction code prevents building more than 6 stories without a special permit. Successful companies tend to migrate South \u2013 expanding Silicon Beach\u2019s limits \u2013 in areas away from the beaten path. This happened to Ring, the video doorbell camera company, who started in Santa Monica, got acquired by Amazon, and recently built a campus in Hawthorne near SpaceX, a 35 minute drive on the busy 405 highway \u2013 on a good day \u2013 from its mothership.\n\n\u201cSpace is our biggest challenge to retaining businesses, admitted Taylor. Some companies start to incubate here and need to leave. We are just glad that they can stay in the region because it benefits everyone, even if it is not in the city limits. It is an opportunity for workforce development, venture capital, and investment.\u201d\n\nSilicon Beach pioneer USC ISI also has plans for expansion, with the goal of doubling its workforce in the next 5 years \u2013 all while staying in their Marina Del Rey headquarters \u2013 and to be an active player in the growth and expansion of this Southern California tech hub.\n\nPublished on February 1st, 2023",

            "text": "As a prototype prepares for tests in orbit, Nature looks at five of the biggest challenges for space-based solar power.\n\nThe European Space Agency is investigating whether orbiting solar arrays could beam renewable energy to Earth, as shown in this artist\u2019s illustration.Credit: European SPS Tower concept\n\nFor 100 years, people have dreamed of sending vast arrays of solar panels into space and beaming their energy down to Earth. Unlike intermittent renewable-energy sources on the ground, these orbiting panels would always bask in bright sunlight and would potentially offer a continuous supply of power.\n\nNow such schemes are beginning to look possible, thanks to cheaper hardware and the falling cost of space launches. Teams around the world are working on key parts of space-based solar-power systems, and a prototype built by researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) should begin experiments in orbit this month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing outlandish in this that would require new physics,\u201d says James Carpenter, who co-leads the Solaris initiative, a feasibility study undertaken by the European Space Agency (ESA) that could lead to full development of the technology from 2025. \u201cEconomically, it\u2019s comparable, for example, with nuclear power,\u201d says Carpenter, who is based at ESA\u2019s European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.\n\nSpace-based solar power would be viable only if it were implemented on a massive scale. Scientists anticipate building kilometres-wide arrays of solar panels that would orbit Earth at a distance of around 36,000 kilometres. The energy that they harvest would be converted to microwaves and beamed down to surface-based receivers with even larger physical footprints.\n\nChina has announced plans to put a megawatt-scale demonstration unit in low-Earth orbit in 2028, before deploying another system to a more distant geosynchronous orbit in 2030. Carpenter says that, with sufficient funding, the first multigigawatt solar power station could be operational by 2040. But despite the excitement, huge technical hurdles remain.\n\nNature looks at five big questions that researchers must answer to make space-based solar power a reality.\n\nHow can a solar farm be built in space?\n\nTo generate a gigawatt of power \u2014 comparable to the output of a power station on Earth \u2014 the orbiting arrays would need to be more than one square kilometre in size. That\u2019s more than 100 times the size of the International Space Station, which took a decade to build. An array would be assembled in space from modules that could be mass-produced and launched separately. Caltech\u2019s experiment will involve unfurling a tightly folded structure into a solar panel platform roughly the size of a dining table, but the modules in a full-sized array could be up to 60 metres long.\n\nOther projects use different designs. Among the proposals ESA\u2019s Solaris initiative is considering is a helical structure, and in Xi'an, China, Xidian University\u2019s Chasing the Sun project is developing a crown-shaped solar collector. Both would require remote assembly by robots in orbit, a still-nascent technology.\n\nThe engineering behind such systems is \u201cincredibly complex\u201d, says Karen Jones, a space economist at the Aerospace Corporation in Arlington, Virginia. Caltech hopes to side-step this problem by flying its flexible panels in formation, without tethering them together, and using algorithms to correct for any fluctuations in position that affect power transmission. Whichever design is used, the components would need to be launched weekly, a rate that would be unprecedented, says Jovana Radulovic, a chemical engineer at the University of Portsmouth, UK.\n\nWhat kind of solar cells would be used?\n\nThe solar cells need to be lightweight and efficient to keep launch costs down. Each kilogram of panel should produce 1\u20132 kilowatts of power, says David Homfray, a physicist who leads technical work at the UK\u2019s public\u2013private Space Energy Initiative. That power-to-weight ratio is around 50 times greater than for conventional silicon cells on Earth. Most designs aim to boost the solar cells' exposure to sunlight using concentrators, mirrors and other innovative structures.\n\nThe cells will also need to withstand intense radiation in space. Yet the robust solar photovoltaic materials used in many space probes are too expensive to deploy in a huge array, so researchers need to know how cheaper alternatives will perform, says Radulovic.\n\nTo that end, an experiment on the Caltech prototype will trial 32 lightweight photovoltaic cells, including low-cost perovskites. \u201cThe idea here is to kind of do a longevity test,\u201d says Ali Hajimiri, who co-leads the Caltech project.\n\nCaltech researchers have built a prototype space-based solar power system that launched in January and is now preparing for tests in orbit.Credit: Caltech/Space Solar Power Project\n\nHow will the solar power reach Earth?\n\nThis is arguably the biggest challenge. Although laser beams transfer energy efficiently, clouds can block them. To avoid this problem, researchers hope to convert the solar arrays\u2019 electricity into microwaves, which pass through the atmosphere without losing much energy. However, microwaves spread out as they travel, so engineers will need to carefully synchronize how the waves are emitted and use kilometres-wide receiving stations to collect them.\n\nConverting solar energy into electricity, then into microwaves, and back into electricity on the ground, will inevitably incur some losses. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to consider this idea seriously until those losses are significantly reduced,\u201d says Radulovic. ESA estimates that only 10\u201315% of the solar power falling on a space array needs to be delivered to the electricity grid for a system to be economically viable. Yet achieving that would still require considerable advances in several energy-conversion technologies, the agency says.\n\nLast year, researchers at Xidian University used microwaves to transmit solar power over 55 metres in a small-scale experiment on Earth. Using only conventional silicon cells, it achieved an overall efficiency of around 2.4%; the test marked the first time that the entire sequence had been demonstrated in a single system, says Xun Li, a researcher on the project. Caltech\u2019s prototype will be the first space-based experiment to use microwaves to transmit and receive power, albeit across only 30 centimetres, adds Hajimiri.\n\nWill it all be worth the effort?\n\nSpace agencies and nations think that space-based solar power might contribute to the goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But \u201cwe have to prove this is going to actually be a net gain for the planet\u201d, says Jones.\n\nSpace-based solar would certainly be much more expensive than terrestrial solar power. However, it could rival the costs of other sources of continuous low-carbon power, such as nuclear or gas with carbon-capture technology, says Carpenter \u2014 although more-economical ways of storing renewable electricity on the ground could diminish the case for a space array.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at the University of Strathclyde, UK, have calculated that it would take less than six years for a space-based solar-power station to offset the greenhouse gases emitted by developing, building and installing the project. \u201cIt looks really, really competitive,\u201d says Homfray. Still, Radulovic questions the reliability of such estimates, given the uncertainties about how these systems will be designed and deployed.\n\nWill it be safe?\n\nBeaming microwave energy from space is surprisingly safe. The beam\u2019s frequency will be chosen so that it does not disrupt aircraft communication. And because its power would be spread over such a wide area, the average energy density received by ground stations would be around 50 watts per square metre, says Carpenter, equivalent to the harmless level of microwaves that can leak from a microwave oven. \u201cIt\u2019s within what would be considered a normal safety recommendation for human exposure,\u201d he says.\n\nBut researchers will need to prove that there are no adverse effects on humans, animals or the wider environment. \u201cI think they need to take the lead from the mobile-wireless industry that went through the same concerns, and to not trivialize these concerns, but prove it with studies,\u201d says Jones.",

            "text": "BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - Researchers at Western Kentucky University have partnered with Adelphi Technology, a company based in California, to create a portable electronic \u201csniffer\u201d to accurately detect gases in the air.\n\nBoth groups say that the device has a wide array of uses, ranging from agricultural innovation to bomb detection.\n\nThe researchers say that the idea began with the concept of bug detection, a procedure that scans a sealed container with high energy particles to find out what is inside the container without opening it. From this, researchers say they asked the question, \u201cCan we chemically sniff the possible threats and identify a molecular signature in the air?\u201d\n\nThe current prototype for the device was made possible from a recent Kentucky Small Business Innovation Grant, which makes the device applicable to agricultural purposes.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019ve had interest from USDA and NOAA for food safety, because they\u2019re sniffing, you know, when there\u2019s contaminants in the food, and possibly doing some farm monitoring.\u201d said Dr. Charles Gary, CEO of Adelphi Technology.\n\nThe technology behind the device does currently exist, but takes time, resources, and a full chemical lab to access. The researchers hope that by making the device portable, anybody can accurately assess air quality around them and be notified of possible contaminants.\n\nWith the focus currently on agriculture, the developers behind the research say that the current Kentucky project is part of a project in partnership with NASA, which focuses on growing fresh vegetables in space.\n\n\u201cObviously moon and mars exploration is a big thing, but their biggest goal is providing astronauts with fresh fruits and vegetables in space, and in addition to that, produce oxygen in space,\u201d said one researcher on the project. \u201cThey want to create an ecosystem that is really close to our normal environment.\u201d\n\nThe researchers say that before they are able to test the product in space, they must ensure that it does its desired job on earth, assisting in food safety.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working with people working in meat processing, poultry processing plants testing prototypes over a two-year program and kind of funding the program, and I would expect at the end of that we\u2019ll have a product for food safety.\u201d said Gary.\n\nWhile the researchers say the electronic sniffer has many applications that are yet to be found, they are rapidly approaching the device\u2019s commercial availability, predicting that the first models for food safety could be ready by the end of 2023.\n\nCopyright 2023 WBKO.

It will mark the first deployment in Canada of Fleet Space\u2019s satellite-based mineral exploration system. This system aims to enable faster, more environmentally-friendly exploration for high-grade nickel deposits at Power Nickel\u2019s flagship NISK project in Quebec. New nickel deposits are required to reduce Canada\u2019s dependence on imported minerals in nickel battery production for electric vehicles and wider transition to clean energy.\n\nPower Nickel, which specializes in exploring high-potential nickel, copper, gold, and other battery metal prospects in Canada and Chile, will use Fleet Space\u2019s ExoSphere technology to seek nickel ore deposits at its NISK site in Quebec. ExoSphere consists of sensors called Geodes, which uses ambient noise tomography (ANT) to collect subsurface data. This data is beamed to the ExoSphere constellation of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, then relayed to computers that use machine learning to generate detailed 3D subsurface maps. The combination of Geodes and satellite connectivity allows small teams to map vast amounts of land accurately and with little to no environmental disturbance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to see ExoSphere deployed in Canada for the first time, building on our success in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. As well as great technology and commercial partnership, this is a real meeting of minds. We both understand the urgent need to accelerate the discovery process for these vital minerals; but we\u2019re also equally committed to minimising its environmental impact.

            "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two months into its establishment, the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) is looking at ways to increase capital flows and market participation in deep technology areas \u2014 things like artificial intelligence, biotech and quantum computing \u2014 and is developing its first investment strategy, the office\u2019s director said today.\n\n\u201cHow do we give these technology entrepreneurs the opportunity to take their [science and technology] into products and services that not only support the national security mission but also larger economic prosperity?\u201d said Jason Rathje, who was a guest speaker at a meeting today of the Defense Innovation Board. \u201cWell, the Office of Strategic Capital is investigating two new strategies to help align and scale private investment to support national security.\u201d\n\nThose two strategies are syndication, in which the government \u201csimply partners with private capital providers to co-invest in new technology efforts to help scale the business as we help scale the technology,\u201d Rathje said, and a \u201cmore novel strategy\u201d for DoD: leverage.\n\n\u201cLeverage works to change the economics on investments in deep technology areas,\u201d Rathje said. \u201cFundamentally what leverage does is it lowers the cost of capital, private investors to make the patient capital investments that are required at the sizes that they\u2019re required to invest in deep technology companies.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon established the OSC last December in an effort to help bridge the \u201cvalley of death,\u201d where innovative technologies fail to shift into actual programs of record, by developing and implementing \u201cproven partnered strategies to shape and scale investment in critical technologies,\u201d DoD said in a memo. While the OSC and Defense Innovation Board are two separate entities, they share a similar focus on leveraging private industry for advancing innovation within the department.\n\n\n\n\u201cOSC was fundamentally established to give the Department of Defense a new tool in our current competition because today the United States\u2026is in a global competition to be a world leader in emerging and critical technologies,\u201d Rathje said. \u201cTechnology areas such as semiconductors, advanced materials and biotech are just as critical as those defense technologies that we consider \u2014 such as hypersonics and directed energy \u2014 these are technology areas are ones that we spend billions of dollars of [science and technology] funding\u2026 winning this race is truly vital to national security and economic prosperity.\u201d\n\nIn December the office launched its first program activity, the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) critical technologies initiative through the office\u2019s partnership with the Small Business Administration. The SBIC program has already helped create new investment opportunities in early stage deep technology companies, Rathje said.\n\n\u201cNow the way this program works is it leverages what is called the Federal Credit Program\u2026 where other departments and agencies utilize government loans and loan guarantees to increase leveraging technology areas and societal sectors that we think are important to increase investment in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe OSC will start taking applications for the SBIC initiative by this summer and wants to \u201clicense our first funds\u201d for the program this year, Rathje added. The office also plans to publish its first investment strategy, which will assess critical technology areas for \u201ccapital availability as well as liquidity opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what this does is it really helps us to tip and cue these tools to invest in the areas of these technology sectors that most require this source of capital,\u201d he said.",
