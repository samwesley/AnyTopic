            "text": "STOCKBRIDGE \u2014 A few dozen Stockbridge High School students have their heads tuned to the clouds, miles from Earth.\n\nThey'll be shooting off high-powered rockets and launching their own satellite toward the skies this year.\n\n\"This is opening a lot of doors for the future,\" said Jason Gruber, a 17-year-old junior.\n\nA project he's leading \u2212 shooting a large model rocket to 800 feet into the air and landing safe with an egg, a valuable payload these days \u2212 could help him and other students forge aerospace careers.\n\nAnd that's just a fraction of the height these students plan to reach this year with a satellite they helped to program and build. They expect to send a CubeSat \u2212 a 3.9-inch square, palm-sized miniature satellite \u2212 into a suborbital launch some time this year. A date remains undetermined.\n\n\"I would like to possibly go to space or send something into space,\" Gruber said.\n\nCubeSat should reach more than 300,000 feet into the air, not quite outer space, said Jack Hammerberg, an 18-year-old senior leading the satellite project after years with the class.\n\nBob Richards, teacher of The Special Projects Lab, is optimistic, saying the satellite should dance on the edge of space, about 65 miles from the ground at its peak.\n\nThe class has booked a slot on a private space flight from bluShift Aerospace in Maine, and their satellite will be joined by many others, largely from universities and companies. Some CubeSats can collect and transmit data for up to a quarter of a century until they are shut off or struck by other debris.\n\n\"What got me interested is, as high school students, we could actually launch something into space and take pictures and document the whole process,\" Hammerberg said, explaining why he became more ambitious. \"In my mind, that was meant for universities and big companies.\"\n\nThere are likely only a handful of high schools in the country where students get to work with real satellites, he said.\n\nYounger Stockbridge students, including some middle school students, are experimenting with a slightly simpler version of the satellite, minus the camera and with some wood instead of metal parts.\n\nFor more than a decade, students have opted into a special lab at Stockbridge Junior/Senior High School where they can suggest and build technology.\n\nThey've built a two-person bike capable of riding on the moon and have simulated growing plants in space similar to NASA's International Space Station.\n\nThe team, changing every year as students graduate and new ones join, has been featured on \"60 Minutes\" and plenty of other news profiles for more than a decade. Often their big project involves underwater robots that explore WWII remains on the island nation of Palau, the site of a fierce World War II battle between American and Japanese forces in 1944.\n\nRichards said his class gives students a chance to do advanced work and see themselves in a variety of careers, from farming to aerospace engineering. The workspace for students includes automated machines, 3D printers, pipes and wires, electronics, computers and the freedom to explore ideas. It is modeled after the Coastal Observing Research and Development Center at the University of South California-San Diego, which has worked with the class on many of their underwater expeditions.\n\nThe class, in late 2022, flew out to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a convention about small satellites. They were on the inaugural flight to Orlando out of the Capital Region International Airport in Lansing. On board, along with many of the students, was a version of the CubeSat they plan to launch.\n\nWhile there in Florida, Gruber saw another school was using rockets to help test satellite components and learned about a national competition to hit 800 feet with an egg intact.\n\n\"They had a high-powered rocket. I said I'd love to build a rocket. They gave me advice and told me about a book,\" he said. \"I told Mr. Richards I\u2019d love to build a rocket.\n\n\"He told me to do research, build a team and you can go do it.\"\n\nContact Mike Ellis at mellis@lsj.com or on Twitter @MikeEllis_AIM",

            "text": "Duke Housing and Residence Life has converted a gaming suite in Edens Quad, formerly known as the Bolt, into the Hangar, an \u201cactive research lab\u201d connected with the Duke Marine Laboratory\u2019s Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Laboratory, according to a Monday email sent to Edens residents and obtained by The Chronicle.\n\nDean for Residence Life Deb LoBiondo emailed residents a letter from David Johnston, professor of the practice of marine conservation ecology and director of the MaRRS. The MaRRS focuses on using drones and remote sensing technology to study marine spaces and species, according to the laboratory\u2019s website.\n\nThe space, located in Edens 1C, is used to support the Fouling Community, an LLC created in 2022 with the mission of \u201c[providing] a space for Marine Lab scholars to bridge their experience between the DUML and Durham.\u201d The Hangar is also used to provide a space for the LLC\u2019s house course, per the email. Before the Hangar, the LLC common room also served as a \u201cmeeting space for marine science-related student groups.\u201d\n\nThe Hangar is currently restricted to those working at the laboratory or a part of the LLC\u2019s house course to ensure the safety of its specialized equipment and \u201cprovide the appropriate atmosphere for students, staff and faculty that are using the space,\u201d according to the email.\n\nThe Bolt, opened in 2015, previously offered a gaming space for students, with eight monitors, 10 gaming computers, game consoles and a four screen arrangement that totaled over 100 inches. It was meant to \u201cappeal to potential incoming students in a tech-savvy generation ... [and] provide a social outlet for students to get them out of their rooms and into the common areas,\" said Rick Johnson, associate vice president of Student Affairs at the time.\n\nLoBiondo did not respond to The Chronicle's request for information on whether HRL has plans to move the Bolt to a different location.\n\nSome students who live in Edens and utilized the Bolt expressed frustrations with losing access to the common space.\n\nSophomore Benjamin Koch, a resident of Edens Quad, said that he and his friends spent time together in the Bolt multiple times a week. He said that many students in Edens liked to use the space to hang out.\n\n\u201cIt was our go-to space to form a community and meet new people. And like now that the space is gone, we're scrambling, we're a little devastated as a community,\u201d Koch said. Despite the email from LoBiondo being sent out Feb. 6, Koch estimated that the Bolt was changed into the Hangar about two weeks ago and said he had seen some construction happen. \u201cThey changed it and then they told us after the fact,\u201d he said. Similar to Koch, junior Josh Jacobs found out about the change through the email.\n\n\u201cThey basically said, \u2018All the entrances are locked except one, which we can't get locked yet, so don't go in there.\u2019 There's a note [on the door] that says don't go in,\u201d Jacobs said.\n\nJacobs, who lived in Edens 1C last year, said he had used the Bolt often last year. He said there were always students who hooked their gaming consoles up to the TVs in the room and played Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros, as well as card games.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in Edens, which already is the least-desired dorm, you have to take what you can get,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cYou have to take advantage of the fact that you're close to Pitchforks, or that you have the Bolt. And now they just took [the Bolt] away.\u201d\n\nHe said that while he individually didn\u2019t meet new people at the space, the Bolt was just a different setting from a common room for him to hang out, play games and relax with friends.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there's really no good reason for [the Hangar] to be there. Like, there's plenty of classrooms,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThey're just picking on Edens.\u201d\n\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox Signup for our weekly newsletter.

            "text": "Update, 4:45 pm ET: Well, they did it.\n\nAt around 3:15 pm local time in South Texas, SpaceX ignited its Super Heavy rocket for a \"full duration\" test of its Raptor engines. According to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the launch team turned off one engine just prior to ignition, and another stopped itself. Still, he said 31 of 33 engines would have provided enough thrust to reach orbit. This is a huge milestone for SpaceX that potentially puts the company on track for an orbital test flight during the second half of March or possibly early April.\n\nThis is the most engines ignited on a rocket ever. The thrust output of these engines, too, was likely nearly double that of NASA's Saturn 5 rocket or Space Launch System. The good news for SpaceX is that, at least from early views, the launch infrastructure in South Texas looked mostly unscathed.\n\nOriginal post: After years of preparatory work, SpaceX plans to ignite all 33 of the main engines on its massive Super Heavy rocket booster today. This is the first stage of the company's Starship rocket, which is intended to be fully reusable, to help power NASA's return to the Moon and one day possibly help humans settle on Mars.\n\nNo rocket has ever used so many engines before. The closest comparison is the Soviet Union's N1 rocket, which had a first stage powered by 30 NK-15 liquid-fueled engines. However, each of these engines was only about two-thirds as powerful as the Raptor 2 rocket engines bolted to the Super Heavy rocket.\n\nAnd, oh yeah, the N1 was a massive failure. Intended to compete with NASA's Saturn V rocket and form the backbone of a Soviet Moon program, the N1 rocket attempted four launches from 1969 to 1972. All were busts, including one\u2014the second launch, just two weeks before the Apollo 11 Moon landing in July 1969\u2014that destroyed its launch complex as the rocket failed shortly after liftoff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch is the history before SpaceX today as it tests the Super Heavy booster by igniting all its Raptor engines for a few seconds, with the rocket held firmly to the ground.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday at a commercial space conference in Washington, DC, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said Thursday would be a \"big day\" for the company. \"Keep in mind, this first one is really a test flight,\" said Shotwell, who knows her spaceflight history. \"The real goal is to not blow up the launch pad, that is success.\"\n\nIn truth, after a rapid-fire test campaign in 2020 and 2021 of Starship prototypes, the company has moved more cautiously at its development and test facility in South Texas, known as Starbase. This is because the company has likely invested more than $1 billion in a massive launch-and-catch tower to support Starship and Super Heavy, as well as ground systems to support fueling of the massive vehicles.\n\nBecause so many assets are clustered in a small area near the Gulf of Mexico, SpaceX really does not want to take the risk of destroying infrastructure it has spent more than a year building and testing. This would set the Starship launch campaign back months, at least, as the area is rebuilt. It would also probably redouble regulatory concerns that were raised as part of the Federal Aviation Administration's process to clear the South Texas location for experimental orbital launches.\n\nSo Shotwell is correct when she says the main goal today is to not blow up the launch pad. After that, SpaceX will work to glean data about the performance of the Raptor engines on the rocket and replace those that show deviations from expected behavior.\n\nIf this test goes reasonably well, it would put SpaceX on a path toward its first orbital launch attempt, now likely to occur no earlier than the second half of March or perhaps in April.\n\nThere is no set time for today's test. The road closure for the Boca Chica area runs from 8 am CT (14:00 UTC) to 8 pm CT (02:00 UTC Friday) local time. It is also not known whether SpaceX will broadcast the test. However, there are several streamers (such as NASASpaceflight and LabPadre) expected to provide uninterrupted coverage of whatever happens on the launch pad.",

Unlike the general surgery robotics market \u2014 which is dominated by only one company, Intuitive Surgical \u2014 all major orthopedic manufacturers are competing in the orthopedic robotics market,\u201d Tina Deng, principal medical devices analyst at GlobalData, said in a news release posted Feb. 1.\n\nIn addition, Global Data noted that the pandemic has accelerated the shift of procedures to outpatient or ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nPositive news coming out of the orthopedic devices space\n\nRecent orthopedic device industry news on MassDevice appears to back up the GlobalData report.\n\nFor example, orthopedic device giant Stryker is starting the year with good momentum. Plus, it plans new application launches in 2024 for its popular Mako robotic surgery system.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter was almost back to normal,\u201d CEO Kevin Lobo told Fox Business in a recent interview. He predicted a tailwind for the next couple of years.\n\nLobo acknowledged that high electronics costs had affected its capital equipment business. But he told Fox Business that Stryker has started a years-long process of raising prices and cutting costs to restore margins to 2019 levels.\n\nIn 2021, Stryker acquired Gauss Surgical and its Triton artificial intelligence-enabled platform for the real-time monitoring of blood loss during surgery. Gauss Surgical founder Siddarth Satish is now leading a Stryker AI initiative inside the company\u2019s Digital, Robotics, and Enabling Technologies business, Lobo said.\n\nIn other orthopedic device company news, Zimmer Biomet is looking to achieve attractive growth after a Street-beating fourth quarter. Meanwhile, smaller companies are combining. Orthofix and SeaSpine completed a merger last month, and Globus Medical and NuVasive announced plans for a combination today.",

            "text": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured an image of an asteroid that's approximately the size of Rome's Colosseum.\n\n2\n\nAn illustration of the asteroid that's between 300 to 650 feet in length\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nAn international team of European astronomers has used Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to detect an interloping asteroid that's estimated to be anywhere between 300 and 650 feet wide, or approximately the size of Rome's Colosseum. While that may sound like a large asteroid, NASA writes that this object is likely the smallest object Webb has observed so far and could be a great example of an object that measures under 0.6 miles that resides within the main asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter.\n\nWebb's observations of the asteroid were published in the scientific journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, where it's explained that the asteroid was detected while Webb was performing calibration testing for its MIRI instrument. Researchers pointed the MIRI instrument at the main belt asteroid 1998 BC1 and began taking calibration images. According to NASA, these tests failed for technical reasons such as brightness and the telescope not being pointed at the right target.\n\n\"We - completely unexpectedly - detected a small asteroid in publicly available MIRI calibration observations. The measurements are some of the first MIRI measurements targeting the ecliptic plane, and our work suggests that many new objects will be detected with this instrument,\" explained Thomas Muller, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany.\n\nDespite the failure of calibration, NASA was able to capture data on the small asteroid, with NASA writing that these findings demonstrate that even \"failed\" Webb observations can yield interesting results. It should be noted that MIRI data on the asteroid was combined with data acquired by the ESA's Gaia mission as well as ground-based telescopes.\n\nFurthermore, NASA writes that Webb's accidental observations of the asteroid show that Webb will be able to contribute to the detection of new asteroids while also observing other targets. As for the asteroid itself, NASA writes in its blog post that its discovery will have important implications for the current models humans have of the solar system and how asteroids play an important role in its evolution.\n\n\"Our results show that even 'failed' Webb observations can be scientifically useful, if you have the right mindset and a little bit of luck. Our detection lies in the main asteroid belt, but Webb's incredible sensitivity made it possible to see this roughly 100-meter object at a distance of more than 100 million kilometers,\" elaborated Muller.\n\nSince Webb has detected an asteroid that is quite small when compared to other asteroids floating around in the cosmos, NASA believes that Webb's observations will now allow astronomers to study asteroids that have a diameter smaller than 1 kilometer in size, allowing for more information to be gathered on small asteroids that have otherwise had sparing research conducted on them.\n\nNASA writes that follow-up observations on the asteroid are needed to confirm its specifics, such as its true diameter, its position, and its orbit. According to the space agency, these follow-up observations are currently being scheduled.\n\nFor more information on this story, check out the following link here.",

            "text": "Bioinspired underwater robots that can change their shapes dynamically push through the water much more efficiently than their conventional rigid counterparts. But they\u2019re quite difficult to build.\n\nNow, an MIT research team has come up with an innovative approach to creating deformable underwater robots. The modular system can be used to build robots of varying shapes and sizes with both hard and soft elements.\n\nThe deformable robots are made with lattice-like pieces, called voxels, that are low density and have high stiffness. The individual voxels are mostly hollow structures made up of cast plastic pieces with narrow struts in complex shapes. The box-like shapes are load-bearing in one direction but soft in others, an unusual combination achieved by blending stiff and flexible components in different proportions.\n\nThe deformable robots are made with lattice-like pieces called voxels.

An actuator in the center can pull a wire attached to each of the two voxels on either side, contracting them and causing the structure to bend. The whole structure is covered with a rib-like supporting structure and then a tight-fitting waterproof neoprene skin.\n\nAn MIT tow tank test showed its efficiency in the water and demonstrated that it was indeed capable of generating forward thrust sufficient to propel itself forward using undulating motions.\n\nThe team also created a wing-like hydrofoil. Credit: MIT\n\nResearchers state that a snake-like robot built by NASA was made of thousands of unique pieces, whereas this group\u2019s snake is made up of only about 60 individual components. Also, compared to MIT RoboTuna, which took two years to design and build, this device was assembled in about two days.\n\nThe other they demonstrated is a wing-like shape, or hydrofoil, made up of an array of the same voxels but able to change its profile shape and therefore control the lift-to-drag ratio and other properties of the wing.\n\nUltimately, the concept might be applied to a whale-like submersible craft, using its morphable body shape to create propulsion. It could also be applied to parts of other vessels, such as racing yachts, where having a keel or a rudder that could curve gently during a turn instead of remaining straight could provide an extra edge.\n\nJournal reference:",
