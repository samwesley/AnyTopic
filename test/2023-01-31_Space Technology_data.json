            "text": "Indian and US space officials have discussed human space exploration at a two-day meeting in Washington, according to the US State Department.\n\nAt the eighth meeting of the US-India Civil Space Joint Working Group (CSJWG) meeting on Monday and Tuesday, discussions also covered collaboration in earth and space science as well as global navigation satellite systems, spaceflight safety and space situational awareness, and policies for commercial space activities, the Department said.\n\nThe meeting was co-chaired by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jennifer R. Littlejohn and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Associate Administrator Karen Feldstein on the US side and by Shantanu Bhatawdekar, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Scientific Secretary on the Indian side.\n\nA highlight of the NASA-ISRO cooperation is the Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, planned for next year.\n\nIt is expected to systematically map earth, using two different radar frequencies to monitor resources such as water, forests and agriculture.\n\nIt will provide information about ecosystems, the earth's surface, natural hazards, sea level rise and the cryosphere, the frozen parts of the earth, with applications in forestry, agriculture and ecology.\n\nAccording to NASA, it will also help with providing prompt responses to natural and human-created disasters.\n\nNASA Head Bill Nelson and Executive Secretary of the National Space Council, Chirag Parikh gave the welcoming remarks for the meeting and ISRO Chairman S. Somanath and Taranjit Singh Sandhu spoke at the meeting.\n\nDetails of the discussion on cooperation on human space exploration were not released.\n\nWhile astronauts from several countries, including Saudi Arabia, have flown on NASA space missions, but none from India, which has plans for a manned space expedition to be launched as early as next year on board the Gaganyaan spacecraft.\n\nFour Air Force fighter pilots have been trained in Russia under an agreement with Glavkosmos for the mission.\n\nThe only Indian citizen to have been in outer space is Rakesh Sharma, a former Air Force officer who flew on a Soviet Soyuz mission in 1984.\n\nBut four Indian-Americans have been on space missions.\n\nThose who flew on NASA missions are Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, Sunita Williams and Raja Chari.\n\nSirisha Bandla flew on a very brief private sector Virgin Galactic test flight in 2021.\n\n(Arul Louis can be contacted at arul.l@ians.in and followed at @arulouis)\n\n--IANS\n\narul/khz/\n\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

But that dark day proved an opportunity for other Texas Tech alumni to demonstrate the spirit of loyalty and determination that defines Red Raiders.\n\nOn Saturday (Jan. 28), Evermore brought together the Texas Tech and NASA families at Space Center Houston for \u201cRemembering Columbia: A 20th Anniversary Commemoration\u201d to honor those who were lost and celebrate the undying spirit that remains.\n\nThe program will be broadcast at 9 p.m. Wednesday (Feb. 1) on Lubbock's PBS station, channel 5.1.\n\nGlenys Young, the university's Director of Storytelling and editor of Evermore, interviewed Texas Tech alumnae Ginger Kerrick Davis and Evelyn Husband Thompson on stage before a live audience of several hundred.\n\nGinger Kerrick Davis communicated with the crew of the International Space Station on the day of the tragedy.\n\nKerrick Davis, the first Hispanic female flight director in NASA's history and now a Texas Tech regent, shared a personal account of how a family tragedy in her childhood prepared her to lead during and after the events of Feb. 1. She was a capsule communicator for the International Space Station crew at the time and, after the disaster, she played a key role in both communicating the news to the crew and devising the plan that would ultimately bring them home safely.\n\nHusband Thompson, the widow of shuttle commander Rick Husband, shared her story of faith and resilience. After losing her spouse and watching her children lose their father, she became involved with a ministry called Fathers in the Field, which serves boys without a father in their lives. She and Bill Thompson, whom she married in 2008, now serve as a host family for a college student interning at NASA.",

            "text": "An ultrathin protective coating proves sufficient to protect a perovskite solar cell from the harmful effects of space and harden it against environmental factors on Earth, according to newly published research from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\n\nFunded by the U.S. Department of Defense's Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), the NREL research was done for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to develop low-cost innovative energy sources for powering the armed forces worldwide.\n\nThe research is the latest effort to determine the effectiveness of perovskites for use in space applications, where it would be exposed to protons, alpha particles, atomic oxygen, and other stressors. The ability to use perovskites to generate power in space is enticing because they offer a lower-cost and lightweight option to other technologies with the potential for achieving efficiencies similar to those of current space PV technologies.\n\nJust as on Earth, perovskite solar cells need to have suitable durability. However, the environment in space is significantly different. While the biggest challenges on Earth are related to weather, in space perovskites must address the problems that come from radiation bombardment and extreme temperature swings. Perovskites show signs of better tolerance to radiation than many other solar cells, but plenty of testing remains to be conducted.\n\nResearchers last year ran simulations to demonstrate how exposure to radiation in space would affect perovskites. They determined the next-generation technology would work in space but pointed out the need to encapsulate the cell in some way to provide added protection.\n\nIn the follow-up research, Ahmad Kirmani, lead author of the latest Nature Energy paper, said simulations demonstrated a micron-thick layer of silicon oxide would preserve the efficiency and increase the lifetime of perovskite solar cells in space. As a comparison, the micron-thick layer is about 100 times thinner than a typical human hair.\n\nKirmani said the silicon oxide layer could reduce the weight of conventional radiation barriers used for other solar cells by more than 99% and serves as a first step toward designing lightweight and low-cost packaging for perovskites.\n\nHigh-energy protons travel through perovskite solar cells without causing much harm. Low-energy protons, however, are more abundant in space and wreak more havoc on perovskite cells by knocking atoms out of place and causing efficiency levels to steadily decline. The lower energy protons interact with matter much more readily and the addition of the silicon oxide layer protected the perovskite from damage even from the low-energy protons.\n\n\"We thought it would be impossible for the silicon oxide to provide protection against fully penetrating long-range particles such as the high-energy protons and alpha particles,\" Kirmani said. \"However, the oxide layer turned out to be a surprisingly good barrier against those as well.\"\n\nThe results are detailed in the paper \"Metal oxide barrier layers for terrestrial and space perovskite photovoltaics.\" The co-authors are David Ostrowski, Kaitlyn VanSant, Rosemary Bramante, Karen Heinselman, Jinhui Tong, Bart Stevens, William Nemeth, Kai Zhu, and Joseph Luther, from NREL; and several key collaborators who work with the team from the University of North Texas and the University of Oklahoma. VanSant holds the unique position of being a postdoctoral researcher at NASA who conducts research at NREL.\n\nExposure to a stream of low-energy protons caused unprotected perovskite solar cells to lose only about 15% of their initial efficiency, the researchers found. A larger concentration of particles destroyed the cells, while the protected perovskites demonstrated what the scientists described as \"a remarkable resilience.\" With the simple barrier, the cells showed no damage.\n\nIn addition to making the cells more resilient in space, the researchers also tested how the barrier could provide benefit in more conventional applications. They then exposed the perovskite solar cells to an uncontrolled moisture and temperature environment for several days to mimic storage conditions. The protected cells retained their initial 19% efficiency, while the unprotected cells showed significant degradation, from 19.4% to 10.8%. The oxide layer also provided protection when other perovskite compositions typically more sensitive to moisture were exposed to water.\n\nFurther, the perovskite solar cells were subjected to a test chamber where they were bombarded with ultraviolet photons similar to the environment at low-Earth orbit. The photons interacted with oxygen to create atomic oxygen. The unprotected cells were destroyed after eight minutes. The protected cells retained their initial efficiency after 20 minutes and only had a slight drop after 30 minutes.\n\nThe simulations and experiments revealed that by reducing the damage from radiation, the lifetime of the protected solar cells used in Earth's orbits and deep space would be increased from months to years.\n\n\"Power conversion efficiency and operational stability of perovskite solar cells have been the two primary focus areas for the community so far,\" he said. \"We have made a lot of progress and I think we have come far to the point that we might be pretty close to hitting those targets needed for industrialization. However, to really enable this market entry, packaging is the next target.\"\n\nBecause perovskite solar cells can be deposited onto a flexible substrate, the emerging technology, coupled with the protective layer of silicon oxide, allows its use for various terrestrial applications such as powering drones.\n\nNREL is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary national laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development. NREL is operated for DOE by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy LLC.",

SSC launched its first satellite in 1981 which kicked-off the microsatellite revolution and led to University\u2019s successful spin-out company, SSTL. SSC has led numerous space experiments including the \u2018RemoveDebris\u2019 mission which was deployed from the International Space Station and demonstrated how space debris could be captured by nets and harpoons ready for safe disposal. We also recently launched the latest version of our space weather monitor, CREDANCE, on the NASA \u2018Living with a Star\u2019 mission DSX (via a Space-X Falcon-9 Heavy rocket): variants of this design were also included on the recent (albeit unsuccessful) Virgin Orbit launch from Spaceport Cornwall. Our current research portfolio addresses space engineering and applications including space environments, space weather, astrodynamics, electric propulsion, remote sensing and on-board processing. Our funding comes from a very diverse range of sources including ESA, NASA, Met Office, UN, UKSA, Dstl, STFC, NERC, EU and industry. SSC has an extensive range of space test and experimental facilities including a satellite ground station and operations centre; large cleanroom; thermal, vacuum, vibration, radiation and shock environmental test facilities, large granite tables for zero-friction experiments, propulsion laboratory; solar simulation facility and prototyping maker-spaces.

The cosmic explorers told the president about the Israeli space experiments they conducted in, about their work together as a crew, and about their personal experiences onboard the ISS.\n\n\u201cAll of this seemingly infinite possibility isn\u2019t only about reaching beyond ourselves to new planets. It is also about using our new capabilities to preserve and protect this fragile and beautiful planet we call home,\u201d Herzog said at the conference.\n\n\u201cIn fact, when Ilan was aboard the Columbia spacecraft, he talked about how beautiful planet earth appears from all the way up in space, but also about how unspeakably fragile it is. Earth, he said, must be protected. I believe we must work together across borders and divides, to help make life on this planet better for everyone,\u201d he urged.\n\nAt the start of the conference, NASA officials gave Herzog a patch from the Artemis-1 mission, which recently returned to Earth from its journey to lunar orbit. Stibbe also gave Herzog back the glass cube that the president gave him to take to the ISS, inscribed with the Prayer to the State of Israel in the handwriting of its author, Herzog\u2019s grandfather and Israel\u2019s first chief rabbi, Rabbi Yitzhak Isaac HaLevi Herzog.\n\n\u201cThe last great era of space exploration was driven by the competition of the Cold War. I believe that the new era of space exploration can be driven by the goodwill of our warm peace,\u201d Herzog continued.\n\n\u201cLet us walk in the footsteps, or rather soar in the flight paths, of Ilan Ramon and his fellow astronauts, and move upward and onward, harnessing the power of space, for the promise of Earth. Together, we can take space exploration \u2013 and our capacity for human collaboration \u2013 to new heights and save our planet from new and terrifying depths.\u201d",

CAS Space plans three Lijian-1 launches in 2023 and the rocket has recently been approved for launch from a mobile sea platform using facilities at Haiyang in Shandong province.\n\nShikong Tansuo, a space arm of automaker Geely Technology Group, has also settled in Nansha, following a 2021 move by the local government to attract space companies at all stages of the supply chain to the area.\n\nChinese launch firm CAS Space announces progress on its 40-hectare complex in Nansha district in Guangzhou. The development is part of a drive to make the city one of China's major space clusters.https://t.co/kbAqQ5dOZq pic.twitter.com/K67e9FmGSp \u2014 Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) March 23, 2022\n\nCAS Space, sometimes referred to as Zhongke Aerospace, is a commercial spinoff from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).\n\nIt is developing a series of launchers known as Lijian, or PR, rockets, including reusable liquid propellant launchers. A presentation of the series Jan.10 shows lighter solid rockets, shifting to reusable launchers and a rocket for suborbital tourism. The firm is also aiming to have its rockets be selected as backup for cargo transportation to China\u2019s Tiangong space station.\n\nThe designs have been noted online for their apparent resemblance to the SpaceX Falcon 9, the triple-core Falcon Heavy and the Blue Origin New Shepard crew capsule. The Lijian-1 rocket also has similarities with the Jielong-3 rocket developed by CASC. CAS previously flew only sounding rockets before a 2014 opening of the Chinese space sector to other sources of capital.\n\nThe largest and most capable planned rocket is the Lijian-3/PR-3 heavy lift rocket, able to send 13.8 tons to a 500-kilometer-altitude sun-synchronous orbit in expendable mode or 10.5 tons to the same orbit when the boosters are recovered for reuse, according to a presentation at the 9th China (International) Commercial Aerospace Forum in late December.\n\nThe 50-meter-long rocket will have three, 3.8-meter-diameter core stages, no apparent second stage, and be powered by Xuanyuan gas generator kerosene-liquid oxygen engines. CAS Space is targeting 2026 for an inaugural launch.\n\nThe company revealed Jan. 10 that it already has a number of launch contracts signed worth US$237 million. The contracts are with seven customers for launching 200 satellites with a total mass of 40 metric tons. Customers include Beijing-based low Earth orbit communications satellite maker Commsat.\n\nCAS Space raised $31 million in 2021 but leading investors were CITIC Juxin, ultimately owned by state-owned investment company CITIC Group Corporation, Zhongke Chuangxing, an accelerator fund set up by CAS, and Yuexiu Industrial Investment, another state-owned investment vehicle, operating in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nWhile the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) launches almost all of China\u2019s civilian and military missions, CAS Space joins another major state-owned giant spinoff, Expace, in fighting for commercial contracts.\n\nIt also faces competition from other emerging Chinese commercial launch service providers including Galactic Energy, Landspace, iSpace, Deep Blue Aerospace, Space Pioneer, Orienspace and Rocket Pi.",

The firm has previously made early investments in a half dozen aerospace startups, including satellite communications company Akash Systems and space data-focused Slingshot Aerospace, Embedded said.\n\nBut Bryant and Noone noted those deals were fundraised on a case-by-case basis \u2013 with the new fund marking the next stage of Embedded's growth.\n\n\"We have patient capital and \u2013 even if that means we have to miss out on an opportunity \u2013 that's OK. Every company has to go through our diligence process and it's more thorough than most,\" Bryant said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nEmbedded is focused on investing in dual-use technologies, meaning products that serve both commercial and defense customers. In 2021, Embedded signed a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Space Force \u2013 which Noone said has acted as \"a very open door conversation\" between the firm and the military branch.\n\n\"Often venture investors have the first eyes on new technologies,\" Noone said.

The city may do just that, thanks to growth and job opportunities in the aerospace field.\n\nHOUSTON, Texas -- The Houston Spaceport plans to take its offerings to the next level in 2023, including adding new tenants and releasing plans for a consumer-focused Phase 2 of development.\n\nThe video above is from a previous report.\n\n\"Houston is an international city, and we need to be the international hub for hypersonic and supersonic travel,\" said Bob Mitchell, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership. \"And we will be.\"\n\nBuilding out the Spaceport\n\nThe Houston Spaceport is a site for the launching and landing of suborbital, reusable launch vehicles as well as office spaces located on the southeast side of Ellington Airport. The spaceport is anchored by three major tenants.\n\nCollins Aerospace began operations in September in a 125,000-square-foot facility. The company received a task order from NASA in December to begin manufacturing spacesuits to be used in low Earth orbits, Houston Spaceport Director Arturo Machuca said.\n\nRELATED: Axiom Space breaks ground at Houston Spaceport on its new 400,000-square-foot headquarters\n\nIn the same building, the spaceport will also open 10,000 square feet of incubator space for startup companies to use.\n\nConstruction on a 106,000-square-foot facility for Axiom Space is 50% complete and expected to be completed in May. Axiom Space is building the first commercial space station, Mitchell said.\n\nIntuitive Machines, which is building a lunar lander, has a 130,000-square-foot facility at the spaceport. Construction is 50% complete, and it is estimated to finish this summer.\n\n\"These anchor tenants are helping us attract other smaller companies ... looking at potentially setting up their facilities at the Spaceport so they can serve the needs of these larger companies,\" Machuca said.\n\nSEE ALSO: With millions heading to Houston's spaceport, here's how you can break into the aerospace industry\n\nAdditionally, Machuca said the Spaceport has two large prospects looking to join the Spaceport, as well as a number of ongoing conversations with service providers looking at the Spaceport as a potential site. Building relationships and negotiating to get tenants takes months and even years, Mitchell said, but it has significant economic benefits for the region.\n\n\"There's very easily north of $4 billion of contracts for these companies,\" Machuca said. \"So that's really good for our community.\"\n\nPhase 2 of the Spaceport's construction includes a couple of large additions to its infrastructure, Machuca said. Most significantly, a full-length taxiway at over 8,000 feet long will be constructed along Runway 4-22, which is located immediately northwest of the Spaceport. This will open up over 120 acres on the air side for development and connect the Spaceport to the airport operationally.\n\nThe Spaceport plans to select a contractor for the $150 million project by March. After an estimated 18 months of construction, it hopes to finish the new taxiway in 2024.\n\nIn October 2022, the land use plan for the Spaceport was completed. This includes plans for Phase 2, the development of the entire site, introducing retail, hotels, education expansion, and infrastructure such as roads.\n\n\"I really feel like within the next three to five years, all 140 acres that's currently developed for the Spaceport will be full, and we'll be working on the next 140 acres,\" Mitchell said.\n\nThis article comes from our ABC13 partners at Community Impact Newspapers.",

            "text": "Some believe space exploration is a thing of the past, but 2023 holds exciting prospects for proving them wrong. New technologies and players are creating innovative ways for the space industry to forge collaborations between private enterprise and governments and foster new industries.\n\nThe space industry is expected to grow to a $1 trillion enterprise, up 10% each year, and to employ 20,000 people by 2030.\n\nThis week, space industry leaders from NASA and the German, Italian and Greek space agencies, as well as from Portugal, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, met in Tel Aviv for the two-day Ilan Ramon Space Conference. The theme, Earth and Space Becoming One, was highlighted by technologies exhibited at the conference.\n\nIsraeli Space Week is organized each year and led by the Israel Space Agency of the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology. One of the event\u2019s major objectives is to enhance Israelis\u2019 access to science and technology\u2014with special emphasis on the country\u2019s periphery\u2014raise public awareness of the \u201cNew Space\u201d revolution and prepare the next generation of space innovators.\n\n\u201cWe live in a revolutionary era of space exploration,\u201d said Israeli President Isaac Herzog in his opening remarks at the conference. \u201cThe possibilities seem to stretch beyond all we can imagine.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate\n\nby email and never miss\n\nour top stories\n\nHerzog recalled the legacy of Israel\u2019s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, and said that he hopes space exploration will transcend borders and bring peace to the world.\n\n178 orbital launches\n\nTal Inbar, an independent research fellow in aerospace and missile defense, and one of the organizers of the conference, described some of the accomplishments in the field over the past year. They include 178 successful orbital launches led by the U.S., China, Russia, Europe and India. Of the 87 U.S. launches, 61 were undertaken by the Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX).\n\nInbar also pointed to the James Webb Space Telescope, now in a solar orbit, as a major accomplishment that has led to new discoveries in the field of astrophysics. He added that we can expect to hear new information about black holes this week.\n\nIsrael signed the Artemis Accords in January 2022, partnering with the U.S. and 21 other countries on Moon to Mars exploration.\n\nAccording to James Free, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for exploration system development, one of the goals of the Artemis project is to create a sustainable presence on the Moon in preparation for a long-term effort to reach Mars. The project includes exploring new Moon landing sites, melting ice from its polar ice caps and using the water for sustenance and fuel, and planning a two-year stay on the Moon and eventually on Mars.\n\nThe Artemis-I mission, launched on Nov. 16 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carried an international experiment onboard in which the Israel Space Agency, Tel Aviv-based startup StemRad, the German Aerospace Center and NASA were all involved. The experiment examined radiation exposure throughout the flight and tested StemRad\u2019s radiation protection vest.\n\nWhile exploration was a major theme at the conference, another prominent issue was the privatization of space exploration, which may offer new opportunities for research and product development.\n\n\u201cIt was a record year for worldwide space launches,\u201d Inbar pointed out. \u201cMost of the launches of satellites were conducted by SpaceX. We even watched one billionaire private citizen from the U.S. [Elon Musk] conducting a war with Russia with private satellite images. That\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Axiom Mission 1 to the International Space Station last April was crewed by non-professional astronauts from the U.S., Canada and Israel involved in research projects spanning the fields of health, biology, educational outreach and technology. They included augmented reality holograms for communication, which is expected to influence telemedicine.\n\nInbar said that the space economy is booming and, as more private companies join the field, global technology innovators are jumping in as well. For example, the Luna Rover, which is the size of a shoebox, is designed and built in Dubai.\n\nInventors and investors are also beginning to consider how to make money in space.\n\nThe \u2018New Space Revolution\u2019\n\nRenana Ashkenazi of Grove Ventures, a panelist among a group of operations and venture capitalists discussing the investment landscape of the \u201cNew Space Revolution,\u201d is a general partner providing pre-seed, seed and seed-plus funding for startups in Edge computing, cloud, AI, digital health and space. Grove currently has one direct space investment\u2014Ramon Space, a company developing space-proof computer systems for satellites based on a multi-core processor.\n\n\u201cRadiation and extreme temperatures make it hard to maintain and service computers in space,\u201d Ashkenazi explained. \u201cSpace computers require a different computer architecture with more power.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ashkenazi, there has been a steady increase in space technology and investments in it. She predicts they will continue to grow.\n\n\u201cThe space sector was historically only government, but now it\u2019s shifted to civilian,\u201d she said. \u201cThe confluence of reusable and low-cost rockets, small cube sats and increased fuel efficiency all dramatically reduced launch costs. The barrier of access is lower. This opened the window for commercial applications in space. Reaching space is cheaper, so now businesses can figure out what to do once they get there.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that there are new money-making opportunities in space. Uses for earth observation, for example, are endless. Military, navigation, climate and weather analysis satellites can take continuous images of every place on Earth. This is not just used for espionage. As technology develops, these images can be used to better understand the effects of natural disasters and carbon emissions can be tracked. Satellite communication activities provide communication to areas where there is no fiber-optic infrastructure installed, even in the densest jungle. Manufacturers are also finding new uses for space travel. Launch costs are determined by weight, but now parts can be shipped into outer space to be put together on a space station or the Moon.\n\nAshkenazi estimated that there are around 60 Israeli companies in the space industry. Some of them are developing dual-use applications, such as Helios Space, with startup-developed technology that can manufacture oxygen from Moon sand for breathing and fuel. This innovative technology can also be used to manufacture steel in an environmentally-friendly way. She said that while Moon oxygen may be profitable in 10 years, it will take a lot less time to make money on steel manufacturing, so investors can begin to see quick returns.\n\n\u201cIn times of crisis [such as the current economic slowdown] we look for things that we need,\u201d she said. \u201cNot for things that would be nice to have.\u201d\n\nFor example, a company that focuses on Earth observation should do more than just collect images. Investors can ask what the business implications of the intelligence produced might be. When investing, Ashkenazi suggested, one should look for companies that develop solutions to today\u2019s problems.\n\nRadiation protection\n\nOren Milstein, the CEO of StemRad, has been developing products that offer radiation protection in space, but his startup addresses other needs as well.\n\nThe AstroRad vest and technology developed by StemRad offer protection for physicians who work in catheterization labs and will have other key uses here on Earth.\n\n\u201cPrivatization is not about space tourism,\u201d explained one of the SpaceX mission specialists. \u201cIt\u2019s serious research with serious outcomes that takes professional training for worthwhile outcomes.\u201d\n\nIsraeli businesses and investors are taking notice. Some of the companies that gave presentations at the conference included Fink Orbital, Real Estate Developers in Space, which plans to work with companies to create manufacturing plants in space; Axium Space, which intends to build the world\u2019s first commercial space station; and Sierra Space\u2014formerly Sierra/Nevada Corporation\u2014which raised $1.4 billion in its Series A round to develop Orbital Reef, a plan for commercially developed, owned and operated space stations.",

            "text": "Impressive projections for airline revenues, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), bode well for aerospace-defense stocks that are engaged in commercial aerospace-related operations. Yet pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to stocks in the aerospace-defense space. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, cushioned by steady government support, which should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are L EADSY and\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.\n\n4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense Industry\n\nImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in November 2022, industry-wide revenue per kilometer increased 41.3% year over year. This must have driven IATA to forecast that total airline revenues should increase to an estimated 93% of the pre-pandemic level in 2023. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace giants, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.\n\n\n\nExpanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. House passed the $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act in July 2022, thereby authorizing the U.S. government to spend $37 billion more than what President Joe Biden had requested in his budget for national security spending. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.\n\n\n\nSupply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.\n\n\n\nStrengthening Dollar Adds to industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines\u2019 operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy rate now stands at 4.5%, having started 2022 at 0.25%, and will likely peak in 2023 in the vicinity of 5%, as reported by IATA. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #80, which places it in the top 32% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\n\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\n\n\nBefore we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Beats S&P 500, Lags Sector\n\nThe Aerospace-Defense industry has outperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite but underperformed its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 7.5% compared with the Aerospace sector\u2019s slip of 0.8%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has gone down 11.8% in the said timeframe.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for valuing capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.90, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 3.36 and the sector\u2019s 2.25.\n\n\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.99X, as low as 1.51X, and at the median of 1.81X, as the charts show below.\n\nEV-Sales Ratio TTM\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep in Your Watchlist\n\nAirbus Group: Based in Mendelweg, Netherlands, Airbus develops, manufactures, markets and sells commercial jet aircraft, military transport aircraft and special mission aircraft, civil and military helicopters, satellites, orbital infrastructures and launchers as well as space-related services missiles systems, military combat and training aircraft. On Jan 27, 2023, the company announced that Air France-KLM Group has placed a firm order for four A350Fs, the brand new Airbus widebody freighter. This surely reflects the significant position that Airbus already enjoys in the rapidly growing freighter market backed by its expanding e-commerce business worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus\u2019 2022 sales implies a solid improvement of 11% from the 2021 reported figure. The stock also boasts an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 59.88%. EADSY currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nPrice & Consensus: EADSY\n\nLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed is the largest defense contractor in the world, with its main areas of focus being defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. The company recently announced that along with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Air Force Research Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin has accomplished the primary objectives during its second Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) flight test, doubling the amount of scramjet-powered vehicle data. This indicates Lockheed\u2019s significance in the booming hypersonic technologies market.\n\n\n\nLockheed currently boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.9%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 6.86% in the last reported quarter. LMT currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Chance Saltzman told reporters he wants the Guardians who operate satellites and ground systems to be more involved in the process of informing requirements for new systems and making sure the training equipment is adequate.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s best to inform the acquisition community as to what those requirements are but the operators who use it?\u201d Saltzman said during a Jan. 31 media roundtable at the Pentagon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure out how to tighten those linkages.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that capability development and planning organizations like Space Systems Command and the Space Warfighting Analysis Center should share their early digital models of new systems with operators who can then demonstrate them in a training environment and identify what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tight relationship between capability development and how fast we\u2019re doing it with the operational requirements for test and training,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Space Force is on a path toward creating a National Space Test Training Complex that will provide real-world and simulated infrastructure to improve how Guardians practice tactics and how the service develops and fields new capabilities. Space Training and Readiness Command is developing a vision for the range as well as other testing and training infrastructure needs.\n\nSaltzman, who was sworn in as the Space Force\u2019s second chief in early November, said he expects the service\u2019s fiscal 2024 budget to include funding for those efforts.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give specific numbers yet, but we are investing in and developing what I\u2019m loosely calling an operational test and training infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cThat includes simulators, that includes ranges, it includes the testing equipment, it includes the digital engineering efforts.\u201d\n\nSaltzman said he wants to ensure that space operators are prepared to respond to a range of threats \u2014 and he thinks more virtual training infrastructure like simulators can help with that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to build a set of tools that gives maximum flexibility,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with the infrastructure, the Space Force is establishing metrics for gauging how prepared its forces are. STARCOM Commander Maj. Gen. Shawn Bratton told C4ISRNET in September he expects those benchmarks to be completed this year.\n\nSaltzman said today that ensuring that Guardians are equipped with the tools to meet those targets is one of his priorities.\n\n\u201cJust because we have the right systems in orbit or on the ground doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a ready force,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonnel have to be trained. We have to have operational concepts. We have to have tactics that are validated and the operators have to practice those tactics.\u201d\n\nCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET\u2019s space and emerging technology reporter.

            "text": "Astronomers are finding new exoplanets almost every day, but due to the incredible distances between star systems, space exploration has been limited to our solar system. For example, it is estimated that the Voyager 1 spacecraft, presently traveling away from the sun at 10.7 miles per second (17.3 kilometers per second), would take over 73,000 years to reach Proxima b, the nearest confirmed exoplanet.\n\nBut what if traveling to exoplanets were no longer the purview of science fiction? What if we could actually do it?\n\nTo solve this physics-defying conundrum, scientists would have to turn to propulsion systems that are far more advanced than the chemical rockets we currently employ for our exploration needs. One such proposed technology is antimatter-based propulsion, which, as its name implies, involves using antimatter to power a spacecraft to velocities reaching a few percent of the speed of light .\n\nRelated: Is interstellar travel really possible?\n\nAntimatter isn't new for physics; its existence was first confirmed in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who discovered positrons, electrons that exhibit a positive charge instead of a negative one. But how important is it to establish antimatter-based propulsion systems to explore beyond our solar system ?\n\n\"Setting priorities is always a matter of weighing costs and benefits,\" Gerald Jackson, co-founder and president of Hbar Technologies Inc. and the author of a new paper investigating the idea of using antimatter-based propulsion for exoplanet exploration, told Space.com in an email. \"Is antimatter-based propulsion for interstellar travel more important than childhood glioma in the next year? Of course not. In my opinion, there should at least be some small amount of support for long-term technologies that are not needed in the current or next fiscal year. There are many examples of technologies that enjoy low level support, only for society to find that they desperately need it.\n\n\"There are many scenarios where humanity may find that it needs to quickly send spacecraft into interstellar space,\" he said. \"In my opinion antimatter-based propulsion is the best solution for such a need.\"\n\nJackson's study focuses primarily on the physics responsible for the propulsion system to work, with an emphasis on nuclear fission ; the paper describes an electrostatic nozzle and trap meant to carry out the necessary fission. So when could we expect this antimatter-based propulsion technology to actually be developed? This is a common question but also a common trap, Jackson said.\n\n\"Robert Goddard developed liquid fuel rockets, staging, and gyroscopic guidance systems long before they were needed for manned [sic] exploration of low Earth orbit and the moon,\" he told Space.com in an email. \"If it had not been for World War II and the subsequent Cold War, you could argue that mankind would still have not landed on the moon. In human history, need plays a dominant role in technology development speed. I do not have a good enough crystal ball to give a good answer. Of course, funding levels go hand-in-hand with need.\"\n\nJackson referenced attempts to develop the necessary technology to travel to Proxima b. One such attempt was the May 2016 decree by then-U.S. Rep. John Culberson that NASA travel to the Alpha Centauri system by 2069, the 100th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. But Jackson noted that there is \"insufficient time for any prospective technology to be developed sufficiently to meet that optimistic date.\" He also cited Breakthrough Starshot as another ongoing attempt to send a mission to Proxima b but noted that there's still a long way to go.\n\n\"At this moment there is almost no research money dedicated to advanced, deep-space propulsion research,\" he told Space.com in an email. \"Sporadically there are miniature bursts of activity, such as current work resurrecting nuclear propulsion for manned Mars missions and privately funded Starshot. Even the NASA NIAC [Innovative Advanced Concepts] program is spread too thin to provide consistent funding. What is needed is a long-term, steady level of funding that allows a dozen researchers or so to work for decades on a broad array of innovative propulsion concepts.\"\n\nThe antimatter propulsion proposal is described in a paper published in the journal Nuclear Technology .",
