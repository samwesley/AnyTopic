The student-run Ham Radio Club \u2013 about a dozen students strong \u2013 spent the last four months plus on a project to connect with the International Space Station -- on Monday, it was mission accomplished.\n\nAnthony Girasoli, the NFA director of technology said, \u201cIt is the biggest day ever, we\u2019ve never done anything as big as this in our club, so the students are really excited and is all been student driven.\u201d\n\nGirasoli helped to secure a $10,000 grant that awarded the NFA Ham Radio Club the new equipment needed to connect with the ISS. Clark Dziavit, an NFA freshman member of the Ham Radio Club said, \u201cAll of the students in the club, we\u2019ve done the research, it\u2019s really a team effort.\u201d\n\nStudents had a ten-minute window to fire off questions to Dr. Josh Cassada, a NASA astronaut who has been aboard the ISS for 180 days. Cassada was excited and receptive to all the questions that ranged from what astronauts eat aboard the ISS to the impact that zero-gravity has on their bodies.\n\nJulia Sujeki, a Norwich Free Academy junior and member of the Ham Radio Club said, \u201cOnce you think about this in 20 or 10 years you are going to say, \u2018look what I did in high school\u2019 and this will definitely be one of those things you will remember.\u201d Dziavit added, \u201cthis is a once in a lifetime opportunity, this is definelty an incredible thing.\u201d\n\nJimmy Altman is a reporter at FOX61 News.

            "text": "Proprietary \"Exosphere\" Approach To Enhance Exploration at Nisk Mining Project\n\nTORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / January 31, 2022 / Power Nickel Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Power Nickel\") (TSX-V:PNPN)(OTCQB:CMETF)(Frankfurt:IVVI)\n\nPower Nickel, a Canadian metal exploration company, has announced a partnership with Australian-based Fleet Space Technologies, a developer and operator of a constellation of microsatellites that delivers universal connectivity across the globe, including the exploration of Nickel ore deposits at its NISK project. Power Nickel, which specializes in the exploration of high-potential nickel, copper, gold, and other battery metal prospects in Canada and Chile, will use innovative sound mapping technology from Fleet Space to locate additional high-grade nickel sulfide deposits with a greater level of accuracy.\n\nCalled \"ExoSphere,\" a rapid mineral exploration solution, Fleet Space mapping technology has already delivered promising results in exploration projects for high-grade nickel in Michigan and Minnesota. The satellite-enabled earth scanning technique is called Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT). Battery-powered devices known as \u2018Geodes', which can be transported by hand, are used to capture background vibrations from natural and man-made sources. The data can be used to develop a full 3D visualization of the subsurface down to 2 km depth. Fleet's Geodes are up to 10x more sensitive than existing nodal geophones, leading to better accuracy and depth of results. The exploration team can get a clear, rich image of what resources may be below ground in a period that can be as short as four days. These can be easily shared and viewed from anywhere in the world in near real-time. The data thus obtained is processed rapidly and transmitted from anywhere in the world through Fleet's constellation of low-earth orbit satellites, which were recently launched by Elon Musk's company, SpaceX.\n\nHistorically nickel sulfide deposits are located in the form of pods in a geographic area. It is expected that the nickel ore deposits at NISK are also in the form of such pods. Currently, Power Nickel is exploring 1 square kilometer of its 45 square kilometer land package. Using Fleet Space's earth scanning technology, Power Nickel hopes to optimize its chances of finding additional deposits and increase its drilling accuracy as part of a well-developed drilling program. Another benefit that the use of the technology offers is that due to its higher level of accuracy in detecting nickel ore deposits, it can decrease land disturbance in the exploration stage.\n\nStory continues\n\nPower Nickel, the company's flagship NISK project, has high-grade nickel sulfide deposits that have the potential to be among the most low-cost and environmentally-friendly sources of high-grade nickel in the world. This is due to several factors: the mine's proximity to a hydropower facility, established infrastructure, and shallow mineral depth. Indonesia's recent ban on export of nickel is likely to have a major impact on the supply chain for critical products like electric vehicles and rocket engines. This points to the urgent need for countries like Canada and the US to become self-reliant with regard to nickel supplies in light of the growing demand for vehicles running on clean energy.\n\nCommenting on the partnership, Terry Lynch, the CEO of Power Nickel said, \"While we are having excellent success drilling at Nisk as evidenced by our recent drill results. We are looking for lots more drill cores like this. A sampling of core from hole 23 that we completed last week.\n\nPower Nickel Inc., Tuesday, January 31, 2023, Press release picture\n\n\"Fleet Space Technologies has already successfully used this technology in Australia and now in Minnesota. By using this advanced seismic tomography approach in combination with our in-house methods, we hope to increase our chances of finding more nickel ore pods at a faster rate. The two main advantages this technology offers are that we can now explore our 45-square-kilometer land package in a fraction of the time we need using traditional ground-based methods. The second advantage is that with this data, we can drill fewer meters but with increased impact. Use of this technology aligns well with our goal of making nickel mining cleaner, faster, and more environmentally friendly right from the exploration phase.\"\n\nFleet Space founder Flavia Tata Nardini said, \"We're delighted to see ExoSphere deployed in Canada for the first time, building on our success in the US and elsewhere around the world. As well as great technology and commercial partnership, this is a real meeting of minds. We both understand the urgent need to accelerate the discovery process for these vital minerals, but we're also equally committed to minimizing their environmental impact. Power Nickel is precisely the kind of forward-thinking, responsible enterprise ExoSphere was designed for: it's great to be working with them on this project.\"\n\nQualified Person\n\nKenneth Williamson, G\u00e9o, M.Sc. from 3DGeo Solution Inc and consultant to Power Nickel, is the independent qualified person who has reviewed and approved the technical disclosure contained in this news release.\n\nAbout Power Nickel Inc.\n\nPower Nickel is a Canadian junior exploration company focusing on high-potential copper, gold, and battery metal prospects in Canada and Chile.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, Power Nickel (then called Chilean Metals) completed the acquisition of its option to acquire up to 80% of the Nisk project from Critical Elements Lithium Corp. (CRE:TSXV)\n\nThe NISK property comprises a large land position (20 kilometers of strike length) with numerous high-grade intercepts. Power Nickel is focused on expanding its current high-grade nickel-copper PGE mineralization Ni 43- 101 resource with a series of drill programs designed to test the initial Nisk discovery zone and to explore the land package for adjacent potential Nickel deposits.\n\nHighlights\n\nRecent assay results from the current drill program at the Nisk deposit continue to return high-grade Ni-Cu- Co sulfide and PGE mineralization.\n\nSignificant results from this batch of assays include:\n\n40.3m @ 0.88% Ni, 0.56% Cu, 0.06% Co, 1.64 ppm Pd and 0.15 ppm Pt (PN-22-009)\n\nIncluding:\n\n25.86m @ 1.17% Ni, 0.80% Cu, 0.08% Co, 1.46 ppm Pd and 0.23 ppm Pt\n\nPower Nickel announced on June 8th, 2021, that an agreement has been made to complete the 100% acquisition of its Golden Ivan project in the heart of the Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle has reported mineral resources (past production and current resources) in a total of 130 million ounces of gold, 800 million ounces of silver, and 40 billion pounds of copper.(Resource World) This property hosts two known mineral showings (Gold ore and Magee), and a portion of the past-producing Silverado mine, which was reportedly exploited between 1921 and 1939. These mineral showings are described as polymetallic veins containing quantities of silver, lead, zinc, plus/minus gold, and plus/minus copper.\n\nPower Nickel is also 100 percent owner of five properties comprising over 50,000 acres strategically located in the prolific iron-oxide-copper-gold belt of northern Chile. It also owns a 3-per-cent NSR royalty interest on any future production from the Copaquire copper-molybdenum deposit, which was sold to a subsidiary of Teck Resources Inc. Under the terms of the sale agreement, Teck has the right to acquire one-third of the 3-per-cent NSR for $ 3 million at any time. The Copaquire property borders Teck's producing Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile's first region.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nMr. Terry Lynch, CEO\n\n647-448-8044, terry@powernickel.com\n\nPower Nickel Inc.\n\nThe Canadian Venture Building\n\n82 Richmond St East, Suite 202\n\nToronto, ON\n\nMedia Contact\n\nName: Terry Lynch\n\nEmail: terry@powernickel.com\n\nWebsite: www.powernickel.com\n\nAbout Fleet Space Technologies\n\nFleet Space Technologies is Australia's leading space company.

            "text": "A machine learning method that could be used to efficiently identify unusual radio signals from space for further investigation, while filtering out interference, is reported in a paper published in Nature Astronomy. The research uses data from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Breakthrough Listen Initiative and identified eight previously undetected signals of interest, although they have not been re-detected in follow-up observations.\n\nIt has been suggested that the detection of certain types of radio signals could be an indication of potential technological life, given that artificial radio signals can be distinguished from natural ones. SETI programmes have been scanning the sky with radio telescopes for decades to detect unambiguous artificial signals coming from the stars. However, this search is complicated by interference from human technology, which can generate false positive identifications that are time-consuming to filter out from large data sets.\n\nPeter Ma and colleagues present a machine learning-based selection method that they apply to more than 480 hours of data from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, observing 820 stars. The method analysed 115 million snippets of data, from which it identified around 3 million signals of interest. The method was then able to further reduce this to 20,515 signals, which is more than 100 times less than previous analyses of the same dataset. The authors inspected the 20,515 signals and they identified 8 previously undetected signals of interest, although follow-up observations of these targets have not re-detected them.\n\nThe authors suggest their method could be applied to other big datasets to accelerate SETI and similar data-driven surveys.",

It is managed by the AFRL Transformational Capabilities Office and has program partners in both the U.S. Space Force and U.S. Air Force. It\u2019s set to \u201cpush the boundary of PNT technology to pave the way for a more flexible, robust and resilient architecture for satellite navigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis major milestone marks the transition from space system development at contractor\u2019s facilities to the final stage of integration and test activities,\u201d said Arlen Biersgreen, NTS-3 program manager, according to the release. \u201cThe AFRL team will be overseeing and working closely with L3Harris and other key industry partners to apply an effective combination of contractor and government resources to successfully complete this phase of the effort.\u201d\n\nThe next step is for AFRL and L3Harris to complete the remaining intra-payload and payload-to-bus functional and performance tests. This includes the first radio frequency broadcast tests of the novel PNT signals that will be demonstrated from near-geosynchronous orbit after the satellite is launched.\n\nThe team will then perform standard tests that simulate the launch and space environments, verifying the system is ready for operation in space.\n\nExperimental performance data from ground testing will be available for program partners over the next several months.\n\nThe Global Navigation Satellite System Test Architecture, or GNSSTA, is being developed by MITRE Corporation in partnership with the AFRL Sensors Directorate. This reprogrammable software-defined receiver allows users to receive both legacy GPS and advanced signals generated by NTS-3, and is critical for meeting end-to-end NTS-3 mission objectives. It lays the groundwork for future operational receivers that will provide the Space Force with ways to prevent and quickly respond to battlefield threats like jamming and spoofing.\n\nEarlier this month, the sensors team working on GNSSTA development and testing successfully generated signals on the spacecraft and received them with experimental GNSSTA user equipment, an important step, Dr. Joanna Hinks, the NTS-3 principal investigator, said, according to the release.\n\nNTS-3 is the first U.S. experiment of its kind in nearly 50 years.\n\n\u201cThis Vanguard not only aims to support GPS users through vital development of new technologies and techniques,\u201d Biersgreen said, \u201cbut also to show how an agile and responsive U.S. satellite navigation architecture is paramount to defeating the most challenging threats to warfighter success, both today and through the coming decades.\u201d",

            "text": "The recent wave of layoffs among technology companies has further diminished the industry\u2019s commitment to commercial real estate office space, Bisnow reports. Tech companies were a major office tenant during the past decade, but the industry\u2019s leasing numbers have dropped in recent years. The sector leased 2.2 million square feet during the fourth quarter of 2022, a 57-percent decrease from the prior quarter, according to a recent Savills report. It\u2019s an even bigger drop from a year ago, when more than 8.5 million square feet was leased.\n\nAs tech companies have begun to cut jobs, some in the CRE industry believe these leasing numbers will get worse before they get better.\n\n\u201cWhen the economic environment started to weaken, it created even greater uncertainty around when people were going to come back to the office, how much office space you need, and do we have the funds to make big commitments to additional leased and improved space?\u201d Colin Yasukochi, executive director of CBRE\u2019s Tech Insights Center told Bisnow. \u201cThat led to a decline in the amount of leasing activity by the tech industry, which withdrew a pretty big component of demand.\u201d\n\nThe tech industry has leased more office space than any other sector since 2010, per CRBE\u2019S Tech 30 2022 report. Tech\u2019s total leasing activity by square footage jumped from 12 percent in 2010 to 21 percent in 2021. Midway through 2022 however, the industry\u2019s share of leasing activity fell to 16 percent as venture capital funding slowed and the economy suffered.\n\nMeanwhile, approximately 74,000 tech workers were laid off during the final quarter of 2022, per Savills and 190,000 jobs overall last year, according to Layoffs.fyi. The layoffs don\u2019t appear to be slowing down anytime soon; Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet (Google) have all cut at least 10,000 employees each in 2023 already, Bisnow reports.\n\nHow tech layoffs impact CRE\n\nThe ongoing layoffs in the tech industry signal companies are closely monitoring costs, which includes CRE spending. A lot of firms have opted to temporarily vacate their office space, according to Bisnow. This decision had led to the industry\u2019s sublease volume reaching almost 145 million square feet during the second quarter of 2022 \u2014 it was 60 million square feet during the same time period in 2019, per CBRE. San Francisco (79 percent), Silicon Valley (69 percent) and Austin (44 percent) were the leading markets when it came to returning sublease space, according to Savills.\n\nThe fact that tech companies are subleasing office space versus giving it up completely could be a sign the industry isn\u2019t 100 percent opposed to returning to in-person work at some point, according to Yasukochi. However, since a lot of these firms leased more space than they needed, it will take time to figure out how to manage the excess square footage, he said.\n\nTech\u2019s cooled relationship with the CRE office market isn\u2019t completely economy-based, however. The industry initially gravitated toward remote work and hybrid setups when the COVID-19 pandemic began. Office demand has gone up and down ever since, especially in popular tech areas like San Francisco.\n\nMeta said it plans to put its 435,000 square foot San Francisco office on the sublease market earlier this month, Bisnow reports. The company also announced plans to sublease 589,000 square feet in Austin and it ended a 200,000 square foot office lease in Manhattan last October.\n\nWhat lies ahead for office CRE\n\nAustin has seen its technology workforce grow in recent years, leading to more office space demand. Increased sublease supply could potentially alter the market\u2019s dynamics, Bisnow reports.\n\nSuch a change might not be such a bad thing however, according to Erin Morales, principal and managing director of Avison Young\u2019s Austin office. There\u2019s been so much more demand than supply recently that smaller tech companies have been unable to compete.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at it through a rose-tinted lens, you could say there\u2019s opportunity here for other users that were getting elbowed out a little bit to find the space that they need and want to have a successful business here in Austin,\u201d Morales said.\n\nMorales also noted that there\u2019s a potential rental rate correction ahead. Increased technology job growth in markets such as Boston, Denver, Salt Lake City, Seattle and Austin have generated rent increases of more than 10 percent between the second quarters of 2020 and 2022, according to CBRE.\n\nTech\u2019s leasing numbers should increase as the economy improves, Yasukochi told Bisnow. The pandemic changed the industry\u2019s relationship with office CRE, but as tech grows, office space will likely remain a necessary cost.\n\n\u201cTech has always seen a pretty strong recovery coming out of these recessions,\u201d Yasukochi said. \u201cThey are tightening their belts and setting themselves up to weather the storm, and then they\u2019ll start to invest in the right places and grow when the economy justifies it.\u201d",

            "text": "Share Article\n\nThe Space Force must transition from delivering behind-the-scenes support to playing a more active role in which space capabilities are continuously tested and contested\u2014and it must do so in as short a time as possible, said Chief of Space Operations Gen. B. Chance Saltzman in a weekend address to Air & Space Forces Association field leaders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a race to build combat credibility before we\u2019re put to the test,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the competition phase through crisis and conflict, the Space Force is a critical element of the joint force and plays a vital role in integrated deterrence. \u2026 We have a responsibility to secure the space domain to defend U.S. service members in harm\u2019s way. We must contest to control the space domain, or else those service members will be at unacceptable risk of attack.\u201d\n\nAdversaries are posing threats to U.S. capabilities in space but also leveraging commercial space capabilities against America and its allies, Saltzman said.\n\n\u201cDid you know that the Iranians were using commercial space based ISR to help with the targeting and the missile attack they conducted against U.S. bases in Iraq?\u201d Saltzman said.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned a Chinese firm for providing space-based radar imagery to the Wagner group, the Russian mercenary force that has recently increased its operations in Ukraine. Changsha Tianyi Space Science and Technology Research Institute Co., also called Spacety China, have provided Terra Tech synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery to Wagner for locations in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway is that, going forward, the joint force is going to have to think through what operating under persistent ISR it looks like,\u201d Saltzman said. The Space Force must be able to challenge those capabilities, he added, \u201cto find ways to protect the joint force from this space-enabled attack.\u201d\n\nSaltzman\u2019s primary focus since becoming CSO has been operationalizing the Space Force, focusing more on threats, threat response, and countering adversary actions. This, he said, is a continuous process.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no magic day in the future when we declare, \u2018We\u2019ve arrived, we\u2019re ready to respond,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a spectrum of readiness that begins today. And every day that goes by, we will improve our ability.\u201d\n\nLines of Effort\n\nSaltzman defined three lines of effort recently in his first three \u201cC-Notes.\u201d These direct communications to all members of the Space Force, both military and civilian, are inspired by another young service chief from a different time and domain\u2014Navy Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., who became Chief of Naval Operations on July 1, 1970, almost a year to the day after Saltzman was born, wrote a series of 121 direct communications with Navy personnel over his four years as CNO. Known as \u201cZ-grams,\u201d he used these notes to build trust and understanding in Navy leadership and to open a dialog with Sailors.\n\nSaltzman\u2019s intial C-Notes\u2014short for CSO notes\u2014aren\u2019t as specific as many of Zumwalt\u2019s Z-grams, many of which initiated significant policy directives on everything from leave regulations to race relations, but they do open up his view of issues Guardians are talking about and wrestling with daily.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, we must field resilient, ready, combat-credible forces,\u201d he said Jan. 28. \u201cEach of these descriptors is important and must be clearly understood. A resilient force is one that can withstand, fight through ,and recover from attacks. A ready force has the trained personnel, equipment, and sustainment capacity to accomplish missions and tasks in a high intensity operational environment. And a combat credible force has demonstrated the ability to conduct offensive and defensive operations against an adversary. All three are important.\u201d\n\nSaltzman said it will take both technology and the trained, ready people who operate that technology to achieve the military\u2019s objectives. \u201cTechnology makes space operations possible. But the Space Force does not present technology systems or capabilities to the joint force, we present Space Forces. \u2026 As the Russian military in Ukraine is showing us right now, a high-tech weapon system will be operationally ineffective\u201d without the trained personnel and sustainment systems needed to execute the mission.\n\n\u201cLet me offer a few observations about this war, looking at it through a spacepower lens,\u201d Saltzman added. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s clear that space is viewed as a critical enabler to both militaries [in the conflict in Ukraine]. Both sides have attacked SATCOM capabilities to degrade command and control, and there\u2019s been a concerted effort to interfere with GPS to reduce its effectiveness in the region.\n\n\u201cSecond, the clear connection between space and cyber became apparent with a Russian cyber attack against a commercial satellite communications network used by the Ukraine\u2019s military.\n\n\u201cThird, the value of proliferated constellations and commercial augmentation was clearly demonstrated with Ukrainian integration of SpaceX\u2019s Starlink SATCOM system. Acquiring access to this system enhanced the Ukrainian [command and control] structure and it\u2019s proven much harder to target and degrade than previous systems.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, we\u2019ve observed that even the best\u2014and this may be the most important point\u2014even the best military equipment does not ensure success on the battlefield. A modern military must have well trained operators, well-rehearsed multi-domain operations, effective tactics, and robust logistics and sustainment.\u201d\n\nYet what\u2019s been seen in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is only a glimpse of the kind of challenges that could lay ahead: \u201cThe Chinese have multiple ground-based lasers, numerous jammers targeting wide swaths of SATCOM frequencies and GPS,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cBoth Russia and China have invested in cyber capabilities which threaten our ground networks. \u2026 Anywhere the Space Force operates, there are threats. And these threats can attack across multiple domains and multiple attack vectors.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s space capabilities are now integrated into its other systems, tying together 290 ISR satellites, 49 precision-navigation-and-timing satellites, and \u201ca growing number of rapid response launch capabilities.\u201d\n\nTo counter all that, the Space Force is rapidly developing new capabilities, but Saltzman\u2019s focus is most on the people who must operate those future systems.\n\n\u201cAre the operators ready to employ them?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo they understand the tactics? Do they have a place to train and practice? Or are they just going to be thrown onto the floor and say, \u2018Do the best you can when the adversary shows up?\u2019\u201d\n\nSaltzman is challenging his small force of about 8,000 Guardians to consider what they need in the way of doctrine, infrastructure, and organizations, and to more fully imagine and define what it means to be combat-credible in the future.\n\n\u201cWe tend to think about the global nature of space operations,\u201d he said, noting that the responsibility for the entire space domain belongs with the unified U.S. Space Command. \u201cBut let\u2019s talk about regional space. Let\u2019s talk about more localized space. \u2026 Let\u2019s talk about missile warning. I think most people would say missile warning is a global enterprise, right? You have satellites spread around the ring. They\u2019re monitoring the whole earth, from Colorado, and when they get a missile event, they process it and they disseminate it back out to the warfighters.\u201d\n\nBut to get that information to the right people so they can get out of harm\u2019s way and defend themselves is not what U.S. Space Command does, Saltzman pointed out. The warnings might go to a regional Air Operations Center, but from there they need to get to the far-flung organizations that work with the AOC. \u201cWhat about the FOBs and FARPs?\u201d he asked, referring to forward operating bases and refueling points. \u201cHow do they get missile warning?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the new service components that the Space Force has been standing up come into play\u2014the first stood up under U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in November, and others have since been established in Korea and at U.S. Central Command. These organizations help grease the wheels of communication between the services and their component commands.\n\n\u201cThe space component has a responsibility to make sure that the missile warning track that gets to the AOC now gets to every single person that needs it,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very dynamic environment. FOBs and FARPs are changing constantly.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s focus on Agile Combat Employment, in which forces move dynamically to different operating locations to be less predictable and more complicated for adversaries to target makes that a an even more fluid, complex task.\n\n\u201cWe are bouncing forces around continuously to keep our enemies guessing where our forces can be and that doesn\u2019t stop a missile warning architecture from having to give get them missile warning data wherever they are,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cSpace Command can\u2019t do that, \u2026 there\u2019s too many of them. So you need space experts who understand procedurally and architecturally how to provide this warning to everybody that needs it.\u201d",

The 47 Fellows were selected through a fair and extremely competitive application process involving written and creative submissions, interviews with the Fellowship\u2019s leadership team and its close network, and interviews with leading aerospace employers from across multiple sectors in the US aerospace industry. Almost 1,000 promising and talented students applied worldwide, coming from Ivy League universities, major research universities, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU\u2019s), liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and major international universities. The Fellows were selected based on their incredible talent, desire to pursue a career in aerospace, stand-out creative abilities, record of leadership and most importantly commitment to their communities.\n\nThe Brooke Owens Fellows will each be matched to an executive-level mentor in the aerospace industry who will support and work with the Fellows to help launch their careers. This summer, the Fellows will start their internships and come together for the annual Brooke Owens Summit in Washington, DC. The Class of 2023 will also become part of the network of 249 Brookie alumni spanning all aspects of space and aviation including engineering, scientific research, policy, journalism, and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe Brooke Owens Fellowship was founded in 2016 to honor the memory of beloved industry pioneer and accomplished pilot D. Brooke Owens, who passed away in June 2016 at the age of 35, after a hard-fought battle with cancer. The program was co-founded by Lori Garver, the former Deputy Administrator of NASA; Cassie Lee, CEO of Sound Future; and William Pomerantz, the Vice President for Special Projects at Virgin Orbit. The Brooke Owens Fellowship celebrates its ongoing mission and legacy of disrupting the historical gender imbalance in the aerospace industry by continuing its mission to provide opportunities and access to talented young professionals from women and gender minorities from all backgrounds.\n\nToday, the Brooke Owens Fellowship is led by the 5-person Executive Team that includes Caroline Juang, a Ph.D. Candidate at Columbia University in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences; Emily Calandrelli, a science communicator and host of Netflix\u2019s Emily\u2019s Wonder Lab; Kayla Watson, a System Reliability Engineer at Amazon Prime Air; Lori Garver, co-founder of the Brooke Owens Fellowship and former Deputy Administrator of NASA; and Will Pomerantz, co-founder of the Brooke Owens Fellowship and Vice President of Special Projects at Virgin Orbit. Earlier this month, Diana Trujillo, Former Mars Perseverance Mission Lead at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, transitioned off the team after two years of service, and Garver was welcomed back into the day-to-day activities of the Executive Team. During this transition, both Trujillo and Garver were active members in selecting the newly-announced class of 2023 Brookies.\n\nOn behalf of the Executive Team, Garver says, \u201cWe are overjoyed to welcome our seventh class of \u2018Brookies\u2019, to the Fellowship, which is now providing nearly 300 women and gender minorities access to the ever more important aerospace industry. The program is expanding the diversity of the workforce in the sector and the experience and knowledge gained by these talented individuals will help it deliver a better future for humanity.\u201d\n\nThe 2023 Brooke Owens Fellows are:",

(SSTL) to initiate Faraday Dragon, an Asia-Pacific (APAC) regional satellite rideshare mission that is targeted for launch in 2025. Faraday Dragon will fly multiple payloads for regional space players including government, commercial, financial, research and educational organizations.\n\nIn-Space Missions, which is owned by BAE Systems, is collaborating with Singapore Space on a service-orientated model which aims to support and develop satellite assembly and payload integration capabilities in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific region. Faraday Dragon will be presented at a workshop facilitated by SSTL at the Global Space and Technology Convention (GSTC) being held in Singapore in February. The workshop will bring together key stakeholders and industry to define a future in-orbit demonstration capability. Core technologies and processes for a variety of applications will be discussed at the workshop including optical payloads (both visible and infra-red), RF sensing, radar, processors, machine learning and artificial intelligence, communications, propulsion, formation flying, metrology and timing.\n\nThe Faraday Rideshare satellite platform and service capability has been developed by In-Space Missions, with support from the UK Space Agency, to provide a full turnkey system for enabling diverse organisations to get payloads into space at a very competitive price that cannot be achieved using a dedicated satellite solution. The platform design includes innovative on-board processing to deliver sophisticated, flexible and re-configurable data from multiple sensors on board the spacecraft, providing the potential for a rich flow of data from new technologies for the downstream sector.\n\nValue added services from Faraday Dragon could also include on-orbit processing (edge processing), subsequent timely delivery of actionable information to a user community and a full end-to-end service to customers that includes payload operations support, satellite bus operations, payload tasking and download of data via a Customer Data Portal.\n\nIn-Space Missions is also seeking partners and collaborators in theAPAC region for the InSpace Digital system, launching in 2024, to trial payload applications that can be run on the ground or uploaded (or both) and make use of a unique combination of data from multiple optical payloads, Synthetic Aperture Radar and an RF multi-band and wide band collect system.\n\nInSpace Digital is a reprogrammable, multi-sensor system of four satellites that can be repurposed for different applications and commercial use. It can be reprogrammed to use multiple optical payloads and the RF multi-band and wide band collect system on three of the spacecraft, along with the SAR payload on the fourth, to generate pre-processed results to deliver value added data or actionable information to users. The system includes inter-satellite links between the spacecraft, precision timing and metrology and inter-satellite links via GEO for low volume data and tasking.\n\n\u201cThe Faraday Dragon rideshare mission is designed to contribute to the regional eco-system by bringing multiple payloads together on one satellite platform to provide a more cost-effective and sustainable ride to orbit for pre-cursor missions, early service rollout, technology demonstration, and in-orbit flight qualification of new technologies. Our customers will be able to access the performance of a 150kg class small satellite for a fraction of the cost of traditional flight services as well as access our in-orbit \u2018Digital\u2019 system to take advantage of coherent multi-sensing and processing,\u201d said Tony Holt, Chief Sales Officer for In-Space\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be working with In-Space Missions to bring a low-cost option to space players in the Asia Pacific region. One of the biggest challenges faced by emerging players developing frontier space technologies is the cost of space heritage. It is through partnerships like this that SSTL is able to support cutting edge innovation by lowering the barriers to entry,\u201d said Jonathan Hung, Executive Chairman at Singapore Space and Technology Limited.",

            "text": "Houston-based Nauticus Robotics\u2019 first production Aquanauts and Hydronauts will head into the wild and closer to full commercialization this year, with testing planned in Norway and in the Gulf of Mexico. Founder and CEO Nicolaus Radford discusses the past few busy years for the tech start-up.\n\nIt\u2019s been a relatively fast journey for Nauticus. Set up in 2014 (as Houston Mechatronics Inc), the company has been a bit of an outsider in the offshore industry, against incumbents offering (for the most part) more traditional looking underwater robotic systems.\n\nHowever, the third quarter of 2022 saw the company (whose investors include Schlumberger (SLB) and Transocean) complete a business combination with CleanTech Acquisition Corp., netting it nearly $60 million to fund its first fleet of ocean robots; list on the Nasdaq exchange; agree a trial with energy giant Shell; win a contract with the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit; and agree a defense related partnership with tech giant Leidos.\n\nIt now has three of its second-generation Aquanauts in build in Vancouver, which will be used on trials in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Norway, and two Hydronaut uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), which will act as launch and recovery systems and surface gateways to Aquanauts, in-build in the UK.\n\nCEO Nicolaus (Nic) Radford, who set up the firm in his living room eight years ago, doesn\u2019t hold back his ambition. Innovation has been \u201cmind numbingly slow\u201d in the offshore industry, he says. Part of Nauticus\u2019 ambition is to \u201cput an adrenaline shot\u201d into it, by taking robotics technology developed for space flight into the ocean.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to have a network of Aquanauts and Hydronauts out there working, a whole Navy of them, being controlled by control centers around the world, out there 24/7 doing their thing. That's the core of the business. There's an ocean of opportunity to take advantage of,\u201d he says, from fisheries to countering global security threats, which have heightened recently, with increased underwater surveillance to protect critical infrastructure, such as pipelines and communications cables.\n\n\n\nImage courtesy Nauticus\n\n\u201cI'm fired up as you can as you can possibly get about this industry and I think there's so many different facets to move into,\u201d he says. \u201cFrankly, it's huge. It's enormous, it's completely front and center right now. It's the epicenter for all of our resources, right? Food, minerals, energy.\u201d\n\nThat adds up to an estimated $2.5 trillion marine economy, of which some $30 million could be addressable the types of ocean robotics it\u2019s building, according to Nauticus.\n\nBorn in Illinois, Radford graduated with a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering then joined NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Centre and pretty much went straight into robotics, including DARPA sponsored programs, before moving to Houston, working with United Space Alliance and then Oceaneering Space Systems as a contractor to NASA, again in robotics.\n\n\u201cAt NASA I learned a ton of stuff, but uncovered this idea that there was meaningful change to be made in the ocean domain,\u201d he says. \u201cI had had some exposure to the ocean world before and remember the first time I saw an ROV I was like, OK, that's cute, but we can do so much better. Then you realize they don't want to do any better.\u201d\n\nA part of the problem is incentives and the ability to disrupt. \u201cSome of the big incumbent players have very successful businesses, but it ties them to certain incentive structures,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're paid by the hour, you do not want fewer hours. So, Schlumberger (who he\u2019d worked with at NASA) sort of challenged me, what would you do about this? I said we need to create a hybrid vehicle. We need to be able to have an AUV turn into an ROV, because we actually don't need an umbilical. It was a flash in the pan idea, and so you know we garnered some investment.\u201d\n\nRadford had also been working with Transocean on some drilling software and they were interested in the idea too; so they had their first investors. Since then, US government contracts, from the Navy, especially, have been a strong driver. It\u2019s meant that, over the past four years, Nauticus has developed and tested a significant amount of technology \u2013 most of which they\u2019ve not been able to publicize, says Radford.\n\n\u201cMy proudest moment was when we did a fully autonomous demonstration and I was taken to the side by our customer and they basically said \u2018that was the most advanced stuff they\u2019d ever seen\u2019. We essentially had an autonomous mission that occurred over about 20 minutes of action where the robot was able to pick up a tool, assess it, figure out a way to operate it, figure out a way where that tool could be operated on. We just put the robot in the water, we hit the on switch and sat watching with cups of coffee and it worked. We were almost crying! It was incredible.\u201d That was two years ago in a test tank environment \u2013 they\u2019ve not been able to share the video, he says.\n\nSince then, testing has been in the real-world, including Lake Travis in Austin, but also coastal areas. \u201cWe have some milestones coming up which will stress that (capability proven two years ago) probably by a factor of 10,\u201d says Radford. The Aquanauts are also getting closer to commercial work. Three (second generation) production Aquanauts are in build at International Submarine Engineering in Vancouver. A couple of them are due to head to the Tau Autonomy Center in Norway to qualify \u201ccertain actions\u201d for a couple customers. One will be doing some pilot work in the Gulf of Mexico in mid-2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy dream is to have a network of Aquanauts and Hydronauts out there working, a whole Navy of them, being controlled by control centers around the world, out there 24/7 doing their thing. That's the core of the business. There's an ocean of opportunity Nicolaus Radford, founder and CEO, Nauticus Robotics. Image courtesy Nauticus\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019ll go out with a lot of autonomous capability under their belts, says Radford. \u201cThat work (with the US Navy) has meant being able to build up thousands of kilometers and hours of dive time on their autonomy software,\u201d says Radford. It\u2019s also meant building a commercial and defense variants of Aquanaut. \u201cThose two platforms are in the water every single day, diving, collecting data, building out behaviors, to deploy to the production systems, so we don't have to wait till they come up the assembly line to build out their usable action. It\u2019s a library we've been building for years now.\u201d\n\nThe offshore pilot with Shell, planned for mid-2023, will focus specifically on testing Aquanaut\u2019s ability to deploy a robotic tool, for carrying out inspections on pipelines. Currently, this tool can only otherwise be placed with an ROV, for which a fully crewed ROV vessel is needed, which \u201cwould be overkill\u201d for the work it\u2019s doing. Part of the qualification work for this tool deployment includes supervised autonomy and tool control using Nauticus\u2019 acoustic communication networking technology.\n\nThis is wrapped in with wider over the horizon communications \u2013 terrestrial and underwater \u2013 to support the ability to operate without an umbilical. While satellite communications are there, the rollout of the likes of Starlink will provide more inexpensive ways to transmit more data to the surface, says Radford. For through-water communications, Nauticus has been working with Schlumberger, from whom Nauticus has licensed use of an underwater modem previously tested from a DriX USV to receive video from an AUV. It\u2019s also been work with Singapore-based Subnero.\n\nSubnero has been developing software defined underwater acoustic modems for communications, networking, navigation and monitoring, which it calls Wireless Networked Communications (WNC). Recent testing with Nauticus has included the ability of their WNC to dynamically adapt to provide the best performance in a given environment.\n\nConcurrently, Nauticus is building, through Diverse Marine in Cowes, UK, an 18 m, aluminum-hulled, SMART-Gyro (from Golden Arrow) stabilized USVs called Hydronaut, which will act as a transport, recharge and communication gateway for Aquanaut. Nauticus has an agreement with Diverse to build 20 Hydronauts, with the first two initially scheduled for completion in Q1 and Q2 2023. The rest are expected to include Jones Act compliant builds via Diverse Marine\u2019s USA-based shipyard partners.\n\n\n\nArtist rendering of the Hydronaut. Image courtesy Nauticus\n\nHydronaut under construction. Image courtesy Nauticus\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hydronauts will have a Guardian Autonomy package from Marine AI, in Plymouth, UK, a launch and recovery system from Kongsberg and through-hull deployment for transducers and other acoustic communications systems. It will be initially flagged to MCA Workboat Code and optionally uncrewed, because \u201cwe don't want to be limited by any regulations,\u201d says Radford (an approach others are also taking with many countries having different regulations), \u201cso it has accommodation for four crew. That will allow it to travel about 160 nautical miles from a safe harbor with its crew.\u201d\n\nThe firm is also commercializing the manipulator it designed for Aquanaut as a standalone product to sell. \u201cBuilding Aquanaut was like a moon shot engineering activity and there was a bunch of spin out technologies that are finding their own independent revenue streams, whether it's the software stack called Toolkit that runs everything or all the way down to just the manipulator,\u201d says Radford. \u201cThere weren\u2019t really any electric manipulators in the market, so we decided to fill that gap made our first delivery to IKM (in Norway).\u201d That\u2019s been through some development work with IKM and now the first production batch has now started, he says.\n\nEarlier this year the firm also agreed to work with Stinger AS, a specialist underwater technology firm, also in Norway. The details of that are being worked on, says Radford. Nauticus also had an agreement with Triumph Subsea, a new company that had announced various plans for a new breed of greener offshore vessels. There is still a contract with them, but delivery dates have been pushed out, he says Radford.\n\nWhile there have been delays \u2013 building the Hydronauts has been hit by delays getting hold of aluminum \u2013 Radford is fired up. \u201cWe are here to make the biggest impact in the ocean economy through the deployment of this robotic navy,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we\u2019ve also transitioned to a public facing entity, we\u2019re on the NASDAQ and everyone here is fired up about it.\u201d\n\nHe also hopes that Nauticus\u2019 investment will be part of a wider surge in investment in the ocean space, which spending has been dwarfed by other sectors, not least space technology. There are also barriers to entry \u2013 the cost to develop ocean technology, for example. But Radford hopes to overcome that, finding both funding and willing partners.\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "In 2008, EA released Visceral Games' Dead Space - a dark sci-fi horror experience that quickly amasssed a following and spawn multiple follow-ups. Fifteen years later, Dead Space lives again thanks to EA Motive. In this full-on remake, Dead Space merges many of the latest innovations in the Frostbite engine with a fresh new coat of paint and overhauled game design - but how much has the game changed and what does the new tech bring? To find out, I've played through the game on PS5, ran through the original on PS3 and spoken to developers David and Phillipe from EA Motive to get some deeper insights into the technology powering the remake. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe original Dead Space comes from an unusual place - it was built from the technology powering the Tiger Woods games between 2000 and 2007 - but of course it's a completely different experience. Beautiful dynamic shadows and moody lighting helped create a memorable and atmospheric journey for players and, perhaps most surprising of all, it managed to run equally well on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a rare feat for that era. Through a modern lens, Dead Space shows its age, but what the team managed to create remains visually striking even now. Since its release, however, technology has evolved significantly - two console generations have passed, and the Frostbite Engine has become the de facto solution for most of EA's studios.\n\nWatch on YouTube Here's the DF tech review of Dead Space (2023) in video form.\n\nAccording to senior producer Philippe Ducharme, the goal from the beginning was to completely rebuild the original Dead Space on the Frostbite Engine while respecting its legacy. While including modern graphics features with vastly improved lighting and atmospherics would be key, one of the driving factors was the push to create a singular, seamless USG Ishimura. Rather than being divided up into sections, the ship can now be explored freely. Technical director David Robillard noted that seamless, fully streamed environments were previously not a strength of the Frostbite Engine, so a lot of people were pulled in to make this feature possible - and sensibly so, as this is something that should benefit future Frostbite games as well.\n\nThe result is that the ship was rebuilt in such a way that it is now physically plausible. The team actually created a gray box version of the Ishimura using the original map assets, in fact, and determined that many aspects of the ship design simply didn't make sense. What this means in practice is that the ship now feels more spacious and logical in its design but still feels true to the original. For example, in the original, the medical centre that appears in chapters two and five are completely separate maps but in the remake, it's all integrated into a singular environment and you experience the map changing as you progress.\n\nYou'll also experience seemingly random attacks as you explore and re-explore areas of the Ishimura, the result of an 'Intensity Director' that ties directly into the new level streaming system. The ship is broken into detached sub-levels, each with its own subdivisions, and level data is streamed in and out based on camera and player position. The rooms the player inhabits have logical meta information tracked by the game, letting the game spin up events from merely rattling a vent all the way to sending swarms of enemies.\n\nof Attribution\n\nTogether, these changes can be stark - for example, we can compare the sequence of events for arriving at the medical centre in the remake versus the 2008 original. In the original, your only option is to take the tram, where you watch a graphic until the next level is loaded in the background. In the remake though, the tram is missing - so you travel through a different, seamless area, gaining access to a new power, kinesis, slightly earlier than you did in the original game. You then eventually arrive at the medical centre - with a doorway now unlocked and the tram available for future journeys. However, the tram never relieves the player of control as it did in the original, so it feels far more seamless. And if you retread this ground, the intensity director ensures that you never quite know what to expect, even in familiar terrain. So even in this small section, the game feels substantially different.\n\nOf course, changes to the game design are one thing, but there's also a visual component. After all, a remake should offer superior graphics and that is indeed the case here. EA Motive has used a wide range of Frostbite features to bring the Ishimura to life, most notably with lighting and materials, which now play a key role in defining the texture of the ship. Physically-based rendering wasn't really a thing in 2008, but it's the standard now and all art assets created for Dead Space benefit. From metallic surfaces to the fleshy tendrils adorning the walls, everything feels more realistic.\n\nAnother important aspect is volumetric lighting - this is a huge departure over the original game which instead relies on billboards positioned to give the impression of volumetrics. With this remake, the team deploys Frostbite's excellent frustum-aligned voxel fog and it's used everywhere - from shafts of light piercing the darkness to low hanging mist nestled along the floor, it's a significant part of the visual makeup.\n\nFurthermore, special consideration was paid to how volumetric lighting bodies react in a zero-G environment, given that the game can transition between the two states. It works pretty well. The developers also revamped the particle system - not only are particles beautifully rendered but they also physically interact with the environment and objects around you, with sparks even bouncing off Isaac's suit, leaving small residual markings across his armor.\n\nVarious visual feature demonstrations: frustum-aligned voxel fog in zero-g, physically-based rendering for organic elements, physically-interactive spark particles, and beams of light interacting with glass surfaces.\n\nThis same approach to physicality also applies to audio - according to Phillipe, a lot of time and effort was poured into audio engineering and creation. Dead Space makes excellent use of surround sound audio, for those with a home theater, including exceptionally rich bass. It also works well with headphones.\n\nThe depiction of shadow is critical in building atmosphere for a horror game and Dead Space certainly delivers on this objective but there\u2019s a catch \u2013 black crush. Essentially, when showing a dim or darkened location, you would optimally want to display these areas with deep shadows \u2013 that is, dark but still lightly visible. For areas bathed in pure darkness, though, a smooth gradient should serve as a transition between light and shadow. The problem with Dead Space is that, no matter how you adjust your settings, there\u2019s a sense that the transition from light to dark is far too aggressive, leaving dark black areas devoid of any detail. This ends up giving the impression of reduced colour depth or a settings mismatch. Even worse, in its current form, the poorly implemented variable rate shading is used more heavily in shadowed areas, so increasing the brightness to restore detail only serves to highlight the VRS issue. This isn\u2019t a deal-breaker by any means but Id like to see more nuance in the gamma curve, allowing more shadow detail to remain visible.\n\nWhat really impressed me, though, is the simulation of sound propagation. When a sound is produced by the game, this sample is processed to simulate the distance, velocity and direction of travel. If a sound plays down a curved hallway, for instance, it will realistically bounce around the environment before being played back, simulating realistic behavior. It makes a huge difference. Furthermore, David noted that they've implemented a system in which sound samples are normalised, similar to how materials are normalised for use in a PBR pipeline, and things like mass, surface and surface contact points are taken into account when the sound is played back to ensure that it respects the physical properties of the world. The takeaway here is that, yes, Dead Space sounds really good.\n\nFurthermore, speaking on visuals again, nearly every light in the game can cast a shadow ensuring a far more coherent presentation and, in quality mode, the game employs Frostbite's ray traced ambient occlusion which adds depths to crevices around the ship. Now, this isn't nearly as robust as the RT mode available in The Callisto Protocol so don't expect a major transformation but it is a nice bonus that does improve overall fidelity. It also means that you can opt for the 60fps performance mode on PS5 or Series X without sacrificing nearly as much in the way of visual quality.\n\nSpeaking of consoles, I did want to touch on image quality and one feature that perhaps doesn't perform as I'd have liked. Xbox Series X and PS5 both offer a 60fps performance mode and a quality mode with RTAO and a frame-rate capped at 30 fps. The game targets 1440p in performance mode and 2160p in quality using FSR2, though we did find much lower pixel counts often thanks to DRS.\n\nQuality mode and performance mode look fairly close, with a higher resolution and RT AO in the quality mode.\n\nThese resolutions are reasonable, but the Variable Rate Shading doesn't work as it should. This feature is designed to save on performance by varying your shading rate dynamically across the frame. Conceptually, the renderer should retain full shading rate for well-lit areas you're likely to focus on, while darker scenes can use a reduced rate with larger blocks. This feature is enforced across every platform but the software VRS solution used specifically on PS5 has a serious problem - it basically ruins image quality. Essentially, darker areas of the image use more extreme VRS, resulting in serious pixelation which seems to scale with the internal rendering resolution. The good news is that the dev team have officially acknowledged the issue and are working on a patch to improve things on console while offering the option to disable VRS entirely on PC.\n\nIf you can't wait for that patch and have a choice, I'd recommend playing on Xbox Series X over PS5 right now. Oliver's piece comparing the three systems against one another will provide more detail when it arrives.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nSo despite the issues with VRS plaguing the launch version, everything else is an example of what a best-in-class remake looks like. Dead Space is absolutely on par with the likes of Capcom's Resident Evil remakes, offering something for fans and newcomers alike. I feel it's particularly worth playing for fans of the original game, as there are a lot of changes to the design despite still adhering to the basic structure. As you play, encounters you may have anticipated don\u2019t happen, items are moved around, and everything feels like it\u2019s playing with your expectations.\n\nVisually speaking, the Dead Space remake doesn't match the heights of The Callisto Protocol, but it's still a handsome game with smooth performance across every console. Ultimately, if you enjoy sci-fi horror, you need to give this one a shot.",

            "text": "It is an exciting time for astronomers and cosmologists. Since the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers have been treated to the most vivid and detailed images of the Universe ever taken. Webb\u2018s powerful infrared imagers, spectrometers, and coronographs will allow for even more in the near future, including everything from surveys of the early Universe to direct imaging studies of exoplanets. Moreover, several next-generation telescopes will become operational in the coming years with 30-meter (~98.5 feet) primary mirrors, adaptive optics, spectrometers, and coronographs.\n\nEven with these impressive instruments, astronomers and cosmologists look forward to an era when even more sophisticated and powerful telescopes are available. For example, Zachary Cordero\n\nof the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recently proposed a telescope with a 100-meter (328-foot) primary mirror that would be autonomously constructed in space and bent into shape by electrostatic actuators. His proposal was one of several concepts selected this year by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program for Phase I development.\n\nCorder is the Boeing Career Development Professor in Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and a member of the Aerospace Materials and Structures Lab (AMSL) and Small Satellite Center. His research integrates his expertise in processing science, mechanics, and design to develop novel materials and structures for emerging aerospace applications. His proposal is the result of a collaboration with Prof. Jeffrey Lang (from MIT\u2019s Electronics and the Microsystems Technology Laboratories) and a team of three students with the AMSL, including Ph.D. student Harsh Girishbhai Bhundiya.\n\nTheir proposed telescope addresses a key issue with space telescopes and other large payloads that are packaged for launch and then deployed in orbit. In short, size and surface precision tradeoffs limit the diameter of deployable space telescopes to the 10s of meters. Consider the recently-launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the largest and most powerful telescope ever sent to space. To fit into its payload fairing (atop an Ariane 5 rocket), the telescope was designed so that it could be folded into a more compact form.\n\nThis included its primary mirror, secondary mirror, and sunshield, which all unfolded once the space telescope was in orbit. Meanwhile, the primary mirror (the most complex and powerful ever deployed) measures 6.5 meters (21 feet) in diameter. Its successor, the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR), will have a similar folding assembly and a primary mirror measuring 8 to 15 meters (26.5 to 49 feet) in diameter \u2013 depending on the selected design (LUVOIR-A or -B). As Bhundiya explained to Universe Today via email:\n\n\u201cToday, most spacecraft antennas are deployed in orbit (e.g., Northrop Grumman\u2019s Astromesh antenna) and have been optimized to achieve high performance and gain. However, they have limitations: 1) They are passive deployable systems. I.e. once you deploy them you cannot adaptively change the shape of the antenna. 2) They become difficult to slew as their size increases. 3) They exhibit a tradeoff between diameter and precision. I.e. their precision decreases as their size increases, which is a challenge for achieving astronomy and sensing applications that require both large diameters and high precision (e.g. JWST).\u201d\n\nWhile many in-space construction methods have been proposed to overcome these limitations, detailed analyses of their performance for building precision structures (like large-diameter reflectors) are lacking. For the sake of their proposal, Cordero and his colleagues conducted a quantitative, system-level comparison of materials and processes for in-space manufacturing. Ultimately, they determined that this limitation could be overcome using advanced materials and a novel in-space manufacturing method called Bend-Forming.\n\nThis technique, invented by researchers at the AMSL and described in a recent paper co-authored by Bhundiya and Cordero, relies on a combination of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) deformation processing and hierarchical high-performance materials. As Harsh explained it:\n\n\u201cBend-Forming is a process for fabricating 3D wireframe structures from metal wire feedstock. It works by bending a single strand of wire at specific nodes and with specific angles, and adding joints to the nodes to make a stiff structure. So to fabricate a given structure, you convert it into bending instructions which can be implemented on a machine like a CNC wire bender to fabricate it from a single strand of feedstock. The key application of Bend-Forming is to manufacture the support structure for a large antenna on orbit. The process is well-suited for this application because it is low-power, can fabricate structures with high compaction ratios, and has essentially no size limit.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to other in-space assembly and manufacturing approaches, Bend-Forming is low-power and is uniquely enabled by the extremely low-temperature environment of space. In addition, this technique enables smart structures that leverage multifunctional materials to achieve new combinations of size, mass, stiffness, and precision. Additionally, the resulting smart structures leverage multifunctional materials to achieve unprecedented combinations of size, mass, stiffness, and precision, breaking the design paradigms that limit conventional truss or tension-aligned space structures.\n\nIn addition to their native precision, Large Bend-Formed structures can use their electrostatic actuators to contour a reflector surface with sub-millimeter precision. This, said Harsh, will increase the precision of their fabricated antenna in orbit:\n\n\u201cThe method of active control is called electrostatic actuation and uses forces generated by electrostatic attraction to precisely shape a metallic mesh into a curved shape which acts as the antenna reflector. We do this by applying a voltage between the mesh and a \u2018command surface\u2019 which consists of the Bend-Formed support structure and deployable electrodes. By adjusting this voltage, we can precisely shape the reflector surface and achieve a high-gain, parabolic antenna.\u201d\n\nAn arrangement of 3 exoplanets to explore how the atmospheres can look different based on the chemistry present and incoming flux. Credit: Jack H. Madden used with permission\n\nHarsh and his colleagues deduce that this technique will allow for a deployable mirror measuring more than 100 meters (328 ft) in diameter that could achieve a surface precision of 100 m/m and a specific area of more than 10 m2/kg. This capability would surpass existing microwave radiometry technology and could lead to significant improvements in storm forecasts and an improved understanding of atmospheric processes like the hydrologic cycle. This would have significant implications for Earth Observation and exoplanet studies.\n\nThe team recently demonstrated a 1-meter (3.3 ft) prototype of an electrostatically-actuated reflector with a Bend-Formed support structure at the 2023 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) SciTech Conference, which ran from January 23rd to 27th in National Harbor, Maryland. With this Phase I NIAC grant, the team plans to mature the technology with the ultimate aim of creating a microwave radiometry reflector.\n\nLooking ahead, the team plans to investigate how Bend-Forming can be used in geostationary orbit (GEO) to create a microwave radiometry reflector with a 15km (9.3 mi) field of view, a ground resolution of 35km (21.75 mi) and a proposed frequency span of 50 to 56 GHz \u2013 the super-high and extremely-high frequent range (SHF/EHF). This will enable the telescope to retrieve temperature profiles from exoplanet atmospheres, a key characteristic allowing astrobiologists to measure habitability.\n\n\u201cOur goal with the NIAC now is to work towards implementing our technology of Bend-Forming and electrostatic actuation in space,\u201d said Harsh. \u201cWe envision fabricating 100-m diameter antennas in geostationary orbit with have Bend-Formed support structure and electrostatically-actuated reflector surfaces. These antennas will enable a new generation of spacecraft with increased sensing, communication, and power capabilities.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading: NASA",

            "text": "A forthcoming NASA telescope that will observe Earth from space has been renamed in honor of the late visionary scientist and inventor George R. Carruthers.\n\nThe telescope, previously known as the Global Lyman-alpha Imager of the Dynamic Exosphere (GLIDE) mission, is now called the Carruthers Geocorona Observatory.\n\nAmong other achievements, Carruthers was responsible for the creation of the compact and powerful gold-plated Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph telescope that was placed on the moon as part of the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. The mission was renamed in December at an event held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where Carruthers earned his bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in the 1960s, according to a NASA statement .\n\nRelated: Apollo 16: NASA's 5th crewed moon landing in pictures\n\nGeorge Carruthers, right, and William Conway, left, examine the golden-hued Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph, which would become the first moon-based observatory. (Image credit: U.S. Naval Research Laboratory)\n\nThe aim of the Carruthers Geocorona Observatory, set to launch in 2025, is to capture light from an outer area of Earth's atmosphere called the geocorona. This belt of ionized hydrogen surrounds our planet at the limit of the exosphere, the outermost layer of our planet\u2019s atmosphere, and is seen primarily in far-ultraviolet light.\n\nBy doing this, the telescope will be the first mission dedicated to charting changes in the geocorona and could help scientists answer basic questions about the characteristics of the exosphere \u2014 such as its size, shape and density \u2014 and potentially indicate how it changes over time.\n\nStretching far above Earth's clouds, the exosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen that originates from methane and water in Earth's oceans. The exosphere has an important role in Earth's response to space weather driven by outflows from the sun , like the solar wind , when they strike Earth's magnetosphere . These conditions can have a major impact on space-based technology around Earth, as well as affect power and communication infrastructure on the planet's surface.\n\nAn image of Earth taken by the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph, designed and built by George R. Carruthers. (Image credit: G. Carruthers (NRL) et al./Far UV Camera/NASA/Apollo 16)\n\nThe influence the geocorona has on the exosphere means the Carruthers Geocorona Observatory's observations of the geocorona could help us better understand and predict how solar activity will influence technology.\n\nThe Carruthers Geocorona Observatory is a fitting mission to take Carruthers' name, as the scientist's moon-based gold-plated telescope was the first instrument to capture images of Earth's geocorona from space.\n\nThe telescope passed its initial mission review in January 2021, less than a month after Carruthers died.\n\nFollowing its launch, the Carruthers Geocorona Observatory will be located at a point of gravitational balance between Earth and the sun known as Lagrange Point 1, around 1 million miles (1.6 million km) from Earth's surface. This location will grant the telescope the ideal vantage point to observe the entire exosphere and the molecules leaking from Earth's atmosphere into space.\n\nThis means the data collected by the Carruthers Geocorona Observatory also could shed light on how planets hold on to their atmospheres and thus improve our understanding of planetary habitability and our search for life elsewhere in the galaxy.",

            "summary": "\nNASA has renamed its Global Lyman-alpha Imager of the Dynamic Exosphere (GLIDE) mission to the Carruthers Geocorona Observatory in honor of late scientist and inventor George R. Carruthers. The telescope, set to launch in 2025, will observe Earth's geocorona from Lagrange Point 1 near the moon and could help us better understand how solar activity affects our planet as well as improve our understanding of planetary habitability and search for life elsewhere in the galaxy."
