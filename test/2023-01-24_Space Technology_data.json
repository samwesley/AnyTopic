The goal is to use the technology to send human-crewed missions to Mars, which the space agency is hoping to achieve during the 2030s.\n\n\u201cWith the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in announcing(Opens in a new window) the partnership.\n\nCurrent spacecraft rely on chemical propellant, such as liquid hydrogen and hydrazine, to take off from the planet and then maneuver in space. On the downside, this means the craft has to carry loads of fuel during the transit. A nuclear-powered propulsion system, on the other hand, promises to increase the energy efficiency by two to five times, according to NASA, while reducing the transit time for the astronauts on board.\n\n\u201cIn a nuclear thermal rocket engine, a fission reactor is used to generate extremely high temperatures. The engine transfers the heat produced by the reactor to a liquid propellant, which is expanded and exhausted through a nozzle to propel the spacecraft,\u201d NASA added.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement means NASA is joining DARPA\u2019s existing program to create and demonstrate a nuclear-powered rocket in space. The program, dubbed DRACO, has already been contracting with companies, including Blue Origin, to submit design proposals.\n\n\u201cUnder the agreement(Opens in a new window), NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) will lead technical development of the nuclear thermal engine to be integrated with DARPA\u2019s experimental spacecraft,\u201d the space agency said. Meanwhile, DARPA will have the authority to contract out building the nuclear-powered craft and engine to private companies. The defense agency will also have final say on the experimental spacecraft that\u2019ll ride the nuclear-powered rocket.\n\n\u201cThis partnership will take us one step closer as we dare to explore the unknown,\u201d Nelson added. \u201cLet us dare to ignite the future farther, faster, together.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, private company SpaceX has decided to stick with chemical fuel for its own Starship craft, which is being designed for missions to both the Moon and Mars.",

Image courtesy of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n\nJan. 24 (UPI) -- NASA is partnering with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to demonstrate the use of a nuclear thermal rocket engine in space, the two agencies announced in a statement Tuesday. The two hope the mutually-beneficial arrangement will eventually lead to faster, safer space missions, powered by nuclear technology. Advertisement\n\nThe test could occur as early as 2027.\n\nDARPA falls under command of the U.S. Department of Defense, and is responsible for developing new and emerging technologies.\n\nThe Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations, or DRACO, is meant to speed up development and define roles as both agencies look to a future that includes nuclear-powered rockets.\n\nThe United States last conducted a nuclear thermal rocket engine test more than 50 years ago. Those were conducted as part of NASA's then Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application and Rover projects.\n\nNASA said Tuesday it hopes the new test will eventually allow it to more quickly achieve objectives for its return to the moon's surface, as well as future missions to Mars.\n\n\"DARPA and NASA have a long history of fruitful collaboration in advancing technologies for our respective goals, from the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the moon for the first time to robotic servicing and refueling of satellites,\" DARPA director Dr. Stefanie Tompkins said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The space domain is critical to modern commerce, scientific discovery, and national security. The ability to accomplish leap-ahead advances in space technology through the DRACO nuclear thermal rocket program will be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting material to the moon and eventually, people to Mars.\"\n\nThe overall program is being led by DARPA. However, NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate will take the lead when it comes to developing the nuclear thermal engine. That engine will eventually be fitted aboard an experimental spacecraft, produced by DARPA.\n\nRELATED NASA delays Rocket Lab launch in Virginia until Tuesday\n\n\"Recent aerospace materials and engineering advancements are enabling a new era for space nuclear technology, and this flight demonstration will be a major achievement toward establishing a space transportation capability for an Earth-moon economy,\" NASA STMD director Jim Reuter said in a statement.\n\nIn 2021, DARPA awarded three contracts as part of a separate nuclear thermal propulsion system. That system is expected to operate in low Earth orbit in 2025.",

            "text": "UCLA physicists have developed a new method to understand space weather that only requires a 3cm glass sphere.\n\nIn their new study, the researcher employed the glass sphere to recreate the type of gravity on or near stars and other planets. Recreating these conditions may help mitigate the effects of space weather, safeguard humans and equipment during space missions, and ensure that satellites function.\n\nWhy is space weather so dangerous?\n\nSpace weather, such as solar flares, can cause havoc with space missions, telecommunications, and other types of Earth-orbiting satellites. For example, 40 SpaceX satellites were knocked out by a solar storm last year, and the phenomenon can also cause problems for military technology, as the formation of turbulent plasma around hypersonic missiles can interfere with weapons systems\u2019 communications.\n\nResearchers have been inhibited in their pursuit to overcome these challenges because the experiments they perform in laboratories on Earth are impacted by gravity in ways that are different to space conditions. The team\u2019s glass sphere innovation can overcome these gravity issues in experiments intended to model convection that occurs in stars and other planets.\n\nSeth Putterman, a UCLA physics professor and the study\u2019s senior author, explained: \u201cPeople were so interested in trying to model spherical convection with laboratory experiments that they actually put an experiment in the space shuttle because they couldn\u2019t get a strong enough central force field on the ground.\n\n\u201cWhat we showed is that our system of microwave-generated sound produced gravity so strong that Earth\u2019s gravity wasn\u2019t a factor. We don\u2019t need to go into space to do these experiments anymore.\u201d\n\nHow does the glass sphere work?\n\nThe team utilised microwaves to heat sulphur gas to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit inside the glass sphere. The resulting sound waves in the sphere act like gravity, restricting the movement of the hot, weakly ionised gas (plasma) into patterns that resemble the currents of plasma in stars.\n\nJohn Koulakis, a UCLA project scientist and the study\u2019s first author, explained: \u201cSound fields act like gravity, at least when it comes to driving convection in gas. With microwave-generated sound in a spherical flask of hot plasma, we achieved a gravity field that is 1,000 times stronger than Earth\u2019s gravity.\u201d\n\nHot gas rises on Earth because gravity holds denser and colder gas closer to the planet\u2019s core. The team discovered that hot, bright gas near the outer half of the sphere also moved outward toward the sphere\u2019s walls. This robust, continuous gravity generated turbulence similar to that near the Sun\u2019s surface.\n\nIn the inner half of the sphere, acoustic gravity altered the direction and pointed outward, causing hot gas to sink to the centre. In the experiment, acoustic gravity held the hottest plasma at the sphere\u2019s centre \u2013 the same place it occurs in stars.\n\nUnderstanding how to control and manipulate plasma similarly to solar and planetary convection will enable experts to understand and predict space weather effects on spacecraft and satellite communications systems.\n\nThe team plans to scale up the experiment to replicate conditions better so they can observe the space weather phenomenon in more detail and for extended periods.\n\n\n\n",

Nuclear thermal propulsion technology could be used for future NASA crewed missions to Mars.\n\nNASA wants to design and demonstrate a working nuclear thermal rocket by 2027.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson introduced the project on Tuesday (Jan. 24) during a presentation at the 2023 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) SciTech Forum and Exposition held in National Harbor, Maryland. Nelson said that the agency will partner with the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in order to \"develop and demonstrate advanced nuclear thermal propulsion, a revolutionary technology that will allow the United States to expand the possibilities for future human spaceflight missions.\"\n\nUnder the agreement, NASA will join DARPA's Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations, or DRACO, a program that began in 2021 . The program seeks to develop a nuclear thermal engine that will be used by an experimental spacecraft designed by DARPA. DARPA will develop the nuclear reactor and engine for this nuclear rocket, which the agency and NASA hope to fly in an in-space demonstration as early as 2027. Nelson called the partnership an \"exciting investment in the future of human space exploration\" and \"a major investment in getting to Mars.\"\n\nRelated: US military wants nuclear rocket ideas for missions near the moon\n\n\"DRACO will be a critical part of evaluating the technologies that will take us deeper into the solar system,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said during the presentation. \"Our intent is to lead and develop a blueprint for human exploration and sustained presence throughout the solar system. That is a very important goal. And we think that these advanced technologies will be a critical part of it.\"\n\nNASA and DARPA released an interagency agreement (opens in new tab) outlining the roles and responsibilities of each agency; the agreement grants NASA final authority over the nuclear thermal rocket engine's development and fabrication. However, the agreement grants DARPA authority over the \"experimental NTR vehicle (X-NTRV),\" the spacecraft that will be powered by the planned nuclear rocket engine, and DARPA will be responsible for operating and disposing of the X-NTRV in orbit.\n\n\"NASA has a long history of collaborating with DARPA on projects that enable our respective missions, such as in-space servicing,\" Melroy said. \"Expanding our partnership to nuclear propulsion will help drive forward NASA's goal to send humans to Mars.\"\n\nThis vision for a nuclear rocket dates back decades (opens in new tab). NASA's Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application, or NERVA program , sought to launch a crewed Mars mission in 1979 powered by a nuclear rocket. The program was canceled in 1972 due to budget cuts and worries of escalating the Cold War.\n\nSending humans to Mars has become one of the primary spaceflight goals of government space agencies and private spaceflight firms alike. NASA's Artemis program is part of the agency's \" Moon to Mars \" vision that will leverage what NASA will learn from its planned lunar exploration to work toward establishing a human presence on the Red Planet .\n\nSpaceX, meanwhile, says it will soon launch orbital flight of its Starship vehicle that the company plans on eventually landing on Mars; other private space companies are working to beat that goal .",

Engineers do not yet know how much time could be shaved off using nuclear technology, but Bill Nelson, the Nasa administrator, said it would allow spacecraft, and humans, to travel in deep space at record speed.\n\n\u201cWith the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever - a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nNuclear electric propulsion systems use propellants much more efficiently than chemical rockets but provide a low amount of thrust, the agency says.\n\nA reactor generates electricity that positively charges gas propellants like xenon or krypton, pushing the ions out through a thruster, which drives the spacecraft forward.\n\nUsing low thrust efficiently, nuclear electric propulsion systems accelerate spacecraft for extended periods and can propel a Mars mission for a fraction of the propellant of high-thrust systems.\n\nIn a statement, Darpa\u2019s director, Dr Stefanie Tompkins, said the agreement was an extension of existing collaboration between the agencies.\n\n\u201cDarpa and Nasa have a long history of fruitful collaboration in advancing technologies for our respective goals, from the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the moon for the first time to robotic servicing and refueling of satellites,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe space domain is critical to modern commerce, scientific discovery and national security. The ability to accomplish leap-ahead advances in space technology\u2026 will be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting material to the moon and, eventually, people to Mars.\u201d\n\nNasa\u2019s Artemis 2 mission, which will send humans around the moon for the first time in more than half a century, is scheduled for 2024. The subsequent Artemis 3 mission, which could come the following year, will land astronauts, including the first woman, on the moon\u2019s surface for the first time since 1972.",

            "text": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Thales Alenia Space has signed a contract to develop quantum technologies in another push by the European Space Agency (ESA) to use the behavior of subatomic particles to make communications more secure.\n\nThe European satellite maker said Jan. 23 it is leading a consortium called TeQuantS, which aims to develop technologies needed to demonstrate quantum communication links from space in three years.\n\nBy using the entanglement properties of photons, these links are intended to be more secure than conventional networks because any attempt to intercept them would change their state.\n\nTerrestrial quantum communication networks using fiber optic cables are limited to about 150 kilometers, according to Thales, and satellites are better suited for using these capabilities over longer distances.\n\nAccording to Chinese state media, the Micius satellite China launched in 2016 was the first quantum-enabled spacecraft.\n\nNASA and startups including Singapore\u2019s SpeQtral are also exploring space-based quantum capabilities to protect communications from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, such as by quantum computers.\n\nThe overall contract ESA awarded TeQuantS is worth around 10 million euros ($11 million), said Mathias Vanden Bossche, director of research, technology and product policy at Thales Alenia Space.\n\nThat covers a first phase lasting 12 months, Bossche told SpaceNews via email, to start technology qualifications that could lead to a potential demonstration in 2026.\n\nIt is part of ESA\u2019s multi-pronged approach to advance quantum communications technology, notably under a framework called EuroQCI (European Quantum Communication Infrastructure.)\n\nTwo groups have secured contracts under the EuroQCI framework to study quantum communication architectures: One led by Airbus and another by German telco Deutsche Telekom.\n\nEuroQCI covers many projects ranging from ground to space segments. The main objective is to define the overall architecture of quantum-based networks and set up terrestrial test beds.\n\nTeQuantS is focusing on technology developments for the space segment, Bossche said, and targets a wider scope than EuroQCI.\n\nAnd unlike an ESA project led by satellite operator SES aiming to develop a satellite to test the distribution of quantum encryption keys for cryptography, he said TeQuantS will also study ways to connect quantum computers and quantum sensors in a multipurpose network.\n\nWhile quantum key distribution (QKD) is important for security, he said generic networks will need to be able to support the many applications and greater performance promised by quantum information networking\n\n\u201cThese generic networks are the real at-stake and challenge of quantum communications,\u201d Bossche added.\n\n\u201cOverall, the Thales Alenia Space project is the first project that addresses quantum information networks in space.\u201d\n\nThe TeQuantS consortium comprises Airbus, seven smaller firms and startups, and two research laboratories.",

The non-reimbursable agreement, designed to benefit both agencies, outlines roles, responsibilities, and processes aimed at speeding up development efforts.\n\nCaption: Artist concept of Demonstration for Rocket to Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) spacecraft, which will demonstrate a nuclear thermal rocket engine. Nuclear thermal propulsion technology could be used for future NASA crewed missions to Mars. Credit: DARPA\n\n\"NASA will work with our long-term partner, DARPA, to develop and demonstrate advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology as soon as 2027. With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever \u2013 a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Congratulations to both NASA and DARPA on this exciting investment, as we ignite the future, together.\"\n\nUsing a nuclear thermal rocket allows for faster transit time, reducing risk for astronauts. Reducing transit time is a key component for human missions to Mars, as longer trips require more supplies and more robust systems. Maturing faster, more efficient transportation technology will help NASA meet its Moon to Mars Objectives.\n\nOther benefits to space travel include increased science payload capacity and higher power for instrumentation and communication. In a nuclear thermal rocket engine, a fission reactor is used to generate extremely high temperatures. The engine transfers the heat produced by the reactor to a liquid propellant, which is expanded and exhausted through a nozzle to propel the spacecraft. Nuclear thermal rockets can be three or more times more efficient than conventional chemical propulsion.\n\n\"NASA has a long history of collaborating with DARPA on projects that enable our respective missions, such as in-space servicing,\" said NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. \"Expanding our partnership to nuclear propulsion will help drive forward NASA's goal to send humans to Mars.\"\n\nUnder the agreement, NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) will lead technical development of the nuclear thermal engine to be integrated with DARPA's experimental spacecraft. DARPA is acting as the contracting authority for the development of the entire stage and the engine, which includes the reactor. DARPA will lead the overall program including rocket systems integration and procurement, approvals, scheduling, and security, cover safety and liability, and ensure overall assembly and integration of the engine with the spacecraft. Over the course of the development, NASA and DARPA will collaborate on assembly of the engine before the in-space demonstration as early as 2027.\n\n\"DARPA and NASA have a long history of fruitful collaboration in advancing technologies for our respective goals, from the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the Moon for the first time to robotic servicing and refueling of satellites,\" said Dr. Stefanie Tompkins, director, DARPA. \"The space domain is critical to modern commerce, scientific discovery, and national security. The ability to accomplish leap-ahead advances in space technology through the DRACO nuclear thermal rocket program will be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting material to the Moon and eventually, people to Mars.\"\n\nThe last nuclear thermal rocket engine tests conducted by the United States occurred more than 50 years ago under NASA's Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application and Rover projects.\n\n\"With this collaboration, we will leverage our expertise gained from many previous space nuclear power and propulsion projects,\" said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for STMD. \"Recent aerospace materials and engineering advancements are enabling a new era for space nuclear technology, and this flight demonstration will be a major achievement toward establishing a space transportation capability for an Earth-Moon economy.\"\n\nNASA, the Department of Energy (DOE), and industry are also developing advanced space nuclear technologies for multiple initiatives to harness power for space exploration. Through NASA's Fission Surface Power project, DOE awarded three commercial design efforts to develop nuclear power plant concepts that could be used on the surface of the Moon and, later, Mars.\n\nNASA and DOE are working another commercial design effort to advance higher temperature fission fuels and reactor designs as part of a nuclear thermal propulsion engine. These design efforts are still under development to support a longer-range goal for increased engine performance and will not be used for the DRACO engine.\n\nTo learn more about STMD, please visit:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/spacetech\n\nSOURCE NASA",

            "text": "A year before Orbit Fab completed tests on the International Space Station (ISS) for hardware designed to refuel spacecraft in orbit, Furphy\u2014as the project is dubbed\u2014was a napkin sketch, and the company was only months old.\n\nIt was 2018 and Orbit Fab was a startup with high hopes. The company had ambitions to build an in-space propellant supply chain: Gas Stations in Space\u2122. They knew in-orbit refueling would extend the life of satellites and provide more flexibility to the industry, thus creating a more sustainable space-based economy. But first, they needed to test their hardware in space\u2014and the ISS National Laboratory provided the perfect platform to do it.\n\nFurphy was designed to be Orbit Fab\u2019s first in-space refueling demonstration and a chance to show the space industry that the company could back its futuristic vision with real hardware. After submitting an ISS National Lab proposal and being awarded a flight project in the summer of 2018, the company handed over hardware for a December launch on SpaceX\u2019s 16th Commercial Resupply Services mission just four and a half months later. The napkin sketch became a reality with the speed that the company has come to be known for, thanks to working with the ISS National Lab, said Orbit Fab co-founder and chief development officer Jeremy Schiel, who co-led the Furphy project.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there\u2019s no flexibility in the industry\u2014you build a satellite for single use, and it cannot deviate from that, primarily because it runs out of fuel,\u201d Schiel said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re fundamentally changing the entire industry.\u201d\n\nOrbit Fab\u2019s investigation on the ISS was essential to understanding tank dynamics and pump systems in the microgravity environment where the technology must perform, an impossible task on Earth, Schiel said. Through the Furphy project, Orbit Fab successfully validated its technology. It showed the space industry that the company is a real contender to become the propellant supplier and refueling servicer in space.\n\nResults provided Orbit Fab with proof-of-concept data to show investors, stakeholders, and potential customers, said James Bultitude, Orbit Fab\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cIt enabled us to fly a real space mission and get real scientific results far faster than anything else we could have done on the ground,\u201d he said. Since completing the Furphy project, Orbit Fab has gone on to develop in-space refueling technology that is now commercially available.\n\nExploring the Business Potential of In-Orbit Refueling\n\nBefore Orbit Fab was founded in January of 2018, Schiel and Daniel Faber, co-founder and CEO, went to various companies within the space industry and asked a simple question: What could you do with an extra tank of fuel? The response was overwhelming, according to Schiel. \u201cWe heard that many companies would see a huge increase in revenue just by having an extra kilogram of propellant in orbit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, after talking with several potential customers, we knew there was a business here.\u201d\n\nJames Bultitude, Orbit Fab\u2019s chief technology officer, performs final cleaning and inspections of the rigid tanker during hardware handover to NASA before its flight to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-16. Media Credit: Image courtesy of Orbit Fab\n\nAt the center of Orbit Fab\u2019s mission is the idea that a robust space-based economy requires sustainable in-orbit fueling capabilities. The company\u2019s vision for the future of space is comparable to what happened on Earth when the world went from steam engines to oil and gas readily available to industry: the global shipping economy\u2019s worth went from the millions to trillions within a century.\n\n\u201cThat was all unlocked because people had fuel to move goods and services around,\u201d Schiel said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the same thing for space.\u201d\n\nHowever, in space, fuel systems operate much differently than on the ground. On Earth, gravity forces fuel to the bottom of a car\u2019s fuel tank while a pump pushes it through the fuel pipeline to the engine. Space is a different story: liquid propellants float inside tanks and act more unpredictably. Pumps and tanks in space must be designed to deal with these difficulties.\n\nOrbit Fab was up to the challenge and developed a pump system to move propellent between a refueling depot and spacecraft. The company also designed fuel tanks with internal baffling (panels that direct flow and help prevent sloshing) to reduce motion from liquid flow. However, the technology needed to be tested in space to ensure it worked as designed. Through the Furphy project on the ISS, Orbit Fab could test its technology and analyze pump and tank dynamics during refueling in a microgravity environment.\n\nOpening a New Frontier The name \u201cFurphy\u201d was inspired by an Australian mobile water tank at the turn of the 20th century with the same name. The original Furphy water tank was transported via a horse-drawn cart and helped to open a new frontier in Australia\u2014much like Orbit Fab plans to do with fuel and the space frontier.\n\nOrbit Fab\u2019s tests on the ISS used water, but the same technology could support a wide range of propellants for spacecraft thrusters, said Bultitude. This could include common propellants like hydrazine and \u201cgreen\u201d alternatives like high test peroxide, which Orbit Fab plans to manufacture by the end of its first decade as a company.\n\nTaking Furphy to Space\n\nFor the Furphy project, a rigid tanker the size of a 12U CubeSat (a class of nanosatellites about 20 cm by 34 cm) was filled with three gallons of water and sent to the ISS. Orbit Fab also sent an empty and compressed FlexTank\u2122 made from silicone elastomer, which expands as it is filled in space. Because the project included a rigid tank filled with liquid, it was considered a hazardous payload, and the company worked day and night to ensure the investigation launched safely.\n\nOnce the payload was onboard the ISS, NASA astronaut Christina Koch tested the pump system\u2019s ability to transfer liquid between the tanker and FlexTank\u2122 and the ability of the FlexTank\u2122 to expand in microgravity. The test was successful, and Orbit Fab demonstrated liquid transfer between the two tanks in space.\n\nNASA astronaut Christina Koch spins FlexTank\u2122 during tests onboard the ISS in 2019. Media Credit: Image courtesy of Orbit Fab\n\nThe Furphy project also tested how tanks refueled in space are affected by propellant loads at various levels. To do this, Orbit Fab examined the dynamics of the tanker and FlexTank\u2122 when filled with different amounts of liquid (full, half-full, a quarter-full, etc.). For each liquid level, Koch would spin the tanker, then stop it and release it to observe the tanker\u2019s behavior. Koch did the same with the FlexTank\u2122. This allowed Orbit Fab to test how well the internal baffling in the tanks reduced sloshing and residual momentum. After all the tests were complete, the water in the tanker was transferred into the space station\u2019s water supply\u2014the first time a private company had supplied the ISS with water.\n\nWhile the pumps worked well during testing with no leaks detected, and the liquid inside the tanks behaved similarly to what the company predicted, there were a few issues that Orbit Fab discovered in microgravity. The tests revealed some faults with the pump and electrical designs.\n\n\u201cWe made some design mistakes that we immediately went about correcting, which was really awesome,\u201d Bultitude said. \u201cWe had a wire that shorted on the ISS, but we managed to figure out why, and overnight, we replicated the problem on the ground and modified our engineering to remedy it.\u201d\n\nThrough successful testing on the ISS, Orbit Fab advanced the technology readiness level (TRL) of its pump system and tanks from TRL-4 to TRL-8, moving the technology closer to commercialization.\n\nMaking Big Space Industry Moves\n\nFurphy\u2019s results continue to inform the company\u2019s engineering of future in-space tankers that will enable the refueling of satellites in orbit. With the experience and lessons gained from the project, Orbit Fab is on its way to manifesting its vision: a robust, sustainable economy in space that runs on fuel supplied by the company\u2019s fuel depots and fuel shuttles. Fuel depots are big, simple satellites full of propellants. Fuel shuttles are complex satellites that will act as servicers to pick up fuel from the depot and deliver it to the customer\u2019s spacecraft.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re not just a fuel supply chain,\u201d Schiel said. \u201cWe are a refueling service on top of the supply chain.\u201d\n\nThe company has already developed the first-ever commercially available in-space fueling port (branded RAFTI\u2122) and the first-ever operational propellant depot in low Earth orbit (LEO), Tanker-001 Tenzing. Orbit Fab\u2019s first two GEO (geosynchronous Earth orbit) fuel shuttles will be commissioned in 2023. By providing robust refueling services in space, thereby increasing the flexibility and value of satellites, Orbit Fab is making it possible for other satellite servicing companies to perform additional maintenance tasks that further optimize satellite performance and lifespan, such as attitude control, momentum management, and relocation.\n\nThe FlexTank\u2122 and rigid tank are shown here during a final connection test before launching to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-16 in 2019. Media Credit: Image courtesy of Orbit Fab\n\n\u201cWe helped open up the space infrastructure to refueling and servicing,\u201d Schiel said. \u201cWhen we started this business, there were eight satellite servicing companies. Now there are more than 100 globally.\u201d\n\nIn January 2022, Orbit Fab obtained its first customer. Astroscale, a company developing innovative in-orbit servicing solutions across all orbits, signed an agreement to refuel the company\u2019s LEXI (Life Extension In-Orbit) Servicer spacecraft; making LEXI the world\u2019s first operational commercial satellite designed to be refueled. The LEXI Servicer is expected to launch to GEO by 2026, where it will perform life extension and other services for various customers. The RAFTI\u2122 interface will make refueling the LEXI Servicer possible as Astroscale engineers the spacecraft\u2019s rendezvous and docking technology to allow LEXI to dock with Orbit Fab\u2019s refueling depots and shuttles.\n\n\u201cThink of RAFTI\u2122 as the gas cap and interface when you refill your car,\u201d said Carolyn Belle, director of advanced systems at Astroscale. \u201cThis partnership for refueling allows us to get more use out of LEXI, just like we are helping our customers get more use out of their spacecraft.\u201d\n\nOrbit Fab\u2019s GEO fuel shuttle will resupply Astroscale\u2019s fleet of LEXI Servicers with up to 1,000 kilograms of propellant. Schiel said Orbit Fab plans to deploy dozens of fuel tankers and shuttles in the next five to 10 years, positioning the company to refuel customer satellites in LEO, GEO, and cislunar space (the region of space from the Earth to the Moon). The plan is to be able to transfer fuel from tankers directly to operational satellites, which will be much more sustainable for several reasons, including reducing the number of fuel shuttles needed, according to Belle.\n\n\u201cWe will not have to build new servicing spacecraft every time one runs out of fuel,\u201d Belle said. \u201cWe also will have to launch fewer additional spacecraft, which saves on emissions and resources.\u201d\n\nAnd while in-orbit refueling is something that people have been interested in for a long time, no one pushed the technology and space-industry-related national and international policy forward to make it happen until Orbit Fab came along, Belle said. \u201cNow, we have companies like Orbit Fab stepping up to say they want to do the hard work to make this possible.\u201d",

            "text": "nuclear thermal rocket engine\n\nNASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced Tuesday a collaboration to demonstrate a nuclear thermal rocket engine in space, an enabling capability for NASA crewed missions to Mars.\n\nNASA and DARPA will partner on the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations, or DRACO, program. The non-reimbursable agreement designed to benefit both agencies, outlines roles, responsibilities, and processes aimed at speeding up development efforts.\n\n\u201cNASA will work with our long-term partner, DARPA, to develop and demonstrate advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology as soon as 2027. With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever \u2013 a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \u201cCongratulations to both NASA and DARPA on this exciting investment, as we ignite the future, together.\u201d\n\nUsing a nuclear thermal rocket allows for faster transit time, reducing risk for astronauts. Reducing transit time is a key component human missions to Mars, as longer trips require more supplies and more robust systems. Maturing faster, more efficient transportation technology will help NASA meet its Moon to Mars Objectives.\n\nOther benefits to space travel include increased science payload capacity and higher power for instrumentation and communication. In a nuclear thermal rocket engine, a fission reactor is used to generate extremely high temperatures. The engine transfers the heat produced by the reactor to a liquid propellant, which is expanded and exhausted through a nozzle to propel the spacecraft. Nuclear thermal rockets can be three or more times more efficient than conventional chemical propulsion.\n\n\u201cNASA has a long history of collaborating with DARPA on projects that enable our respective missions, such as in-space servicing,\u201d said NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. \u201cExpanding our partnership to nuclear propulsion will help drive forward NASA\u2019s goal to send humans to Mars.\u201d\n\nUnder the agreement, NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) will lead technical development of the nuclear thermal engine to be integrated with DARPA\u2019s experimental spacecraft. DARPA is acting as the contracting authority for the development of the entire stage and the engine, which includes the reactor. DARPA will lead the overall program including rocket systems integration and procurement, approvals, scheduling, and security, cover safety and liability, and ensure overall assembly and integration of the engine with the spacecraft. Over the course of the development, NASA and DARPA will collaborate on assembly of the engine before the in-space demonstration as early as 2027.\n\n\u201cDARPA and NASA have a long history of fruitful collaboration in advancing technologies for our respective goals, from the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the Moon for the first time to robotic servicing and refueling of satellites,\u201d said Dr. Stefanie Tompkins, director, DARPA. \u201cThe space domain is critical to modern commerce, scientific discovery, and national security. The ability to accomplish leap-ahead advances in space technology through the DRACO nuclear thermal rocket program will be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting material to the Moon and eventually, people to Mars.\u201d\n\nThe last nuclear thermal rocket engine tests conducted by the United States occurred more than 50 years ago under NASA\u2019s Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application and Rover projects.\n\n\u201cWith this collaboration, we will leverage our expertise gained from many previous space nuclear power and propulsion projects,\u201d said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for STMD. \u201cRecent aerospace materials and engineering advancements are enabling a new era for space nuclear technology, and this flight demonstration will be a major achievement toward establishing a space transportation capability for an Earth-Moon economy.\u201d\n\nNASA, the Department of Energy (DOE), and industry are also developing advanced space nuclear technologies for multiple initiatives to harness power for space exploration. Through NASA\u2019s Fission Surface Power project, DOE awarded three commercial design efforts to develop nuclear power plant concepts that could be used on the surface of the Moon and, later, Mars.\n\nNASA and DOE are working another commercial design effort to advance higher temperature fission fuels and reactor designs as part of a nuclear thermal propulsion engine. These design efforts are still under development to support a longer-range goal for increased engine performance and will not be used for the DRACO engine.\n\nTo learn more about STMD, please visit: https://www.nasa.gov/spacetech",

            "text": "PROJECT\n\nMulti-star Wavefront Control (MSWC)\n\nSNAPSHOT\n\nMulti-star wavefront control technology enables imaging planets in systems with multiple suns (such as Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to us) and searching them for signs of life.\n\nIn 1990, at the behest of Carl Sagan, the Voyager mission took a photo of Earth from 3.7 billion miles away (image at left). The next challenge is to take a similar image of an Earth-like planet orbiting another star. MSWC technology could enable images of multi-star systems such as Alpha Centauri (simulated image on the right; image credit: J. Males, University of Arizona), the nearest star system to the Sun that could potentially host such planets.\n\nFor millennia, people have wondered if life exists elsewhere in the universe. To answer this question, we need to directly image exoplanets (planets orbiting stars other than the Sun) and search them for signs of life. Many nearby stars, however, reside in multi-star systems (i.e., systems with more than one star). In fact, Sun-like stars are more likely to be in multi-star systems\u2014such as Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Sun\u2014than be single stars like our Sun. Therefore, to detect life we will likely need to image exoplanets in these multi-star systems. A newly developed technology, Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC), provides just this kind of capability.\n\nPlanets are much dimmer than stars and typically light from nearby stars must be suppressed to image them. Broadly speaking, instruments that suppress starlight inside the telescope are called coronagraphs and those that do it externally are called starshades.\n\nNASA\u2019s next flagship telescope will be the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, scheduled to launch by May 2027, and will include a technology demonstration of a coronagraphic instrument capable of imaging large planets near their host stars. NASA is also embarking on the development of the next flagship after Roman, provisionally named the \u201cHabitable Worlds Observatory.\u201d Recommended by the 2020 Decadal Survey in Astronomy and Astrophysics, this flagship will address the guidance to identify at least 25 Earth-like planets and characterize them for evidence of life. In addition, NASA may select smaller missions that support the objective of discovering and characterizing habitable planets.\n\nAlthough binary stars are scientifically a very attractive class of targets for such missions (especially Alpha Centauri), they present a technical challenge because light from both stars needs to be suppressed to image any nearby planets. Using a combination of a coronagraph and/or starshade to suppress light from each star is not optimal because of the added cost and risk. In addition, current coronagraphic systems can suppress starlight around an individual star, but cannot suppress the cross-contamination of starlight between stars. Eliminating this cross-contamination is the key challenge that must be overcome to image planets around binary star systems.\n\nMulti-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) was developed to address this challenge. Invented at NASA Ames in 2014, it relies on two innovations that work together. The first is a way to control a deformable mirror (DM) to suppress light from two stars independently. This is done by using two different sets of shapes (spatial frequency modes) on the DM for different stars. The second technique, called \u201csuper-Nyquist wavefront control,\u201d is a way to enable deformable mirrors to suppress starlight beyond their normal limits by using a special \"mild grating,\u201d shown as a grid of blue dots in the image below. Normally, a DM can only suppress starlight in a small region around a star, like a single tent pole (the star) supporting a small tent (DM control region). This poses a problem when imaging binary stars, because a typical DM can only suppress starlight from both stars if those stars\u2019 two regions overlap. However, binary stars tend to be far apart, so there is no overlap, like two small tents that are far away from each other. The mild grating solves this problem by creating a grid of faint copies of the second star (so-called \u201cdiffraction orders\u201d), extending the reach of the DM to a much larger region around each star, similar to how a grid of tent poles can support a larger tent than a single pole. Using these two techniques, a coronagraph can overcome cross-contamination and increase the starlight contrast to image exoplanets in binary star systems.\n\nLeft: Microscope image of an optical mask that enables suppression of stars in multi-star systems to reveal planets in such systems. Middle and right: the enabling element is a grid of dots (mild grating), shown in this design image at different zoom levels.\n\nBecause deformable mirrors will be present in essentially all future coronagraphic mission concepts, MSWC is compatible with most of them, without requiring a major instrument redesign. This compatibility enabled MSWC to be accepted as a contributed mode on the Roman Space Telescope\u2019s Coronagraph Instrument, with only slight modifications of the single-star instrument masks. Testing MSWC on the sky with Roman\u2019s coronagraph will demonstrate this important technology to enable imaging of exoplanets in binary star systems, and has the potential to detect planets around binaries like Alpha Centauri.\n\nThe MSWC team has been steadily maturing the technology through simulations as well as demonstrations at the Ames Coronagraph Experiment Laboratory and on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument on the Subaru Telescope\u2014a ground-based telescope operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Also, over the past few years, the team extended MSWC testing to the High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a state-of-the-art facility for high-contrast demonstrations in vacuum.\n\nTeam members working at the High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) facility at NASA\u2019s JPL. Pictured left to right: Eduardo Bendek, Ruslan Belikov, Dan Sirbu, and David Marx. The goal of these tests is to perform a vacuum demonstration of the MSWC technology by suppressing the glare of more than one star to reveal dim planets that are otherwise hidden.\n\nMSWC has made significant strides, demonstrating the basic feasibility of suppressing starlight from more than one star, as well as doing so for stars that are separated beyond the conventional limits of deformable mirrors. Now, the team is hard at work to increase the performance, ultimately to levels required for detecting Earthlike planets.\n\n\u201cJust imagine -- when you go outside and look at a star in the night sky, you might be looking at a planet just like the Earth, hidden in the star\u2019s glare,\u201d said Ruslan Belikov, the project lead for MSWC. \u201cAlso, chances are that the star you\u2019re looking it is a multi-star system. I just can\u2019t wait until we lift veils of starlight to unlock the secrets that lie on the planets within.\u201d\n\nAcknowledgment: This work was supported by NASA Internal Scientist Funding Model (ISFM) program and led by the NASA Ames Research Center.

            "summary": "Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) is an innovative technology by NASA that enables imaging and searching for signs of life on Earth-like planets orbiting stars in multi-star systems. It relies on two different sets of shapes (spatial frequency modes) to control deformable mirrors and a special \"mild grating\u201d grid, in order to suppress light from both stars independently. MSWC has been demonstrated at the Ames Coronagraph Experiment Laboratory and the Subaru Telescope, as well as tested with the High Contrast Imaging Testbed at JPL. If successful, MSWC could open up a new era of exoplanet exploration within binary star systems such as Alpha Centauri."

            "text": "HAS will be instrumental for the use of applications requiring precise localisation, such as deployment of autonomus driving vehicles, safety road technology and drones.\n\nGalileo\u2019s positioning service, the High Accuracy Service (HAS) is now freely available to users around the globe. It targets a positioning accuracy better than 20 cm in the horizontal domain and 40 cm in the vertical domain, in nominal conditions of use.\n\nThe new service will be instrumental for the use of applications requiring precise localisation, such as deployment of autonomous driving vehicles, safety road technology and drones. Other applications concern agriculture, rail, aviation, maritime, space, consumer solutions and geomatics.\n\nWorking until now in testing mode, HAS ensures high accuracy corrections via two dissemination channels: E6-B Signal in Space (SiS) and a terrestrial link, which provides an alternate source to the SiS through internet.\n\nJRC contribution\n\nOver the years, the JRC has contributed to the definition, testing and validation of Galileo\u2019s High Accuracy Service (HAS), supporting the European Commission\u2018s Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space (DEFIS) and the EU agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).\n\nThe work included studies on the processing of the Galileo E6-B signal, carrying the HAS data, within Galileo receivers, technical support to the definition of Galileo Programme reference documents, as well as testing and validation activities of the HAS service. The JRC assessed the ultimate performance of HAS under different conditions.\n\nExperimental activities were performed within the JRC Testing and Demonstration Hub for EU GNSS, the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMSL) as well as the JRC Living Labs, developing specific routines and laboratory setups and exploiting the HAS User Terminal, procured by EUSPA and hosted in the JRC laboratories.\n\nBackground\n\nGalileo is a component of the EU Space Programme, which is designed to bolster the EU Space policy in the fields of Earth Observation, Satellite Navigation, Connectivity, Space Research and Innovation. The programme supports investments in critical infrastructure and disruptive technologies.\n\nRelated links\n\nEUSPA Press release\n\nGalileo High Accuracy Service (HAS)",
