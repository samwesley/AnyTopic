This move comes few days after the Supreme Court upheld the Competition Commision Of India (CCI)\u2019s order against Google.\n\nBefore finalising the new licence agreement with mobile device OEMs, Google will place it before the CCI for its endorsement, Business Standard reported citing sources.\n\n\u201cWe cannot make any changes in the licensing agreement with Google or we will risk cancellation. Under this agreement, the licensing of Google Play Store requires us to pre-install 5-7 Google apps, which include Google search, Gmail, Youtube, Google Maps, and Duo, amongst others,\u201d an executive of a mobile device company said as quoted in the report.\n\nThe executive also pointed out that the placement of these apps are also decided under the licence. The apex court order coupled with the CCI\u2019s directions, will change such rules, he added.\n\nAs per the CCI order, mobile device makers will not be compelled to pre-install a bouquet of Play Store applications and follow the placement rules. Moreover, customers will also get the choice to uninstall Google apps.\n\nWhile Google has always argued that such pre-installation keeps android free of charge, many developers, manufacturers in India have opposed such norms saying it imposes restrictions and curbs competition in the market.\n\nThe CCI in its order has directed Google that the licencing of its Play Store \u201cshall not be linked with the requirement of pre-installing\u201d Google search services, the Chrome browser, YouTube or any other Google applications.\n\nIt also asked the US-based tech major to allow the uninstalling of its apps by Android phone users in India.\n\nHowever, allowing or sideloading third party apps on the Play Store platform may pose several challenges including security issues, according to mobile device makers.\n\n\u201cWhile Google wants the responsibility to be pushed on us, we have nothing to do with it, as our relationship with a consumer ends with the selling of the phone, after which, it is limited to fulfilling warranty requirements. Why should we invest in the security and upgrades of apps?,\u201d a senior executive of a mobile device brand said as quoted in the report.\n\nGoogle has been the subject of a slew of antitrust investigations by the competition watchdog. Last year, the CCI said that the tech major was abusing its market dominance in the Android devices market after three years of probe.\n\nWhile a fine of INR 1,337.7 Cr was imposed on Google in the Android devices case, an additional INR 936 Cr penalty was imposed on Google for its lop-sided Play Store policies.\n\nAndroid continues to lead the operating system market in India, accounting for 90-95% of the Indian market.",

            "text": "Microsoft will increase its investment in OpenAI as the tech battle heats up\n\nBy StartupStory | January 24, 2023\n\nMicrosoft stated on Monday that it would boost its investment in OpenAI, basing its future on the company and its technology that gave rise to the ChatGPT chatbot craze and paved the door for greater Google-Google competition.\n\nIn a blog post, Microsoft said, \u201cToday, we are announcing the third phase of our long-term partnership with OpenAI through a multiyear, multibillion dollar investment to accelerate AI breakthroughs to ensure these benefits are broadly shared with the world.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft is capitalizing on a bet it made on OpenAI almost four years ago and recently hailed an AI revolution. Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman co-founded the firm in 2019, and it invested $1 billion in it. Since then, among other ways of support, it has developed a supercomputer to power OpenAI\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cWe formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,\u201d said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. \u201cIn this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe past three years of our partnership have been great,\u201d said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. \u201cMicrosoft shares our values and we are excited to continue our independent research and work toward creating advanced AI that benefits everyone.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft is investing even more resources to maintain the two businesses at the forefront by utilizing so-called generative AI, a technology that can learn from huge data how to create practically any form of content just from a text input. In Silicon Valley last year, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which produces prose or poetry on demand, stood out as a noteworthy example.\n\nMicrosoft announced last week that it planned to include such AI into all of its products, as OpenAI continues its mission to develop artificial intelligence that is comparable to human intelligence. Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine, which is being mentioned as a potential Google rival for the first time in years, already incorporates OpenAI technology.\n\nThe much anticipated investment shows how Google, the pioneer of significant AI research, is locked in battle with Microsoft. Google is already planning its own unveiling for this spring.\n\nFollow Startup Story",

It stores renewable energy at scale to enable a secure, flexible and affordable green energy system. The startup helps to accelerate the transition to net zero and enhance the security and flexibility of energy systems.\n\n\u2018The EU\u2019s objective is to reach over 80% renewable energy by 2050. Corre Energy is accelerating this energy transition through underground energy storage by developing, building and operating storage systems in salt caverns, specifically hydrogen-fuelled Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), green hydrogen production, and storage in salt caverns.\u2019\n\nIs there a market for LDES?\n\n\n\nTo put it simply, yes! More and more people are becoming conscious of their own environmental impact and looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint. This is where renewable energy sources come into play. While they offer low- or zero-carbon emissions, they need an adequate storage solution.\n\nRecently, Matthew Lynn of The Telegraph reported on the plans to keep the UK\u2019s last remaining coal power plant open until at least 2023. In the article, Lynn also discusses renewables and the need for proper storage of this type of energy: \u2018renewables might be great in the long term, but until we have lots of excess capacity or new forms of storage, they can\u2019t be relied upon.\u2019\n\nCorre Energy has developed LDES projects and products to store energy at scale to enable a secure, flexible and affordable green energy system.\n\n\u2018The European and global energy markets are seeing substantial growth of renewables; increased volatility in wholesale prices, including negative prices becoming more common place; and the growing electrification of EVs and heating as governments seek to decarbonise.\u2019\n\nWant to be featured as TechRound\u2019s Startup of the Week? Find out more about this weekly feature, and how to get involved, here.\n\nWhat projects does Corre Energy have?\n\n\n\nCorre Energy currently has two projects: one in the Netherlands and one in Denmark. These projects both provide a solution for storing renewable energy.\n\nZW1 \u2013 This is a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) project in the Netherlands. CAES is a highly flexible large-scale energy storage technology that uses underground storage caverns to store energy. These storage caverns \u2013 sometimes known as salt caverns \u2013 are created in geological salt deposits by a salt extraction process.\n\n\u2013 This is a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) project in the Netherlands.

DK1 \u2013 This is a hydrogen storage project located in Denmark. The Green Hydrogen Hub Denmark aims to be the world\u2019s first project to combine large-scale green hydrogen production with two large-scale energy storage solutions. These storage solutions are underground hydrogen storage and CAES \u2013 as used in the Netherlands with the ZW1 project.\n\nWould you like SEO or PR for your business?\n\nContact us here for more information >>",

The agency will review the application on Wednesday.\n\nSign up for the Buffalo Next free newsletter The News' Buffalo Next team covers the changing Buffalo Niagara economy. Get the news in your inbox 5 days a week.\n\nThe company founded by Rebecca Brady is relocating its production, warehouse and office operations from 6,000 square feet of space at 257 Cayuga St. in Cheektowaga to 35,000 square feet in the former Heritage Centers building at 101 Oak St., across the street from the new Braymiller Market at 201 Ellicott St.\n\nThat will enable the startup firm to automate some of its labor-intensive work and increase its cracker production six-fold, from 1 million boxes annually to 6 million, to meet surging demand. It will also have more room for storage and administration. The new location also is more convenient for most of its 29 employees, who largely live in Buffalo, and for potential new workers coming from East Buffalo. The company pans to hire at least seven full-time employees.\n\nTop Seedz will invest its $1 million prize from 43North, while also getting a $750,000 working capital loan from M&T Bank Corp. However, M&T can't provide the rest because of internal limits on credit exposure for a project of this type, so Top Seedz is asking the RDC to provide gap financing in the form of an 8-year term loan for $750,000, at 4% interest.\n\nEmpire State Development Corp. is also providing $315,000 in Excelsior Jobs refundable tax credits for the project.\n\nSeparately, Linita \u2013 located at 951 Hamburg Turnpike in Lackawanna, at the former Bethlehem Steel campus \u2013 is also seeking a $750,000 working capital loan at 4%.\n\nFederal infrastructure spending in recent years and a new focus on hydropower has driven a doubling of the overall industry from $1 billion to $2 billion, and Linita's own business has grown from $34 million in bids annually until fiscal 2021 to $73 million last year and $150 million in its current fiscal year. It has a backlog of projects, including two of the biggest U.S. hydropower ventures in the past 50 years, each ranging from $20 million to $30 million.\n\nSo it wants to hire 15 employees over the next two years, on top of its current workforce of 40.\n\nThe company is now seeking an eight-year term loan, and will invest another $200,000 of its own capital into the $950,000 project.\n\nFounded in 1973 as a small fabrication shop in Guelph, Ont., the company initially served the hydraulic press industry but expanded in the early 1990s into the the hydro-electric power and flood protection market for producing hoists and water-control gates for dams.\n\nIts current owners, Carlos and Eva Vera, acquired the company in 2003 and expanded into the United States in 2010 with an 80,000-square-foot facility.",

It didn\u2019t disclose the dollar amount for its latest investment.\n\nWATCH: Advances in artificial intelligence raise new ethics concerns\n\nThe partnership positions Microsoft to sharpen its competition with Google in commercializing new AI breakthroughs that could transform numerous professions, as well as the internet search business.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s free writing tool ChatGPT launched on Nov. 30 and has brought public attention to the possibilities of new advances in AI.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a new generation of machine-learning systems that can converse, generate readable text on demand and produce novel images and video based on what they\u2019ve learned from a vast database of digital books, online writings and other media.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s partnership enables it to capitalize on OpenAI\u2019s technology. Microsoft\u2019s supercomputers are helping to power the startup\u2019s energy-hungry AI systems, while the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant will be able to further integrate OpenAI technology into Microsoft products.\n\n\u201cIn this next phase of our partnership,\u201d said a statement from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, customers who use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing platform will have access to new AI tools to build and run their applications.\n\nREAD MORE: How AI turns text into images\n\nOpenAI started out as a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company when it launched in December 2015. With Tesla CEO Elon Musk as its co-chair and among its early investors, the organization\u2019s stated aims were to \u201cadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\u201d\n\nThat changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT model for generating human-like paragraphs of readable text. Musk also left its board in 2018.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s other products include the image-generator DALL-E, first released in 2021, the computer programming assistant Codex and the speech recognition tool Whisper.\n\nMicrosoft said Monday its strengthened partnership can help \u201cto accelerate AI breakthroughs to ensure these benefits are broadly shared with the world.\u201d\n\nThe investment announcement came a day before Microsoft was scheduled to report its earnings from the October-December financial quarter and after disclosing last week its plans to lay off 10,000 employees, close to 5% of its global workforce.",

            "text": "Scaling back facilities, canceling travel and keeping staff lean helps startups stretch every dollar raised\n\nIf it was easier to raise money, Plasmos might have a dedicated facility for testing rocket engines. Instead, the propulsion startup rented a speedboat restoration shop east of Los Angeles.\n\nThere, \u201cwe managed to test something, and it was successful,\u201d said Plasmos CEO Ali Baghchehsara. \u201cWe managed to create plasma in the engine and got high ionization using air.\u201d\n\nAfter years of sky-high valuations and investor competition for shares of promising space startups, high interest rates and the threat of recession have made investors cautious. In response to a lack of new funding sources, space startups are cutting back on hiring, reducing travel and giving up leased office space.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship is always a little bit of survival of the fittest,\u201d said Jason Chen, founder and CEO of VentureScope, a McLean, Virginia, consulting and venture investment firm that works with entrepreneurs. \u201cThis economy definitely tightens the belt a little bit, making teams operate more lean.\u201d\n\nTIME TO DELIVER\n\nUkrainian startup Promin Aerospace trimmed its staff and doubled down on engineering in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe currently have 13 full-time employees. Ten of those are on the engineering team in Dnipro, and three are on the administrative team,\u201d said Promin CEO Misha Rudominski. \u201cWe had 16 employees before the war. We had an office manager and a communications person. We were building the team for future growth.\u201d\n\nInstead of preparing for expansion, a popular approach in 2020 and 2021, startups now focus on extending their burn rate, meaning slowing down the pace of spending.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, are encouraging founders to \u201czero in and focus on their core competencies, whatever is their unique value proposition,\u201d said Chen, a founder of four startups.\n\nFor Lunargistics, a Woodland, Texas startup that offers mission guidance, launch integration and other space services, the economic downturn has meant fewer trips to conferences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s successful and enlightening to meet everyone in an industry in which I and @lunargistics are newcomers, but now\u2019s the time to deliver,\u201d Logan Ryan Golema, Lunargistics founder, chairman and CEO, tweeted in November.\n\nGOVERNMENT LIFELINE\n\nFor some early-stage companies, government contracts or financing programs serve as lifelines.\n\nMatt Kozlov, manager director of the TechStars Los Angeles accelerator, said the most important advice he\u2019s giving startups right now is \u201cto relentlessly track, apply for, and win government contracts and grants whenever possible.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department, Energy Department, National Science Foundation, NASA and other government agencies are \u201ca great source of capital, non-dilutive funding opportunities\u201d plus \u201cphenomenal early validations of both a company\u2019s technical viability and the potential interest\u201d of government customers, Kozlov said by email.\n\nAfter winning a government contract, a founder said, \u201cIt means we don\u2019t have to lay people off, and we can keep building the new things that we want to build.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs, who enthusiastically share news of technological achievements and fundraising success, are far less eager to discuss financial woes and layoffs. When promised they would not be quoted by name, though, they speak freely about the stark differences between 2021, a banner year for space investment, and 2022.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the funding environment is tight right now,\u201d said a startup founder. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing that across the industry.\u201d\n\nAnother founder said, \u201cEntrepreneurs who raised money just three or four months before us, raised crazy amounts of money on crazy valuations right off the bat.\u201d\n\nCAPITAL EXPENSE CUTBACKS\n\nThe reduction in angel, corporate and venture capital dollars flowing into the space sector is making perseverance particularly difficult for startups needing significant funding before generating revenue.\n\nSpaceLink was forced to wind down operations after its parent company, Australia\u2019s Electro Optic Systems Holdings Ltd., came up empty in its search for outside investors willing to provide $70 million in the near term and $250 million overall for SpaceLink\u2019s planned data-relay constellation in medium-Earth orbit.\n\nWhile medium-Earth orbit is a great vantage point for communicating with satellites in low-Earth orbit, \u201cgetting equipment, satellites and launch capability to MEO does lead to some capital-intensive pre-revenue spending,\u201d said SpaceLink CEO Dave Bettinger.\n\nOther entrepreneurial companies have continued to operate while scaling back capital-intensive projects.\n\nIn December, British cybersecurity software developer Arqit scrapped plans for a space-based quantum encryption network, citing the cost and risk compared with establishing a terrestrial network.\n\nIn October, small satellite specialist Terran Orbital canceled plans for its own synthetic aperture radar constellation, opting instead to build SAR satellites and sell them directly to commercial and government customers.\n\nWORKAROUNDS\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict how long the current investment climate will last.\n\nSpace Capital noted nearly $300 billion of dry powder, investment dollars remaining on the sidelines, in its third quarter report released in October.\n\n\u201cWe are still waiting for the floodgates to open,\u201d Space Capital said, as VCs shift from pure momentum investing to a greater focus on diligence and price control.\n\nUntil the floodgates open, founders of early-stage startups like Los Angeles-based Plasmos are finding inexpensive workarounds.\n\n\u201cGiven the constraints of fundraising in the market, we have done things scrappy and low cost,\u201d Baghchehsara said.\n\nPlasmos has few employees, and the startup\u2019s technology, which combines elements of chemical and electric propulsion, doesn\u2019t fit common propulsion testing facilities.\n\nTo make do, Baghchehsara found a welder to build a rocket test stand by advertising on Craigslist. One of the people who responded introduced Baghchehsara to GT Performance Engineering, a marine services specialist in Upland, California.\n\nOne weekend, \u201cI started carefully using their expensive machines,\u201d Baghchehsara said. \u201cThat same weekend, we fired the engine because these people were extremely knowledgeable in machining.\u201d\n\nEven though GT Performance Engineering employees had never worked on rocket engines, they were eager to help Plasmos conduct tests.\n\n\u201cThey call me the boom guy,\u201d Baghchehsara said. \u201cEveryone comes around and helps me out.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in the January 2023 issue of SpaceNews magazine",

            "text": "Veteran tech giant PayPal is facing an antitrust investigation in Germany \u2014 where the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) has announced it\u2019s looking into its rules on surcharges.\n\nThe regulator is concerned that restrictions PayPal imposes on merchants could be harming competitors and inflating costs for consumers by restricting price competition.\n\nClauses in PayPal\u2019s terms the FCO said it\u2019s examining include traders not being allowed to offer their goods and services at lower prices if customers choose a cheaper payment method than PayPal; and sellers not being allowed to express any preference for payment methods other than PayPal, or to make an alternative payment tech more convenient for customers.\n\n\u201cThe fees to be paid by sellers for using a payment service vary considerably depending on the payment method. Retailers usually pass these fees on to the product prices, so that consumers ultimately bear the costs of the payment services, even if these \u2013 unlike shipping costs, for example \u2013 are usually not reported separately to consumers,\u201d the FCO explained in a press release [the original is in German; this is a machine translation of that text].\n\n\u201cAccording to market studies, PayPal is not only the leading provider of online payments in Germany but also one of the most expensive online payment services. According to PayPal\u2019s price list, PayPal\u2019s standard fee in Germany is currently 2.49 \u2013 2.99 percent of the payment amount plus 34-39 cents per payment,\u201d it added.\n\nCommenting in a statement Andreas Mundt, president of the FCO, said: \u201cThese clauses could restrict competition and constitute a violation of the prohibition on abuse. We will now examine what market power PayPal has and to what extent online retailers are dependent on offering PayPal as a payment method. If merchants are prevented from taking into account the different costs of the various payment methods with corresponding surcharges or discounts, other and new payment methods can hold their own less well in the price and quality competition or not even come onto the market. Payment services with market power could thus gain further leeway for their own pricing. The victims would then be the consumers in particular, who ultimately pay these higher costs indirectly through the product prices.\u201d\n\nPayPal was contacted for a response.\n\nWhile German antitrust activity has been garnering wider attention in recent years, after the country updated its competition rules at the startup of 2021 \u2014 arming the FCO with greater powers to proactively address the market power of digital giants \u2014 the proceeding against PayPal is not one of those special abuse control cases.\n\nA spokesperson for the FCO confirmed in this case it\u2019s applying \u2018classic\u2019 competition rules \u2014 which means the regulator will first need to determine whether has a dominant position for payments before it can assess whether or not there has been any breach. So the proceeding may take some time to run its course.\n\nIn a separate antitrust action in Europe last year \u2014 also concerning digital payments \u2014 the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets forced iOS maker Apple to allow dating apps operating in the market to use non-Apple-based payment technology to process in-app sales. Apple initially sought to challenge the order but after a string of penalty payments and several months of back and forth, it came with a proposal that was accepted by the watchdog last summer.\n\nIn recent years, the European Union has also been eyeing online payment tech \u2014 taking action last year over restrictions Apple applies to Apple Pay.\n\nSuch interventions prefigure bigger and potentially more impactful changes coming for tech giants in the European Union this year as a major competition reform, called the Digital Markets Act, comes into application across the bloc. This \u201cex ante\u201d regime will flip the classical antitrust protocol \u2014 whereby market power must be assessed and investigation precedes remedy \u2014 by applying, up front, a set of fixed rules on platforms designated as competitively significant \u201cgatekeepers\u201d. So as to become more responsive and proactively level the playing field between giants and the smaller competitors that rely on them to reach consumers.",

            "text": "MapmyIndia CEO Rohan Verma is wary of calling the SC ruling a win s because of the power that Google wields in the tech industry With its market power, Google has made the OEM subservient to itself and blocked out competition Verma believes that Google can learn a thing or two from Microsoft which changed its anti-competitive behaviour in the early 2000s\n\nWhile Google\u2019s appeal seeking interim relief against the competition watchdog\u2019s (CCI) ruling was turned down by the Supreme Court last week, MapmyIndia\u2019s CEO Rohan Verma fears that the battle of the Indian app ecosystem against the tech behemoth is far from being won. In particular, he is scathing on how the tech giant has forced Google Maps on to Android phones at the expense of the competition such as MapmyIndia.\n\nIn October last year, tech giant Google was hit with an INR 2,274 penalty by the CCI for alleged anti-competitive practices. The penalty came with directions for Google to make significant changes to how Android is distributed to customers (OEMs) as well as Google\u2019s billing and payment policies for app purchases through the Google Play Store.\n\nAt the time, we wrote that these directives will change the course of India\u2019s app ecosystem, since it would offer app developers and tech startups more distribution points and potentially better revenue.\n\nAs expected, Google appealed in the Supreme Court, asking for interim relief. However, the appeal has been turned down by the apex court.\n\nIf there\u2019s a reason that MapmyIndia CEO Verma is wary of calling this a win yet, it\u2019s because of the power that Google wields in the tech industry.\n\n\u201cJust look at what they did in the EU. They have been fined billions of dollars, but things seem to be just as they were before the fines,\u201d Verma told Inc42 days after the SC ruling.\n\nVerma\u2019s belief that Google did not fix its algorithms and abuse of dominant position is backed by organisations such as Fairsearch, which had written to the EU commissioner for competition in 2018, after Google was fined $2.4 Bn in 2017.\n\nOf course, Verma\u2019s contention is primarily against Google Maps, which is the product that MapmyIndia primarily competes with. But he\u2019s also quite keen on loosening the stronghold that Google Search has.\n\n\u201cWe have been fighting this battle for 15 years. Google came to India with Maps in 2007, and it was an inferior product. They gradually improved it and then forced it on OEMs. But it\u2019s still not suitable for the Indian market as much as MapmyIndia.\u201d\n\nGoogle Maps Vs MapmyIndia\n\nGoogle Maps entered the Indian market in 2007, while MapmyIndia has been around since 1997, a whole decade before the tech giant. But Verma believes that even now features such as speed limit indicators, pothole indicators, 3D junction view (for exits and flyovers) set MapmyIndia apart from Google Maps.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a lot of accidents can be prevented by these features. For an average person, if you see a speed limit, they will follow it, right? Behaviorally, this is important information. Most people will not overspeed when they have the information.\u201d\n\nEven as it launched in the market a decade after MapmyIndia, Google had the strength of position to dictate terms to Android device makers, car makers, TV makers and more. The primary issue is that Google mandated that device makers pre-install Google-made apps, with no possibility of replacements.\n\nVerma said that while at one point, MapmyIndia came pre-installed on Samsung, Blackberry, and Motorola devices, Google\u2019s mandate to some of these players pushed MapmyIndia out. It also made conversations with these OEMs impossible for players like MapmyIndia.\n\n\u201cThe key point is when you hold so much market power, and you have made the OEM subservient to you, do you think the OEM will do anything against you? Google clearly made them sign a deal saying they will not do anything that will fragment Android,\u201d the CEO told Inc42.\n\nThe point is that Google\u2019s agreements with the OEM \u2014 the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA), the Anti-Fragmentation Agreement (AFA)/Android Compatibility Commitment (ACC), the Revenue Sharing Agreement (RSA) and Mobile Service Distribution/Placement Bonus Agreement \u2014 forced companies to occlude Google\u2019s competition from being pre-installed.\n\n\u2018Google Leaves Little Space For Competitors\u2019\n\nThe CCI argued users do not download competitor apps to Google\u2019s suite of applications due to a status-quo bias. Google left little space for competitors to enter the market, the antitrust watchdog said.\n\n\u201cSo what were the options we had? Raise a billion dollars, and then pay that to Google to get our app in front of Google Maps? The cost is so high that it would make no business sense for us or anyone. And that\u2019s what anti-competition law talks about. They have raised the bar so high for a competitor,\u201d MapmyIndia\u2019s Verma added.\n\nFor Verma, though, the fight is not just against Google Maps, but other products by the tech giant that also add to the anti-competitive practices. Take Google Search for instance. \u201cAbout 25% of all searches are related to location and maps. And Google has nearly 100% market share in the search business. There\u2019s no way to get MapmyIndia in the Maps section of search, because Google has completely controlled the experience.\u201d\n\nHe adds that as a company, Google is of course free to make changes in its products, but the fact is that it is using its dominant position in search to also dictate how websites, publishers, content creators, bloggers and others publish content.\n\nIn fact, when it suited Google, it has backed anti-competition rulings such as the one against Microsoft in the EU in 2010 when it fought to add a feature in Windows to allow users to choose their browser of choice. This helped Google Chrome reach the highest market share in Europe.\n\nVerma believes that Microsoft changed its behaviour and is as successful if not more than what it was in the 90s and 2000s.",

By pre-installing its own apps such as Maps and using its search engine dominance, competition from MapmyIndia and other startups has been blocked out and users have difficulty accessing alternative services. Despite this, Verma believes that if Microsoft was able to change their anti-competitive practices in 2000s then so can Google."

            "text": "Sean Penn, Jesse Eisenberg, Canadian actor-director Matt Johnson, Korean auteur Hong Sangsoo, and Korean-Canadian director Celine Song are headed to the upcoming Berlin Film Festival.\n\nBerlinale artistic director Carlo Chatrian and executive director Mari\u00ebtte Rissenbeck on Monday unveiled the main Competition and Encounters selections for the fest\u2019s 73rd edition, which will feature a rich mix of known names and newcomers, as well as a strong political emphasis.\n\nPenn will be in Berlin with \u201cSuperpower,\u201d the doc he co-directed with Aaron Kaufman that depicts the struggle between Volodymyr Zelensky, the actor and comedian who became president of Ukraine, and Russian president Vladimir Putin, as Russia deploys a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cPenn was in Kiev shooting a film with Zelensky when the war in Ukraine burst,\u201d Chatrian said at a press conference in Berlin. \u201cReality made the film change into something less comfortable and more meaningful,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are very grateful to Sean Penn and the entire team to have picked the Berlinale to show this film.\u201d The programmer noted that the doc details the roles of art and artists in war.\n\nRissenbeck and Chatrian revealed that the colors of this year\u2019s Berlinale would be blue and yellow \u2014 the colors of the Ukrainian flag. Elaborating on the decision to select \u201cSuperpower,\u201d Chatrian said: \u201cI guess part of the decision is precisely that the Berlin Film Festival will take place exactly one year after the burst of war and maybe showing this film in Berlin has a more relevant meaning that in any other place, because we are close to Ukraine, because Ukrainian people live in Berlin and also because of the political value of this film. But it\u2019s not the only one dealing with Ukraine. For me \u2018Superpower\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019m aware that it will drag a lot of attention \u2014 is a great door to let you enter to the very complex, rich description of what happened and is still happening in Ukraine right now.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, South African director John Trengove will be making his Berlinale competition debut with \u201cManodrome,\u201d starring Jesse Eisenberg and Adrien Brody. Trengove opened Panorama in 2018 with \u201cThe Wound.\u201d He is now back with his first U.S. movie. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg as a young man in upstate New York \u201cwho is about to become a father and feels a sense of loss,\u201d said Chatrian, who noted that the pic is about \u201cwhat masculinity is today in Western society.\u201d Odessa Young plays the protagonist\u2019s partner. Brody stars as a cult leader.\n\nMatt Johnson biopic \u201cBlackBerry,\u201d which depicts the rise and fall of the Canadian smartphone company and stars Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerton and Cary Elwes, is among other standouts ensconced in a Berlinale competition slot.\n\nProlific South Korean director Hong Sangsoo, a Berlin regular, is back with his latest work \u201cIn Water,\u201d which is screening in the more cutting-edge, competitive Encounters section.\n\nCeline Song\u2019s \u201cPast Lives,\u201d which premiered to positive reviews at Sundance, will be launching internationally from the Berlinale competition.\n\nMeanwhile, titles by newcomers in competition comprise \u201cDisco Boy,\u201d a first feature by France-based Italian director Giacomo Abbruzzese, about a refugee who arrives in Paris to join the Foreign Legion as a means to obtain a promised passport.\n\nAll told, there are 18 films competing for the Golden Bear, six of which are directed by women. Eleven of the directors have been at the Berlinale before, eight of which are in competition. Three of the competition entries are by first-time directors.\n\nFifteen of the 18 titles are world premieres. The fest\u2019s international premieres comprise Japanese anime director Makoto Shinkai\u2019s \u201cSuzume,\u201d a crowdpleaser that has been a massive hit at the Japanese box office.\n\nAs previously announced, Rebecca Miller\u2019s romantic comedy \u201cShe Came To Me,\u201d starring Peter Dinklage, Marisa Tomei, Joanna Kulig, Brian d\u2019Arcy James and Anne Hathaway, has been set as the festival opener.\n\nKristen Stewart will preside over the jury and Steven Spielberg will receive an honorary Golden Bear for lifetime achievement.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION LINEUP\n\n\u201c20,000 Species of Bees\u201d by Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren (Spain)\n\n\u201cThe Shadowless Tower\u201d by Zhang Lu (China)\n\n\u201cTill the End of the Night\u201d by Christoph Hochhausler (Germany)\n\n\u201cBlackBerry\u201d by Matt Johnson (Canada)\n\n\u201cDisco Boy\u201d by Giacomo Abbruzzese (France/Italy/Poland/Belgium)\n\n\u201cThe Plough\u201d by Philippe Garrel (France/Switzerland)\n\n\u201cIngeborg Bachmann \u2013 Journey into the Desert\u201d by Margarethe von Trotta (Germany/Switzerland/Austria/Luxembourg)\n\n\u201cSomeday We\u2019ll Tell Each Other Everything\u201d by Emily Atef (Germany)\n\n\u201cLimbo\u201d by Ivan Sen (Australia)\n\n\u201cBad Living\u201d by Joao Canijo (Portugal/France)\n\n\u201cManodrome\u201d by John Trengove (U.K./U.S.)\n\n\u201cMusic\u201d by Angela Schanelec (Germany/France/Serbia)\n\n\u201cPast Lives\u201d by Celine Song (U.S.)\n\n\u201cAfire\u201d by Christian Petzold (Germany)\n\n\u201cOn the Adamant\u201d by Nicolas Philibert (France/Japan)\n\n\u201cThe Survival of Kindness\u201d by Rolf de Heer (Australia)\n\n\u201cSuzume\u201d by Makoto Shinkai (Japan)\n\n\u201cTotem\u201d by Lila Avil\u00e9s (Mexico/Denmark/France)\n\nBERLINALE SPECIAL GALA\n\n\u201cSuperpower\u201d by Sean Penn, Aaron Kaufman (U.S.)\n\nENCOUNTERS FILMS\n\n\u201cThe Klezmer Project\u201d by Leandro Koch, Paloma Schahmann (Argentina/Austria)\n\n\u201cThe Adults\u201d by Dustin Guy Defa (U.S.)\n\n\u201cThe Echo\u201d by Tatiana Huezo (Mexico/Germany)\n\n\u201cHere\u201d by Bas Devos (Belgium)\n\n\u201cIn the Blind Spot\u201d by Ayse Polat (Germany)\n\n\u201cThe Cage is Looking for a Bird\u201d by Malika Musaeva (France/Russia)\n\n\u201cMy Worst Enemy\u201d by Mehran Tamadon (France/Switzerland)\n\n\u201cWhite Plastic Sky\u201d by Tibor Banoczki, Sarolta Szabo (Hungary/Slovakia)\n\n\u201cIn Water\u201d by Hong Sangsoo (South Korea)\n\n\u201cFamily Time\u201d by Tia Kuovo (Finland/Sweden)\n\n\u201cThe Walls of Bergamo\u201d by Stefano Savona (Italy)\n\n\u201cOrlando, My Political Biography\u201d by Paul B.

            "text": "Microsoft today is announcing the third phase of our long-term partnership with OpenAI through a multiyear, multibi\u2026 https://t.co/ACPSPPUZLU \u2014 Microsoft Stories and News (@MSFTnews) 1674482669000\n\nMicrosoft said Monday that it is making a \u201cmultiyear, multibillion-dollar\u201d investment in OpenAI , the San Francisco artificial intelligence lab behind experimental online chatbot ChatGPT The companies did not disclose the specific financial terms of the deal, but a person familiar with the matter said Microsoft will invest $10 billion in OpenAI.Microsoft had already invested more than $3 billion in OpenAI, and the new deal is a clear indication of the importance of OpenAI\u2019s technology to the future of Microsoft and its competition with other big tech companies like Google , Meta and Apple.With Microsoft\u2019s deep pockets and OpenAI\u2019s cutting-edge artificial intelligence, the companies hope to remain at the forefront of generative artificial intelligence \u2014 technologies that can generate text, images and other media in response to short prompts. After its surprise release at the end of November, ChatGPT \u2014 a chatbot that answers questions in clear, well-punctuated prose \u2014 became the symbol of a new and more powerful wave of AI.The fruit of more than a decade of research inside companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta, these technologies are poised to remake everything from online search engines like Google Search and Microsoft Bing to photo and graphics editors like Photoshop.The deal follows Microsoft\u2019s announcement last week that it had begun laying off employees in part of an effort to cull 10,000 positions. The changes, including severance, ending leases and what it called \u201cchanges to our hardware portfolio,\u201d would cost $1.2 billion, it said.Satya Nadella, the company\u2019s CEO, said last week that the cuts would let the company refocus on priorities such as artificial intelligence, which he called \u201cthe next major wave of computing.\u201dNadella made clear in his company\u2019s announcement Monday that the next phase of the partnership with OpenAI would focus on bringing tools to the market, saying \u201cdevelopers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models and tool chain.\u201dOpenAI was created in 2015 by small group of entrepreneurs and AI researchers, including Sam Altman, head of startup builder Y Combinator; Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla; and Ilya Sutskever, one of the most important researchers of the past decade.They founded the lab as a nonprofit organization. But after Musk left the venture in 2018, Altman remade OpenAI as a for-profit company so that it could raise the money needed for its research.A year later, Microsoft invested $1 billion in the company; over the next few years, it quietly invested another $2 billion. These funds paid for the enormous amounts of computing power needed to build the kind of generative AI technologies OpenAI is known for.OpenAI is also in talks to complete a deal in which it would sell existing shares in a so-called tender offer. This could total $300 million, depending on how many employees agree to sell their stock, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, and would value the company at around $29 billion.In 2020, OpenAI built a milestone AI system called GPT-3 that could generate text on its own, including tweets, blog posts, news articles and even computer code. Last year, it unveiled DALL-E, which lets anyone generate photorealistic images simply by describing what they want to see.Based on the same technology as GPT-3, ChatGPT showed the general public just how powerful this kind of technology could be. More than 1 million people tested the chatbot during its first few days online, using it to answer trivia questions, explain ideas and generate everything from poetry to term papers.Microsoft has already incorporated GPT-3, DALL-E and other OpenAI technologies into its own products. Most notably, GitHub, a popular online service for programmers owned by Microsoft, offers a tool called Copilot that can automatically generate snippets of computer code.Last week, it expanded the availability of several OpenAI services to customers of Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing offering and said ChatGPT would be \u201ccoming soon.\u201dThe company said it planned to report its latest quarterly results Tuesday, and investors expect the difficult economy, including declining personal computer sales and more cautious business spending, to further hit revenues.Microsoft has faced slowing growth since late summer, and Wall Street analysts expect the new financial results to show its slowest growth since 2016. But the business still produces substantial profits and cash. It has continued to return money to investors through quarterly dividends and a $60 billion share buyback program authorized by its board in 2021.Both Microsoft and OpenAI say that their goals are even higher than a better chatbot or programming assistant.OpenAI\u2019s stated mission was to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a machine that can do anything the human brain can do. When OpenAI announced its initial deal with Microsoft in 2019, Nadella described it as the kind of lofty goal that a company like Microsoft should pursue, comparing AGI to the company\u2019s efforts to build a quantum computer, a machine that would be exponentially faster than today\u2019s machines.\u201cWhether it\u2019s our pursuit of quantum computing or it\u2019s a pursuit of AGI, I think you need these high-ambition North Stars,\u201d he said.That is not something that researchers necessarily know how to build. But many believe that systems like ChatGPT are a path to this lofty goal.In the near term, these technologies are a way for Microsoft to expand its business, bolster revenue and compete with the likes of Google and Meta, which are also addressing AI advancements with a sense of urgency.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, recently declared a \u201ccode red,\u201d upending plans and jump-starting AI development. Google intends to unveil more than 20 products and demonstrate a version of its search engine with chatbot features this year, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times and two people with knowledge of the plans who were not authorized to discuss them.But the new AI technologies come with a long list of flaws. They often produce toxic content, including misinformation, hate speech and images that are biased against women and people of color.Microsoft, Google, Meta and other companies have been reluctant to release many of these technologies because they could damage their established brands. Five years ago, Microsoft released a chatbot called Tay that generated racist and xenophobic language and quickly removed it from the internet after complaints from users.",
