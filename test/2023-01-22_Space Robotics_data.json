            "text": "In honor of this year\u2019s Penguin Awareness day, the British Antarctic Survey announced the existence of a previously undiscovered emperor penguin colony in one of the most remote and inaccessible parts of Antarctica. Scientists spotted the colony, the 66th to be found on the continent, by comparing satellite imagery captured by the European Space Agency\u2019s Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and Maxar\u2019s WorldView-3 satellite.\n\nThe photo you see below is the one that led the British Antarctic Survey to the colony. The brown stains that contrast against the stark white ice and snow of the Verleger Point in West Antarctica are the accumulated \u201c guano \u201d droppings seabirds like emperor penguins leave behind when they need to relieve themselves. For the last 15 years, the British Antarctic Survey has been searching for new penguin colonies by using satellite imagery to spot the tell-tale poo stains. Of the 66 colonies humans know about in Antarctica, exactly half have been found using satellites.\n\nMaxar Technologies",

What are the exact targets of robotics research funding programs (R&D) officially driven by governments in Asia, Europe and America today? This has been researched by the International Federation of Robotics and published in the 2023 update paper of \u201cWorld Robotics R&D Programs\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 3rd version of World Robotics R&D Programs covers the latest funding developments including updates in 2022,\u201d says Prof. Dr. Jong-Oh Park, Vice-Chairman IFR Research Committee and member of the Executive Board.\n\nThe overview shows that the most advanced robotics countries in terms of annual installations of industrial robots \u2013 China, Japan, USA, South Korea, Germany \u2013 and the EU drive very different R&D strategies:\n\nRobotics R&D programs \u2013 officially driven by governments\n\nIn China, the \u201c14th Five-Year Plan\u201d for Robot Industry Development, released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in Beijing on 21st December 2021, focuses on promoting innovation. The goal is to make China a global leader for robot technology and industrial advancement. Robotics is included in 8 key industries for the next 5 years. In order to implement national science and technology innovation arrangements, the key special program \u201cIntelligent Robots\u201d was launched under the National Key R&D Plan on 23rd April 2022 with a funding of 43.5 million USD. The recent statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR shows that China reached a robot density of 322 units per 10,000 workers in the manufacturing industry: The country ranks 5th worldwide in 2021 compared to 20th (140 units) in 2018.\n\nIn Japan, the \u201cNew Robot Strategy\u201d aims to make the country the world\u00b4s number one robot innovation hub. More than 930.5 million USD in support has been provided by the Japanese government in 2022. Key sectors are manufacturing (77.8 million USD), nursing and medical (55 million USD), infrastructure (643.2 million USD) and agriculture (66.2 million USD). The action plan for manufacturing and service includes projects such as autonomous driving, advanced air mobility or the development of integrated technologies that will be the core of next-generation artificial intelligence and robots. A budget of 440 million USD was allocated to robotics-related projects in the \u201cMoonshot Research and Development Program\u201d over a period of 5 years from 2020 to 2025. According to the statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR, Japan is the world\u00b4s number one industrial robot manufacturer and delivered 45% of the global supply in 2021.\n\nThe 3rd Basic Plan on Intelligent Robots of South Korea is pushing to develop robotics as a core industry in the fourth industrial revolution. The Korean government allocated 172.2 million USD in funding for the \u201c2022 Implementation Plan for the Intelligent Robot\u201d. From 2022 to 2024 a total of 7.41 million USD is planned in funding for the \u201cFull-Scale Test Platform Project for Special-Purpose Manned or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\u201d. The statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d showed an all-time high of 1,000 industrial robots per 10,000 employees in 2021. This makes Korea the country with the highest robot density worldwide.\n\nHorizon Europe is the European Union\u2019s key research and innovation framework program with a budget of 94.30 billion USD for seven years (2021-2027). Top targets are: strengthening the EU\u2019s scientific and technological bases, boosting Europe\u2019s innovation capacity, competitiveness and jobs as well as delivering on citizens\u2019 priorities and sustaining socio-economic models and values. The European Commission provides total funding of 198.5 million USD for the robotics-related work program 2021-2022.\n\nGermany\u00b4s High-Tech Strategy 2025 (HTS) is the fourth edition of the German R&D and innovation program. The German government will provide around 69 million USD annually until 2026 \u2013 a total budget of 345 million USD for five years. As part of the HTS 2025 mission, the program \u201cShaping technology for the people\u201d was launched. This program aims to use technological change in society as a whole and in the world of work for the benefit of people. Research topics are: digital assistance systems such as data glasses, human-robot-collaboration, exoskeletons to support employees in their physical work, but also solutions for the more flexible organization of work processes or the support of mobile work. According to the report \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR, Germany is the largest robot market in Europe \u2013 the robot density ranks in 4th place worldwide with 397 units per 10,000 employees.\n\nThe National Robotics Initiative (NRI) in the USA was launched for fundamental robotics R&D supported by the US government. The NRI-3.0 program, announced in February 2021, seeks research on integrated robot systems and builds upon the previous NRI programs. The US government supported the NRI-3.0 fund to the sum of 14 million USD in 2021. Collaboration among academics, industry, government, non-profit, and other organizations is encouraged. The \u201cMoon to Mars\u201d project by NASA for example highlights objectives to establish a long-term presence in the vicinity of and on the moon. The projects target research and technology development that will significantly increase the performance of robots to collaboratively support deep space human exploration and science missions. For the Artemis lunar program, the US government is planning to allocate a budget of 35 billion USD from 2020 to 2024. The statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR shows that robot density in the United States rose from 255 units in 2020 to 274 units in 2021. The country ranks 9th in the world. Regarding annual installations of industrial robots, the USA takes 3rd position.\n\nInternational Federation of Robotics (IFR) connects the world of robotics around the globe. We aim at promoting the positive benefits of robots for productivity, competitiveness, economic growth and quality of work and life.",

            "text": "Olivier Toupet started his career working on autonomous helicopters.\n\nThe former supervisor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab now works at AV startup Zoox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Olivier Toupet, 42, a principal software engineer working within the planning and controls team at Zoox, the autonomous-vehicle startup owned by Amazon. Toupet is based in San Diego County, California. He started his career as an aerospace engineer and has an M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT and a M.S. in aeronautical engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO in France. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFrance is where I grew up and went to school for aerospace engineering.\n\nMy original passion is really in aeronautics and airplanes. I got my private pilot license. That school was a top space school in France, and has partnerships with top schools in the US, so I decided to do a double diploma at MIT.\n\nI've always been very interested in the US. I came during high school for a full month to a school in Philadelphia. I was excited to come again, this time for graduate school.\n\nI was lucky enough to find a French professor doing research on aerobatic helicopters.\n\nThat was in the early 2000s. Those were small-scale helicopters that were fully autonomous and flying the sky, doing the craziest aerobatics. Very interesting from a trajectory planning and control perspective.\n\nI've always loved mathematics and I've been pretty good at it. That's how I got into controls, motion planning, drones, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a foreigner, it's hard to work in the aerospace industry.\n\nThere are lots of restrictions. But I was lucky enough that my advisor had a small startup where he was actually commercializing some of his helicopters. The co-CEO was also an MIT research engineer. I got hired by a company, Aurora Flight Sciences, in November 2006.\n\nThe first six years of my career, I was working directly with a lot of faculty at MIT and doing really exciting research projects on multi-vehicle autonomy, so drones, ground vehicles, water vehicles, even space with NASA.\n\nAs you can imagine, very exciting intellectually, but sometimes it's a lot of small projects where you do small prototype developments, feasibility, and it doesn't really make it to an actual product.\n\nIt left me a little bit wanting in terms of having a bigger impact and actually developing real products.\n\nI moved to California right after I got married in 2011 and worked on self-flying cars at a company that's now called Wisk.Aero.\n\nI got to work on some pretty challenging problems. This was actually developing a real airplane from the ground up. So that was a little bit of a dream, a bunch of friends in a startup developing an aircraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlivier Toupet\n\nIt's a small world in robotics. I've never actually applied to a company. Of all the jobs that I've had to date, it's been friends reaching out to me to come work with them at that company.\n\nIn 2011, it was still a little bit early for self-flying cars. I think now they're starting to gain more momentum, but still probably a decade off.\n\nAnother friend of mine reached out and told me I should come join them. I decided to move to LA and go work at NASA. I figured after all the startups, why not work for a big company, and what better big company than NASA?\n\nI'm really interested by space and aerospace engineering, but my real passion was more airplanes.\n\nI was the supervisor of the Robotic Aerial Mobility group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nIt is kind of a unique place in the sense that it's called a FFRDC: Federally Funded Research and Development Center. It's at the intersection of industry and academia in the sense that you have some really cool research projects, but you also have really cool NASA flight missions, where you can actually infuse some of those robotics technologies.\n\nFor example, I developed the self-driving for the Perseverance rover, so now it can drive itself, on Mars, beyond the horizon. I got a medal from NASA for my work on traction control for the Curiosity rover, which helped basically reduce damage on the wheels. (Toupet received another NASA medal for software for the Perseverance rover.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got to drive the Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance rovers, as well as fly the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars.\n\nZoox\n\nI had a good friend who left JPL to go work at Zoox.\n\nI joined Zoox as a consultant in March 2015, and that was kind of ideal for me because I got to do cool stuff for NASA at a fairly slow pace \u2014 those space programs take many years to get to maturity \u2014 but at the same time, most weekends, I would be here in the Bay Area working at a much faster pace. It was kind of best of both worlds, and so that went on for seven years.\n\nZoox was acquired by Amazon. It was perfect timing.\n\nOne reason why it worked so well for me to be a consultant here: When you think about it, somebody may see it as just a few hours on weekends and so on. How can you be productive? The reason why it works so well is because there's a lot of technical expertise that I can leverage and that helps me develop things much more quickly than someone who would have to rediscover how to do things from scratch.\n\nI joined full-time in November 2021.\n\nZoox\n\nConnections are very important.\n\nIt's just all those strange coincidences in my life that ended up panning out. I don't know if I did anything special, except just following what I'm really excited about. To me, what's most important is the people with whom you work. If you look at my career, even though I really like airplanes, then I went to space and I went to AV, and it's not necessarily because I was that excited about AV or space, it is also because of the people I got to work with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are other AV companies, but I would never consider working for another one, because to me, the people at Zoox, they are like family.\n\nThe leaders of the company, CTO (Jesse Levinson) and CEO (Aicha Evans), are people that I look up to and that I admire. They're not just people who pay me every month.\n\nZoox\n\nThe AV space is the next frontier of robotics.\n\nI've worked on lots of autonomous vehicles, but always in some fairly small scope. What we're trying to do here in the AV space, it's extremely multidisciplinary. It's the entire robotics stack. You're doing perception, you're doing planning, you're doing prediction, doing simulation. Zoox is also doing the vehicle as well, so all the hardware. It's redesigning the whole robotaxi from scratch.\n\nIf we are able to develop that technology that can react faster than humans and doesn't get drunk and doesn't get tired and doesn't get sleepy at the wheel, that's a fantastic outcome of the robotics expertise I've developed.\n\nThe gain is proportional to the risk you take. If you always try to do something easy, then your accomplishments are not as great. I do think that technology for self-driving cars has some challenges, but we will get there. It's a frontier that we will reach soon and I think it's absolutely worth the challenge and the hard work.",

            "text": "A planned strategic update for Australia\u2019s burgeoning space sector is in doubt with the new government yet to back the $9.5 million initiative announced nearly a year ago, adding to industry concerns about lost momentum.\n\nThe Albanese government won\u2019t commit to completing the Space Strategic Update (SSU) promised by the Coalition in March last year because it is still considering its alignment with its own investment, technology and defence policies.\n\nOriginally planned to take 18 months to two years to develop by the Australian Space Agency, the SSU was to provide a \u201cvision\u201d for the sector through to the 2040s that united civil and defence space efforts with a more cohesive strategy.\n\nA space policy expert says while little detail has emerged since March, dropping the initiative would be a lost opportunity for the Albanese government and add to concerns in the sector it is being overlooked.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that the Albanese government gets this done,\u201d Australian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst Dr Malcolm Davis told InnovationAus.com.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t, then it really will undermine confidence within Australia and beyond about our country\u2019s space [sector] and you will see knock on effects from that that would I think be really counterproductive for us achieving some of the goals that we set out to achieve when the Space Agency was first opened in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Space Agency released a 10-year plan for the civil sector in 2019, aiming to triple the size of the civil space sector to $12bn. The Department of Defence launched Australia\u2019s Defence Space Strategy last year.\n\nIn March, then-minister for Science and Technology Melissa Price said the SSU would help unite the civil and Defence space sectors with better coordination of investments to develop a space sector that delivers both civil and defence capabilities.\n\nThe SSU was budgeted $9.5 million over two years from 2021/22 in the Coalition\u2019s March budget. But the initiative does not appear in the Albanese government\u2019s October budget and officials told an Senate Estimates hearing in November that the initiative and any of its uncommitted funding remains under consideration.\n\nA spokesperson for Industry minister Ed Husic has confirmed the initiative is far from locked in.\n\n\u201cThe Space Strategic Update was an initiative of the previous government,\u201d the spokesperson told InnovationAus.com\n\n\u201cThe Albanese Labor government will consider long term national space priorities in the context of our broader agenda. This will take into account government priorities including the National Reconstruction Fund, critical technology development \u2013 such as robotics, quantum computing and artificial intelligence \u2013 and the Defence Strategic Review being led by Deputy Prime Minister Marles.\u201d\n\nThe Industry department and Australian Space Agency, which had been set to begin work on the SSU in July before the change of government, declined to provide any indication on how much investment had been made in the SSU or if there was still a planned release.\n\nInstead, a spokesperson for the Australian Space Agency said it had been consulting with the space industry throughout the last year, with feedback leading to new products and better collaboration with states and territories.\n\nDr Davis said more information and a decision one way or another on the SSU is needed for the Australian space sector.\n\n\u201cIt is rather frustrating for those of us in the space policy sector to be kind of being kept out of the loop and in the dark on this very important document,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the case that the Albanese government is going to do a go slow on this and hold off maybe until after the next federal budget, then that\u2019s a bit frustrating too.\u201d\n\nParts of the Australian sector are frustrated by what is being perceived as a lack of commitment from the new government, Dr Davis said.\n\nThe Space Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) launched a broadside at the new government in September last year, questioning the Albanese government\u2019s commitment to the area and the placement of space within the Industry portfolio rather than Home Affairs or Prime Minister and Cabinet.\n\nBut the industry group has landed several meetings with the Australian Space Agency, the Industry department, and Minister, while individual space businesses have also met with the new government nearly 200 times since it was sworn in.\n\nFunding for space grant programs was also spared in the Albanese government\u2019s spending audit, although how it is distributed may also change.\n\nAn official government response was also provided to a parliamentary inquiry into the local space industry and its 38 recommendations. But there was little commitment to concrete changes and the response also suggested a wait for other policies.\n\nWith worsening economic conditions and an unstable geopolitical environment greeting the new government, some caution is understandable, Dr Davis says. But the clock is ticking for the Australian space sector and the SSU would be useful, he said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to leave it too long because if they leave it too long then suddenly you got to lose momentum. Companies and organisations are going to start losing confidence and that\u2019s when you get companies closing down and going overseas. Jobs are lost and it\u2019s just snowballs from there. \u201c\n\nDo you know more? Contact James Riley via Email.",

NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nHumans have sent many robotic vehicles to study Mars, nearly 34 million miles away from Earth.\n\nSix-wheeled rovers have a twin set of cameras that act like eyes and a mast that looks like a neck.\n\nThe robots take on \"personalities\" through their experiences and first-person social media accounts.\n\nWhen a Mars rover beams back a selfie, the mission's Earth-bound engineers and scientists feel like they're getting a FaceTime from a friend they haven't seen in ages.\n\nWe know Mars rovers are robots, but they feel like friends, or pets. What makes us feel so attached to them?\n\nThose who work closely with these robotic emissaries \u2014 as well as the public \u2014 tend to anthropomorphize them, or endow these inanimate robots with human qualities, and experts told Insider this can help the overall mission.\n\n\"In all NASA missions, people feel some sense of connection to the vehicle, whether that's a rover, an orbiter, or a lander,\" Janet Vertesi, a sociologist of science and technology at Princeton University and ethnographer in several of NASA's robotic space missions, told Insider.\n\n\"The robot is the thing that brings a whole community together \u2014 it's like a symbol for the group.\"\n\nWe're hardwired to respond emotionally to cute robotic faces\n\nEven scientists and engineers can't help but attribute human characteristics to space robots.\n\n\"It's the way the rovers are designed,\" Abigail Freeman, the deputy project scientist of the Curiosity rover, told Insider. \"Our brain is wired to make faces out of things that only vaguely resemble faces.\"\n\nThe first selfie NASA's Opportunity Mars rover snapped. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nTake the golf-cart-sized twin rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on the red planet in 2004.\n\nBoth rovers measure just over five feet tall and exceeded their expected lifetimes of 90 days exploring and gathering data on the Mars' surface.\n\nLike most modern rovers, the twins have a camera mast that looks like a neck.\n\n\"It really looks like a face, and that's on purpose from a scientific perspective,\" Freeman said. \"We have two cameras that are spaced about the same space as the eyes.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRovers also have robotic arms designed to work as a human geologist would.\n\n\"We're living vicariously through through these robotic explorers,\" Emily Stough, an engineer for NASA's Insight lander, told Insider. \"It's kind of like friends go on a great adventure and they take all these great pictures and you get to follow along from home.\"\n\nTheir ability to snap selfies on the Martian surface make them seem self-aware\n\nNASA's Curiosity Mars rover created this selfie in front of Mont Mercou. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nRovers are able to use the camera attached to their robotic arm to take epic selfies from the Martian surface.\n\n\"There's a certain self-awareness behind taking a selfie, and I think we can translate this to the rover,\" Katie Stack Morgan, deputy project scientist of the Mars 2020 rover, told Insider.\n\n\"Of course, we're the ones telling it to do that.\"\n\nPerseverance rotates its robotic arm. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\n\"What always struck me about the selfies is that like, how just a subtle tilt of the mast can kind of convey a different human emotion compared to a head-on, straight-on view,\" she added.\n\nRobot 'personalities' emerge by tackling challenges on Mars\n\nAs a mission with a six-wheeled rover ages, the robot's \"personality\" emerges.\n\nSpirit and Opportunity were two rovers that were totally identical in their design. But based on the different places where the rovers landed on Mars, they ended up having two very different experiences.\n\n\"Spirit got this personality where it was sort of a blue-collar worker, really down in the dirt grinding away. It needed to do a lot harder work,\" Freeman said.\n\nOpportunity, meanwhile, was known as \"Little Miss Perfect\" after it landed on top of geological evidence of liquid water.\n\nFull-scale models of three generations of Mars rovers, with Sojourner rover (center), the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers (left), and Curiosity (right) NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThen there's Curiosity, a car-sized rover that landed on Mars in 2012. Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lovingly started calling it George, according to Stack Morgan, who also served as a geologist for the Curiosity rover mission.\n\nThe resilient robot has had to overcome several issues throughout its mission.\n\n\"You get this feeling that the rover is tackling challenges, and those become very human actions,\" Stack Morgan said. \"Through the ups and downs of operating a spacecraft is when you really start to build that emotional connection \u2014 you really start to see them as a friend and partner who's struggling along with you. We're doing the Earth side of it and the rovers are doing the Mars side of it.\"\n\nNot all mission team members embrace this level of attributing human characteristics to a literal robot.\n\n\"For some people, the anthropomorphizing is going too far, because it would take away from the pressure to really care for the robot,\" Vertosi, the sociologist, said.\n\nThe public can engage with first-person accounts on social media\n\n\"Scientists do have a way of interacting with the rovers that really brings them to life. But it's not quite the same as the public,\" Vertesi said. \"NASA has really encouraged that because, you know, public engagement is incredibly important for publicly funded science. I think that's why we see so much of this encouragement of anthropomorphism among the public.\"\n\nThis started with LiveJournal entries for Spirit and Opportunity, ascribing them each their own personalities. Now, most NASA missions now have their own social media accounts written in the first-person.\n\nRovers, landers, and orbiters can even send heartbreaking farewell messages, thanks to their dedicated social media team.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nIt's hard to say goodbye to a friend\n\nFor the teams of hundreds engineers and scientists who work on Mars spacecraft, the end of a mission means the loss of a core team member.\n\n\"It's also the loss of a team that you have worked very hard and very intensively with for decades,\" Vertesi said, adding that she's been involved in several \"robot funerals.\"\n\nOn February 12, 2019, mission controllers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, sent the last commands to ask NASA\u2019s Opportunity rover on Mars to call home. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nTo bid farewell to NASA's plucky Opportunity rover in 2018, mission staff at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory decided to play Billie Holiday's \"I'll Be Seeing You.\"\n\n\"It's like a wake,\" Vertesi said. \"It's a celebration of life and the last hurrah for the team, as much as it is a way of grieving for and processing the loss of the robot for which they have intensively cared and dedicated so much of their lives to.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

Through the use of first-person social media accounts and anthropomorphizing by the mission teams, these robotic emissaries almost become friends as they explore the Martian surface. Rovers can even take selfies on the Martian surface - giving mission engineers a feeling that they are FaceTiming with a long lost friend.

            "text": "Since its founding in 2002, SpaceX has become a significant player in space exploration, and its stock is an attractive option for investors. With the potential for lucrative returns, it\u2019s no wonder that people are asking, \u201cIs SpaceX stock a good investment?\u201d.\n\nSpaceX is a private aerospace manufacturer based in Hawthorne, California. It designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002. Musk serves as CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX has four main lines of business: Space Exploration, Satellite Communications, Research and Development, and Build-Operate-Transfer.\n\nThe company\u2019s first two lines of business are related to the exploration and production of space. The third line of business includes satellite technology research and development projects. The fourth line of business includes building and launching commercial satellites for other companies. Although SpaceX was initially focused on building rockets for government contracts, the company now conducts most of its business in the private sector.\n\nAs of May 31, 2019, SpaceX has a market cap of $33.5 billion and over $21 billion in annual revenue. Its main competitors include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin.\n\nIn this article, we will analyze the pros and cons of investing in SpaceX stock to determine if it\u2019s possible to buy it in 2023.\n\nCan you buy SpaceX stock?\n\nHave you ever dreamed of owning a piece of SpaceX? Well, unfortunately, that\u2019s not possible yet. SpaceX is a private company, meaning its shares are not publicly available and not listed in the Stock Market.\n\nThis means that you can\u2019t buy stock in SpaceX, as the company is not public, and there hasn\u2019t been an Initial Public Offering (IPO) announced yet. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be a part of SpaceX\u2019s success. Even though you can\u2019t own stock of the company, there are still ways you can join the space revolution.\n\nVirgin Galactic, Momentus, Rocket Lab USA, and Boeing are all companies involved in the space industry. These companies have a strong track record and are expected to be profitable. They could be good investment options for investors in the space industry.\n\nSpaceX technology as an investment\n\nSpaceX technology is often associated with government funding and high-profile projects like the Apollo program. While these ventures are essential, they do not provide profit to investors. SpaceX, however, is a private company that generates profit from commercial contracts.\n\nTherefore, investing in space technology is a more reliable way to make money than putting money towards government projects. Investing in space technology is an intelligent choice if you want to make a profit. Another advantage of investing in space technology is that it is an up-and-coming industry.\n\nThe space industry is expected to grow as more people use satellites for communication, weather prediction, and navigation. As this industry expands, space technology demand will increase, leading to higher profits for investors. Overall, investing in SpaceX stock is impossible as the company is still private.\n\nElon Musk and SpaceX\n\nElon Musk is the founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. In other words, he is the man behind two of the world\u2019s most successful and innovative companies. His experience in the tech and automotive industries makes him a powerful leader for both companies.\n\nThis means that he will likely continue to make good decisions for Space X, which will benefit investors. Musk has a lot on his plate as the CEO of two major companies.\n\nNevertheless, he closely monitors both companies, ensuring they remain competitive in their respective markets. This demonstrates his commitment to SpaceX and his ability to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nAs a result, SpaceX continues to grow and prosper while Musk continues to lead the company toward greater heights.\n\nSpaceX Products\n\nSpaceX has a variety of products to offer customers. These products range from satellites to spacecraft. The company also offers launch services, which allow customers to send payloads into space. SpaceX also manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which launch payloads into orbit.\n\nAdditionally, the company is working on developing a reusable rocket system to reduce space travel costs. This system is expected to revolutionize the industry and make space exploration more affordable. Finally, SpaceX is developing a satellite-based internet service to provide global internet access. This service is expected to be available shortly and will be a breakthrough for the industry.\n\nOverall, SpaceX is an innovative company that has revolutionized the space industry. The company offers a variety of products and services that are beneficial to customers and investors alike.\n\nThe company manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft for commercial and government customers. SpaceX also offers satellite services, including satellite design, building, and operation for customers. The company\u2019s flagship launch vehicle is the Falcon 9, which can launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) and Dragon capsules into orbit around Earth.\n\nThe company also manufactures and launches the Falcon Heavy, which is expected to become the most powerful operational rocket in the world once it begins commercial operations. The company also manufactures and launches the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) spaceship, which SpaceX expects to be the first reusable and crewed spaceship in history.\n\nSpace industry 2023\n\nThe space industry is expected to expand as the world becomes more reliant on satellites. By 2023, the global space industry is expected to reach $1.5 trillion in revenue. This growth will be driven by increased demand for satellite services, such as communication, navigation, and weather prediction.\n\nAdditionally, developing reusable rockets and spacecraft will reduce costs associated with space exploration and make it more accessible to companies and individuals. As a result, more people will be able to explore space, leading to further industry growth.\n\nFurthermore, developing new technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics will enable companies to explore space more efficiently and effectively. This will create even more opportunities for investors in the space industry.\n\nThis growth will likely be driven by an increase in new commercial customers and a shift in demand from government contracts to commercial contracts. The growing need to improve connectivity and provide worldwide internet access will drive demand for more satellites.\n\nIn addition, the need to monitor and manage natural resources and environments will drive demand for more satellite data. As a result, the space industry is expected to grow from $304 billion in 2018 to about $420 billion in 2023.\n\nSpaceX is well-positioned to take advantage of this growth in the space industry. The company has already established itself as a leader in the industry and has developed various products and services that are beneficial to customers.

            "text": "Credit: Morocko / Shutterstock. The collapse of FTX has sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, hurting some of the businesses that raised the biggest deals in 2022.\n\nCrypto bros are in a tricky spot. After years of evangelising the benefits of a decentralised economy free of traditional finance and interference of regulators, they ended up crashing straight into those institutions in 2022. The collision has been catastrophic for the nascent industry.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that several of the 10 biggest confirmed crypto deals in 2022 were done by companies that ended the year with huge problems. That is, if they hadn\u2019t collapsed all together.\n\nTake FTX, for instance. At the start of 2022, it was seen as the golden boy of the industry. The trading platform cemented that perception by securing one of the industry\u2019s biggest funding rounds last year. However, the exchange collapsed 11 months later in a flurry of fraud and financial mismanagement allegations.\n\nMarket watchers have seen scandals like that throughout the year. They are concerned and wonder just how trustworthy the buoyancy of crypto deals in 2022 and earlier really were. Did those massive cash injections really reflect reality? What\u2019s next for the industry?\n\nFor the people behind some of the firms that have imploded, the answer is seemingly \u201call the way to the top.\u201d Take disgraced Three Arrows Capital, for instance. The founders behind the caved-in crypto hedge fund are reportedly attempting to raise money for a new venture together with the founders of the CoinFLEX exchange.\n\nThe crypto community has poured scorn over the prospect of another project from the tarnished team.\n\nFor instance, the CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute made it clear in a series of tweets that if anyone plans to collaborate with the new project, then they should expect it to be much harder to work with Wintermute.\n\nAnd since we are talking about cancelling stuff, if you are investing into coinflex/3ac \"exchange\" you might find it a bit more difficult to work with wintermute in future (on the relationship building side) \u2014 wishful cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) January 16, 2023\n\nThe Three Arrow Capital\u2019s founders\u2019 bullishness doesn\u2019t negate from the fact that the market chaos of 2022 certainly put a damper on deal activity in the crypto space. Investment into everything from crypto exchanges, non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralised autonomous organisations and blockchain businesses crashed last year.\n\nIn 2021, the industry secured $52.1bn in venture financing, according to data from research firm GlobalData. In 2022, that figure fell to $24.3bn.\n\nThat being said, several companies did raise hundreds of millions in cash injections. However, a closer look at where several of the crypto companies that raised 10 of the biggest deals are now paints a sobering picture.\n\nFireblocks secured $550m in Series E raise\n\nFireblocks kicked off 2022 by announcing a $550m Series E funding round. The round brought the startup's valuation $8bn.\n\nThe company builds tools for the secure storage and transfer of bitcoin and other digital assets. Fireblocks counts Bank of New York Mellon, share trading platform Robinhood and neobank Revolut among its customers.\n\nD1 Capital Partners and Spark Capital co-led the raise. Ten new investors also joined the round. Those included General Atlantic, Index Ventures, Mammoth, CapitalG, Altimeter, Iconiq Strategic Partners, Canapi Ventures, and ParaFi Capital.\n\nFireblocks followed up the round by achieving a Cryptocurrency Security Standard in December, apparently becoming the first crypto firm to get one since it was introduced in 2014.\n\nYuga Labs bagged $450m\n\nIf you've read about NFTs, then you've read about Yuga Labs. The startup is the creator of the Bored Apes Yacht Club, the NFT collection of cartoon monkeys that grew popular among A-listers during the pandemic. Several of the celebrities happily took to late night talkshows to drum up support for the NFTs.\n\nIt was on the back of that massive tailwind that Yuga Labs entered into 2022 and managed to close one of the biggest funding deals in the crypto space in the year to boot.\n\nIn March last year, Yuga Labs announced it had completed a $450m Seed funding round. a16z crypto led the round. A number of \"top tier game studios\" like Animoca Brands and its subsidiary The Sandbox also participated in the raise. Other strategic partners included LionTree, Sound Ventures, Thrive Capital and crypto payments infrastructure provider MoonPay also contributed.\n\nOne name among the investors jumped out: FTX, the disgraced cryptocurrency exchange that had a little over six months left before it collapsed.\n\nOf course, Nicole Muniz has no idea that one of its big backers would fold in a blaze of gory fraud allegations. Understandably, the Yuga Labs CEO was rather bullish when he commented at the time.\n\n\u201cAlready, a new economy is possible with the IP of Apes, Punks, and Meebits, owned by the community,\u201d Muniz said of the raise. \u201cThe possibilities for blockchain\u2019s impact on culture are endless, and so we are building a beautiful, interoperable world for people to explore and play in. There\u2019s a lot to come.\u201d\n\nOver the next few months, Yuga Labs would have reason to worry. Not only did the market turmoil reduce people's interest in investing in NFTs in 2022, but the people who had promoted the australopithecine JPEGs soon found themselves in the crosshairs of upset investors.\n\nSeveral of the celebrities who had promoted the Bored Apes Yacht Club \u2013 such as Justin Bieber, Paris Hilton, Madonna, Jimmy Fallon and Kevin Hart \u2013 have been named in a class action lawsuit tougher with Yuga Labs. The plaintiffs accuse the defendants of having unrealistically hyped up the digital assets.\n\nBasically, the accusation is that Yuga Labs and a number of A-listers used their status to break competition laws by not disclosing what they themselves had to gain from promoting the brand.\n\nThe suit was filed alongside a wealth of evidence outlining how Yuga Labs used MoonPay as an intermediary to compensate the people promoting the NFT collection, The Verge reported.\n\nStill, Yuga Labs is not out for the count just yet. In January 2023, the company announced an extension of its ecosystem that started with a free mont and a skill-based game called Dookey Dash.\n\nAny Bored Yacht Club holder owning a so-called Sewer Pass token will be able to play the game between January 18 and February 15. The people who get a high score will be able to transform their Sewer Passes \"into a mysterious power source\", CoinDesk reported.\n\nThe game has been linked with Yuga Labs' ambition to create a metaverse of its own called The Otherside.\n\nConsenSys secured $450m in March 2022\n\nWeb3 company Consensys started 2022 on a high note by announcing the close of a $450m financing round. The Series D raise pushed its valuation past the $7bn mark.\n\nParaFi Capital led the raise after participating in ConsenSys\u2019 Series C round in November 2021. New investors like Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Microsoft, Anthos Capital, Sound Ventures, and C Ventures also participated in the round.\n\nA string of Series C investors returned for the Series D. Those included Third Point, Marshall Wace, True Capital Management and UTA VC.\n\n\u201cI think of ConsenSys as a broad and deep capabilities machine for the decentralised protocols ecosystem, able to rapidly capitalise at scale on fundamental new constructs that emerge, such as developer tooling, tokenisation, token launches, wallets, security audits, DeFi (1.0, 2.0 and beyond), NFTs, bridges, Layer-2 scaling, DAOs, and more,\" Joseph Lubin, founder and CEO of ConsenSys said at the time.\n\nThose lofty aspirations seemed to have resonated with the investors that backed the raise. However, the deal and the backing didn't protect ConsenSys from the crypto chaos of 2022.\n\nIn January 2023, ConsenSys was said to be one of the many tech companies forced to trim their company headcount. The developer of the crypto wallet MetaMask is said to be planning to axe 100 or more jobs, according to a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. The company currently has about 900 employees.\n\nPolygon raised $450m by selling its native token\n\nPolygon Technology markets itself as a Web3 and metaverse company. It has developed a platform that enables blockchain networks to scale and connect. It most recently made the news as the platform that ex-US president Donald Trump used for launching his NFT collection.\n\nLike many other crypto companies that raised rounds in 2022, Polygon kicked off last year by securing a deal. It secured $450m through a private sale of its native MATIC token in a funding round.\n\nSequoia Capital India led the cash injection. SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Galaxy Digital, Galaxy Interactive, Tiger Global, Republic Capital and prominent investors like Alan Howard (co-founder, Brevan Howard) and Kevin O\u2019Leary (Mr. Wonderful from ABC's Shark Tank).\n\nOther backers included Transcend Fund, Makers Fund, Animoca Brands, ACCEL and global video game industry investor Scopely. However, the name that stood out was Alameda Research, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm. It was later revealed that Alameda Research had injected about $50m into Polygon.\n\nFTX secured $400m months before its collapse\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room. FTX. By now, the facts of the scandal that hurled the decentralised finance industry into an even worse crisis than it had already found itself in are pretty clear.\n\nThe founding rounds the world's former second-largest cryptocurrency exchange are, however, a good place to start. They provide a suitable backdrop to explain just how bad the collapse of FTX was.\n\nSo, let's rewind the tape to January 2022. At that stage, the cryptocurrency industry may have noticed a few black clouds on the horizon. Digital assets had lost some of their market share from their November 2021 peak. While the Federal Reserve had hinted that rising interest rates were coming and thus kicked off whispers of an oncoming crypto winter, lots of companies were still flying high.\n\nFTX was one of them. The crypto trading platform had entered 2022 on a high note. The firm had raised $900m in a series B funding round in July 2021. Then, in January 2022, FTX bagged another $400m.\n\nThe deal wasn't just one of the biggest deals raised across the crypto industry in 2022, but it also cemented FTX's position as a leader in the sector. The raise pushed the company's valuation past the $32bn mark. To put that in perspective, FTX was, at the time, worth more than UK bank NatWest.\n\nThe round was backed by Temasek, Paradigm, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, NEA, IVP, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, LightSpeed Venture Partners, Steadview Capital, Tiger Global, and Insight Partners, among others.\n\nCEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF, said the Series C raise would enable FTX to \"expand our global reach\", make more acquisitions and \"look to continue interacting with regulators\".\n\nBy the end of the year, SBF would certainly be able to meet that final goal, albeit not in the way he probably wanted to. In November, FTX collapsed following a series of events that had laid bare just how flimsy its finances were. SBF was ousted as CEO.\n\nBy then, regulators, market watchdogs and prosecutors had started to look into just how poorly mismanaged the company was and if its leadership had misappropriated user funds. In December, SBF was arrested and is now facing a number of fraud and money laundering charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe collapse of FTX has put the exchange's investors in an awkward spot. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly investigating whether or not FTX's backers did their due diligence and thus fulfilled their fiduciary duty to their own investors. The reports haven't named which investors may have some uncomfortable questions to answer in the near future.\n\nThe fallout of the FTX drama has also rocked the halls of Capitol Hill. SBF had poured millions of dollars into the pockets of politicians, helping them fund their campaigns. Consequently, he'd become the go-to guy for when the lawmakers needed insights into how to regulate the market. Those close connections are not looking so good right now. Market watchers have predicted that the crypto regulations those law makers were working on will be woefully slowed down by the firm's self-immolation.\n\nMarket watchdogs have used the wreckage as an opportunity to strengthen the policing of the crypto industry. For SEC chair Gary Gensler the collapse of FTX gave him a chance to double down on his crusade to bring cryptocurrencies under the purview of the regulator.\n\n\"Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws, risks to investors will persist,\" he said in December. \"It remains a priority of the SEC to use all of our available tools to bring the industry into compliance.\"\n\nThe collapse of FTX has also sparked a number of legal battles about who actually owns the business' assets, including its Bahamas properties and its $450m in Robinhood shares.\n\nWhile the crypto community has distanced itself from the fallen fintech firm, its disintegration has highlighted just how intertwined the industry is\n\nLet's take Genesis as an example. The crypto lender had loaned $175m to FTX before the company's demise. Once the exchange went up in flames, that dosh was gone.\n\nThat may have been manageable if Genesis hadn't already found itself at the wrong side of another collapse crypto company earlier in 2022. In July, Three Arrows Capital collapsed, taking with it $1.2bn of the $2.36bn it had borrowed from Genesis.\n\nConsequently, Genesis froze withdrawals, which put its clients in a really bad position. Customers who used crypto exchange Gemini's yield farming service, which sits on top of Genesis' platform, now found themselves unable to access their assets. This caused a very public and messy confrontation between the two tech giants, which culminated in Genesis filling for bankruptcy in mid-January this years.\n\nAnd, of course, FTX and its sister companies had invested in several other crypto businesses, as we've already seen in this list. So things are not looking great. And that's despite it raising one of the biggest crypto deals of 2022.\n\nNear Protocol secured $350m\n\nIn April 2022, Near Protocol bagged $350m in a new founding round led by Tiger Global. Other investors included Republic Capital, Hashed, Dragonfly Capital and \u2013 yup, here we go again \u2013 FTX Ventures.\n\nThe round marked the blockchain developer's second nine-figure round of the year, having raised $150m in January.\n\nNear Protocol said it would use the cash injection to \"accelerate the decentralisation of the Near ecosystem.\"\n\nOpenSea netted $300m in Series C round\n\nNFT marketplace OpenSea made a splash at the beginning of 2022 by netting a $300m Series C round. The raise saw its valuation swim past the $13.3bn mark. Paradigm and Coatue co-led the round.\n\nOpenSea CEO and co-founder Devin Finzer said the company would use the new cash injection to accelerate product development, improve customer support and safety, and \"meaningfully invest in the wider NFT and Web3 community, and grow our team.\"\n\nFast-forward to July. Finzer had dramatically changed his tune by then. In a tweet, he announced that the leadership had \"made an incredibly sad and difficult decision\" sack roughly 20% of its team.\n\nHe blamed the layoffs on the \"unprecedented combination of crypto winter and broad macroeconomic instability,\" saying that the cuts were needed to \"prepeare the company for the possibility of a prolonged downturn.\"\n\nToday is a hard day for OpenSea, as we\u2019re letting go of ~20% of our team. Here\u2019s the note I shared with our team earlier this morning: pic.twitter.com/E5k6gIegH7 \u2014 Devin Finzer (dfinzer.eth) (@dfinzer) July 14, 2022\n\nSimilar statements have been made all over the tech industry, not just the crypto space, when businesses have announced mass-layoffs in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAmber Global bagged $300m to make users whole after FTX crash\n\nAmber Global secured $300m in December 2022. However, it was clear that it basically did so to pay back users after the business' finances was affected by the FTX collapse.\n\nIn a Twitter thread, Amber Global said 10% of its total trading capital had been with the exchange when it crashed.\n\n5) While the vast majority of our clients and products remain intact, a few of our specific products would have experienced significant drawdowns as an aftermath of the FTX default, unless we could find ways to further protect those affected clients. \u2014 Amber Group (@ambergroup_io) December 16, 2022\n\nAmber had been valued at $3bn in its $200m Series B extension round in February, TechCrunch reported. Bloomberg reported at the time that the firm\u2019s valuation has slid under $3bn, despite the Series C cash injection.\n\nThe deal followed on the heels of a Bloomberg report claiming that the crypto trader has ditched a Chelsea FC sponsorship deal and is axing 40% of its staff amid market turmoil.\n\nBlockdaemon netted $207m in April\n\nBlockchain infrastructure startup Blockdaemon secured $207m in April 2022, putting its valuation at $3.25bn. The round followed from its $155m Series B funding round from September 2021.\n\nSapphire Ventures and Tiger Global co-led the Series C round. Existing investors Softbank Vision Fund 2, Boldstart Ventures, StepStone Group, Matrix Capital Management, Lerer Hippeau and Kenetic also participated.\n\nBlockdaemon said it would continue to keep building towards the \"decentralised future\" and add more acquisitions to its portfolio. It had previously bought staking and governance platform Lunie and blockchain solutions provider Anyblock Analytics.\n\nIt followed up on that pledge in July, 2022, by buying Danish digital asset security company Sepior.\n\nAlchemy raised $200m at $10.2bn valuation\n\nWeb3 developer Alchemy.joined the coveted decacorn club in February 2022 on the back of a $200m funding round. The raise put its valuation at $10.2bn.\n\nLightspeed and Silverlake co-led the investment. Previous investors a16z, Coatue, addition, Pantera and DFJ also participated in the raise.\n\n\u201cYou need three core elements to build a successful business \u2013 a high-performance team, a quality product, and a laser focus on customer needs,\u201d Ravi Mhatre, partner at Lightspeed, said at the time. \u201cAlchemy is at the top of all three categories, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re one of the fastest growing companies in history.\u201d\n\nIn August, Alchemy followed up the raise by acquiring etherum education platform ChainShot.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Verdict and its sister publications.",
