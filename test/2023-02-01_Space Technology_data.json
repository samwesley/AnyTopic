            "text": "With a growing pool of talented engineers and a supportive ecosystem, Central and Eastern Europe is poised for significant growth in the space industry during the next few decades, as regional startups are exploring new frontiers in satellite technology, space exploration, and other spacetech fields.\n\nOne of the key advantages of the CEE region is its proximity to established players in the European space industry, including the European Space Agency and major aerospace companies. This allows startups in the region to collaborate and partner with industry pioneers, gaining access to resources and expertise that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.\n\nThe development of the CEE space industry is also being driven by a supportive ecosystem, including government initiatives, accelerators, and incubators, and a growing community of space enthusiasts. All of these elements are helping to foster innovation and promote the growth of the industry in the region.\n\nThe European Space Agency plays a big part in the development of the sector throughout the region, with its Business Incubation Centres (ESA BICs) as the largest network of incubators supporting space related startups. The main goal is to support entrepreneurs with a space-based business idea and help them launch their products and companies.\n\nFor Macedonian entrepreneur and space enthusiast Dime Galapchev, we are already feeling the benefits of space technology, and this notion is only going to increase during the following years.\n\n\u201cIn 2023 most people enjoy the benefits of the modern age totally ignorant of how much they have space technology to thank for that. Starting from the need to minimize computers in the early days of space travel, the GPS, to nowadays the best optic cables and artificial organs to be manufactured in Earth\u2019s orbit. Knowing this I hope governments and the private sector in our region will wake up and start investing more as the space tech sector is the one that is going to expedite our progress because all humanity needs is a strong challenge and good engineers,\u201d Galapchev tells The Recursive.\n\nIn this article we will highlight some of the CEE spacetech startups and companies that are leading the way in this rapidly growing industry. From companies developing advanced satellite technologies to those exploring new frontiers in space exploration, these startups are pushing the boundaries of what is possible and shaping the future of space.\n\nCountry: Croatia\n\nWhat they do: Amphinicy Technologies is a provider of complex and technologically advanced software solutions for satellite machinery which help the satellites run in orbit and enhance their utility.\n\nAs the company outlines, its engineers have provided all-round support for satellite operators, equipment manufacturers, teleports, and multimedia and broadband service providers. \u201cWe consult our customers, collect the requirements, design the system and develop the tailored solutions,\u201d the company says.\n\nAmphinicy Technologies has been active for more than 20 years and operates in Luxembourg and in Croatia. Last year, the company signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) for the project \u201cRemote Agents for Cloud-Based Monitoring and Control\u201d, based on its Monica product, a monitoring and control framework for the satellite industry.\n\nThe goal of the project is to adapt the Monica software suite to be used in cloud-based systems, which represent a novel architectural approach with one central monitoring and control instance that communicates with lightweight Remote Agents.\n\nCountry: Bulgaria\n\nWhat they do: The spacetech Bulgarian company specializes in engineering, building, and operation of NanoSat\u0435llites and offers shared satellite missions that provides nations, companies, and even universities access to space.\n\nThrough its Shared Satellite Service, EnduroSat also aims to provide entrepreneurs, scientists, and technologists easy access to space, helping them to drive innovation at this final frontier.\n\nFounded in 2015, the company currently has a team of more than 80 people in Sofia and has proven to be fastest-growing space companies in Europe with an annual growth of 300% year to year.\n\nAt the end of 2020, EnduroSat joined forces with US-based space tech company Momentus for two service agreements: for the enclosure of Kuwait\u2019s first spacecraft and satellite mission, and EnduroSat\u2019s SPARTAN CubeSat in Momentus\u2019s Vigoride orbit transfer vehicle for the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch.\n\nAdditionally, EnduroSat is also working with IBM to provide developers and students around the globe with a fast and easy way to process space data before getting it back to the ground.\n\nCountry: Bulgaria\n\nWhat they do: Sofia-based Sfera Technologies has been established in 2019 as a spinoff of an aerospace engineering team, and its main product is called Homeport \u2013 a distributed ground station network for satellites.\n\nCompanies with satellites in orbit can use Homeport to find ground stations capable of obtaining data from the satellites based on price, data storage and processing options, and geographic availability.\n\nAdditionally, by using smart contracts and blockchain oracles, Homeport also allows space enterprises to quickly compose a virtual ground segment for its satellites, receive the data from them and fast-forward it to clients.\n\nSfera\u2019s approach also aims to enable space infrastructures to scale efficiently and through a decentralized approach which differentiates the company from other actors in this field.\n\nWith a background in aerospace engineering, the company\u2019s CEO Zdravko Dimitrov is also a co-founder of SAT-1, an initiative for bringing together talented people from Bulgaria in the field of engineering.\n\nCountry: Poland\n\nWhat they do: Creotech designs, builds, and assembles space systems, with extensive experience in designing, manufacturing, testing and assembling flight models of spacecraft subsystems.\n\nThe Polish company has contributed to a various successful space missions, including commercial and research satellites in Low Earth Orbit (e.g. ICEYE-X2, OPS-SAT), scientific payloads aboard the International Space Station (ASIM, DESSIS), and a Martian orbiter (ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter).\n\nThe company core team of over 230 specialists is supported by a strong research and development team, including additional engineers with an extensive background in complex electronics. Creotech also has production lines and AIT of microsatellites, and is working on a first 60 kg satellite IOD expected in the Q4 of 2023 and deliveries to Polish Ministry of Defence of a constellation in 2025.\n\nThey deliver their own solutions to the most modern and technologically advanced research institutions in the world, i.e. the European Space Agency, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research CERN in Geneva, the GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research or the DESY Research Centre in Germany.\n\nLast year, Creotech was a part of an international consortium led by the University of Innsbruck which was selected by the European Commission to build the first large quantum computer for the European Union. This international project aims to build a 100-qubit quantum computer by 2025 and achieve technological readiness to deliver a 1000-qubit solution by 2029. The Polish company is currently on the Warsaw stock exchange and has 25 systems or subsystems flying on large satellites.\n\nCountry: Poland\n\nWhat they do: SatRevolution is a space tech startup that builds small and lightweight spacecraft. Founded in 2016, SatRevolution main focus is on building nanosatellites, with a team of twenty people, mainly engineers, with experience developing applications in harsh environments.\n\nIn April 2019, the company successfully carried \u015awiatowid, the first Polish commercial EO satellite in cubesat standard, into Low Earth Orbit, as the company\u2019s technology demonstrator.\n\nNASA has also listed SatRevolution as one of only 12 companies in the world that comprehensively design, manufacture, and place observational nanosatellites collecting optical data in orbits.\n\nCurrently, the Polish startup is implementing the next steps to build a functional, commercial constellation of 1,500 observation satellites (REC) by 2028. At the beginning of this year, SatRevolution also signed a contract with the country\u2019s National Support Center for Agriculture (KOWR) for the development of the Satellite System for Monitoring Agricultural Crops.\n\nCountry: Slovakia\n\nWhat they do: Bratislava-based Spacemanic is a small satellite mission integrator, focused on delivering innovative nanosatellite solutions, platforms, and components. The company is a spin-off company from the Slovak Organisation for Space Activities (SOSA), which has successfully designed, developed, launched and is operating skCUBE.\n\nSpacemanic works in the field of design, development, and testing of fundamental small satellite components, such as onboard computers, power system units, and solar panels, with a team of experienced engineers in the fields of radio communication, and ground station design and operations.\n\nThe company has two labs equipped for space mission technology design and development, as well as a small testing facility for nanosatellite missions. One of Spacemanic\u2019s main objectives is to bring innovations in the matter of rapid satellite development and cut the time from order to orbit delivery to several months.\n\nCountry: Romania\n\nWhat they do: Digital Dryads is a Romanian startup that monitors and alerts deforestation using the European Copernicus satellites that constantly observe the planet.\n\nThe company\u2019s software monitors, analyzes, and alerts crops and forests by combining aerial and satellite data, while also detecting illegal logging in EU forests using state of the art satellite imagery (from Sentinel 2) and machine learning methods.\n\nFounded in 2020 with headquarters in Bucharest, their technology also extends to detect canopy stress due to fungi, diseases, pests, or droughts and to do crop analysis at an unprecedented scale.\n\nDigital Dryads also won first place in the 2020 edition of the EU Datathlon, an open data competition for startups and social enterprises.\n\nKnow any other spacetech startups from the CEE that would be a good fit for the list?

            "text": "It was just the beginning of 2023, when Elon Musk\u2019s re-usable rocket maker and satellite internet company SpaceX was in news to raise $750 million in a new round of funding that values the company at $137 billion.\n\nNow its German rival, The Exploration Company, is making waves for designing the first European space capsule that will use green propellants and open source its operating system. The European space tech company has now raised \u20ac40.5 million in Series A funding led by Europe\u2019s leading early-stage investors EQT Ventures and Red River West. Further, new and existing investors participated, including Promus Ventures, Cherry Ventures, Vsquared, Omnes Capital, July Fund, Partech, Possible Ventures, Habert Dassault Finance, Schlumberger and Sista Fund.\n\nAs a result of this investment, The Exploration Company will build a sustainable, reusable space capsule that can be used by private and public operators to fly cargo into space, resupply space stations, and transport humans at a later time.\n\nMaiden flights in 2024 and 2026\n\nThe startup has built its first re-entry demonstrator in 9 months, and is currently developing its second demonstrator that will fly into space and re-enter the atmosphere in a controlled manner, safely bringing back to Earth cargo payloads from clients \u2013 including several space agencies in Europe. There are plans for maiden flights to take place in 2024 and 2026, according to the company\u2019s press release.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Huby, Co-Founder and CEO explained: \u201cWithin this decade, we will see humanity expand into space and building space stations, sometimes in partnership with the private sector, around the Earth and the Moon, paving the way for humans\u2019 sustainable settlement on the Moon and beyond.\u201d\n\nRed River West Founding Partner, Alfred, Vericel said: \u201cThe mission of Red River West is to invest in European entrepreneurs who build global and impactful companies which we scale together in the US. We are proud to contribute to The Exploration Company\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nEQT Ventures Partner, Ted Persson, said: \u201cH\u00e9l\u00e8ne and the team have brought together a unique mix of world-class industry veterans and young space and software engineers to capitalise on a huge market opportunity and will ultimately enable Europe \u2013 and others \u2013 to participate in the discovery of the new space worlds, in a sustainable and cooperative manner.\u201d\n\nDemocratise space exploration\n\nDuring 2022, funding for space startups halved to $21.9 billion, the lowest level since the 2008 economic crisis. However, there is great potential for Europe\u2019s commercial space industry: estimates state the market will reach $40 billion by 2035 and $70 billion with human spaceflight. As of yet, there is no European solution for transporting people and goods to the space stations around the Earth and the Moon.\n\nFounded in July 2021 by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Huby in Munich, The Exploration Company has a team of aerospace engineers who have worked on some of the biggest space programs such as Orion-ESM, Ariane, etc. By providing Europe with the capacity to explore new space worlds, the company creates a sustainable, affordable and alternative global player, and has already signed several European space agencies as clients.\n\nIn addition, Munich-based space technology will commercialise its maiden capsule, Nyx Mission Odyssey, which will fly goods to space stations and return to Earth. Also, it will finalize and fly its second demonstration capsule, Nyx Mission Possible, which will perform a controlled re-entry into the atmosphere.\n\nBesides Nyx, The Exploration Company is also developing open interface software and hardware available in a SpaceStore, enabling customers to build on these open interfaces, and develop the platform that suits their needs.\n\nEventually, Nyx will carry humans and goods into space to service space stations and conduct long-range exploration. Moreover, the vehicle can be refueled in orbit, extending its potential mission duration. Moreover, it can be launched by a variety of rockets, making it launcher agnostic.",

            "text": "Leonard David (Inside Outer Space) and Joey Roulette (Reuters)\n\nThe Duke University Space Diplomacy Lab (SDL) was founded as a part of the Duke \"Rethinking Diplomacy\" Program in January 2022. The central objective of the SDL has been to provide a vehicle to advance thought leadership on the burgeoning field of space diplomacy through a multidisciplinary focus, working across its inaugural year at the intersection of emerging space trends and technology, foreign policy and national security, and diplomatic engagement strategies to advance policies and practices supporting a safe and sustainable future in outer space.\n\nDuring the SDL's \"first orbit around the Sun,\" the lab has considered diplomatic strategies to avoid conflict reaching orbit, whether it be through the emergence of commercial space assets as key tools to both understand trends and support communications and humanitarian efforts to support Ukraine's struggle to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity, or longer-term geopolitical trends associated with the possibility of future great power competition throughout the cislunar environment. The lab has also taken a detailed look at diplomatic engagement pathways to advance regulatory statutes and norms for the reduction of dangers associated with the proliferation of space debris in low-Earth orbit and beyond, including inputs from participants in a Space Diplomacy Hackathon that the lab hosted in partnership with the National Science Policy Network (NSPN). The SDL has also hosted multiple discussions on the vital role that satellite platforms have in delivering and coordinating humanitarian aid around the globe, while taking a lessons-learned approach to diplomatic and normative trends that can be applied in space from other terrestrial domains, including the field of ocean diplomacy.\n\nFor its one-year anniversary event, the Duke Space Diplomacy Lab will host its annual media roundtable on perspectives of space priorities that are likely to emerge over the course of 2023. The discussion will ask another set of space media members to discuss what they believe to be some of the most pressing space issues that the globe will face over the next year, both headline-grabbing launches, technologies, and innovations, as well as emerging trends that could have impacts for years to come. For this year's edition, the Space Diplomacy Lab is excited to welcome Leonard David (Inside Outer Space) and Joey Roulette (ThomsonReuters), who will offer their perspectives on space trends in 2023, moderated by SDL co-founders Dr. Benjamin L. Schmitt (University of Pennsylvania) and Dr. Giovanni Zanalda (Duke University) and in conversation with SDL members Dr. Lyndsey Gray (AAAS Science, Technology, and Policy Fellow), Prof. Britt Lundgren (UNC Asheville), and Ambassador W. Robert Pearson (Duke Rethinking Diplomacy Fellow).\n\nThe Rethinking Diplomacy Program is supported by a grant from the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation Endowment Fund.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nLeonard David is a space journalist, reporting on space activities for over 50 years. His most recent books were written for National Geographic, Moon Rush: The New Space Race (May 2019) and Mars: Our Future on the Red Planet (October 2016). The late book is the companion volume to MARS \u2013 a National Geographic Channel television series from executive producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. Leonard is co-author with Apollo 11\u2019s Buzz Aldrin of Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration (National Geographic, 2013).\n\nCurrently, Leonard is SPACE.com\u2019s Space Insider Columnist.

AB House has been designed for a growing family in Broek op Langedijk. Until the land consolidation in the early 1970s, the dyke villages of Broek, Zuid, and Noord-Scharwoude were divided into hundreds of small islands accessible by boat. Over time, a part of the islands has been declared a nature reserve and another part has become a residential area.\n\nThis residential area consists of individual pieces of land with a single-family house on it that is surrounded by water. Fragmented volumes and dominant pitched roofs characterize the architecture of these houses. Variances in the shape and size of the pitched roofs and window openings and differences in the brickwork set the dwellings apart from each other. With challenges such as the transformation of the existing housing stock, AB House is a modest, yet distinct example of how living in the countryside can be made more sustainable and adapted to changing demands for contemporary living.\n\nOne key starting point for the design of the renovation and transformation of the house was to keep the layout of the existing ground floor and to enlarge the house on the first floor by building up to the maximum volume as permitted within the urban regulations. To achieve this, a new roof and first floor have been designed, while the house retains the feeling of fragmented volumes on the ground floor. The roof and first-floor extension cover the existing brick construction and stand on a striking black steel structure.\n\nThe steel mesh wrap of the first floor and white painted brickwork on the ground floor give each layer its own character and sense of unity, regardless of the variations in the volumes. Deep sight lines and generous openings in the ground floor volumes connect the kitchen, living room, and office space with the outside, while the first floor with a more closed facade, specific openings, and wooden interior results in a confined and warm atmosphere with bedrooms and the bathroom.\n\nThe pitched roof, clad with corrugated aluminum, provides the house with its characteristic silhouette and ties the whole together. The rainwater gutter, traditionally a distinct feature of pitched roof architecture in arcadian areas, was made into a pronounced, yet whimsical architectural feature by way of a steel beam. Additionally, the house has been outfitted with abstract openings and prismatic forms in the black steel structure, such as a circle, a triangle, and a square.\n\nPrecise detailing of the aluminum finishings and a restraint material and color palette make the different elements come together in the plan, facade, and section. This transforms the one-dimensional house from the 1980s into a more layered and diverse piece of architecture that tries to fully absorb the qualities of the surrounding green and water-rich environment. The result is a house in which tradition and modernity blend perfectly.",

(Video: The Washington Post)\n\nListen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nA Japanese telescope spotted a glowing, whirlpool-like formation spinning through the night sky above a volcano in Hawaii earlier this month, shortly after SpaceX launched a navigation satellite into orbit. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight \u201cThe Subaru-Asahi Star Camera captured a mysterious flying spiral,\u201d tweeted the Subaru Telescope, which is mounted in Hawaii, from its English account on Jan. 20. \u201cThe spiral seems to be related to the SpaceX company\u2019s launch of a new satellite.\u201d\n\nFlying over the dormant Mauna Kea volcano on Jan. 18, the formation first appeared as a small, soaring white object before emitting an arc-like wave and slowly spanning out into a spiral. The spiral then faded into a ring-like shape, ending a stunning visual transformation that was caught on video.\n\nAt about 7:24 a.m. that day, SpaceX launched a global-positioning satellite into medium orbit using a Falcon 9 rocket that took off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFootage of the satellite launch shows the rocket blasting into a blue-and-orange morning sky, marking one of the company\u2019s first missions of 2023.\n\nSimilar spirals have previously been reported after other SpaceX launches. In June, one was photographed hovering above Queenstown, New Zealand, on the same day a Falcon 9 was launched into the air from the same Florida location.\n\nSimilarly, a glowing swirl was photographed by the Subaru Telescope above Hawaii in April after a Falcon 9 rocket launched a satellite into orbit.\n\nSome space-focused online communities have speculated that spiral shapes spotted after rocket launches are caused by the expulsion of leftover fuel.\n\nThe Subaru Telescope, which sits atop Mauna Kea, is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, a research institute. Last week, the telescope also spotted long, flickering beams of green light in the sky, which are thought to have come from a remote-sensing laser from another satellite.\n\nSpaceX and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

            "text": "Cutting fat from office space budgets would seem like a no-brainer for CFOs as the economy heads into what could be the jaws of a recession. But realizing real estate savings is likely to be a more complex process than in past downturns, experts say.\n\n\u201cWhat organizations now need to do is say \u2018ok, during every recession real estate has always been a line item that we look at\u2019 and so they\u2019re looking at it again,\u201d said Julie Whelan, global head of occupier thought leadership and research consulting at the real estate services firm CBRE. \u201cBut they need to look at it with that lens of how much they cut during the pandemic and where they think their headcount is going.\u201d\n\nThe halting pace of employees\u2019 return to office and the toehold that hybrid work now has in corporate work models leaves experts like Whelan pegging office utilization rates at about 50% of what they were before the pandemic \u2014 even as hard-driving executives like Elon Musk and JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon push hard to get staff back in their cubicles.\n\nThe latest round of office space cutbacks are playing out most visibly in Silicon Valley, the source of an almost daily drumbeat of announcements from high profile tech companies like Salesforce and Microsoft, many of whom are detailing layoffs and revising their real estate footprints. \u201cTech firms were famous for taking space to grow into. Then all of a sudden things came to a screeching halt,\u201d Whelan said in an interview.\n\nReal estate is a big cost center, with office space often the second or third largest expense for service companies after labor, Whelan said.\n\n\n\nStill, companies shouldn\u2019t swing the budget axe until they\u2019ve figured out what their office utilization rate is now as well as what their goals are for the total number of people they ultimately want working in the office, she said. Only then can they zero in on the delta between how many employees are showing up now and how many will show up later, and as a result, how they will manage real estate costs this year, she said.\n\nAs they sort through their portfolios of office leases, CFOs should also keep in mind that they are in the middle of another cyclical downturn in the economy, and that it\u2019s not possible to perfectly time their moves because it\u2019s too long a lead item, according to Eric Anton, senior managing director with the commercial real estate brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap. Office leases can extend 10 years or longer.\n\n\u201cYou can make a perfect turkey sandwich but if you had to plan how many turkey sandwiches you should order for the company in a year that\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s the same thing with office space,\u201d Anton said in an interview.\n\nHere are four evolving issues or unexpected curveballs that CFOs need to track when deciding how or when they will go about triming office space:\n\n1. Savings won\u2019t always come from lower rents:\n\nThe U.S. office market is signaling multiple signs of distress and in most but not all markets the tenants have the upper hand, experts say. But you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know that from a quick scan of most average asking rents, the set price buildings say they want for space.\n\nIn fact, Class A downtown space rents in the U.S. ticked up to $51.41 per square foot in the fourth quarter from $51.08 a year earlier, while the asking rents for premier suburban spaces were $33.58 last quarter compared with $33.58 a year earlier, according to a Jan. 26 Colliers report.\n\nOccupiers are gaining concessions such as periods of \u201cfree rent\u201d and money that landlords give to tenants to build out space or so-called tenant improvements. Buildings in some big markets are offering 12-month rent abatements or $100 per square foot or more in tenant improvement allowances toward upgrading space, according to Stephen Newbold, Colliers International\u2019s national director of office research, writing in a Jan. 26 blog post.\n\nThose rents will likely be pressured further this year. The U.S. office vacancy rate rose to 15.7% in the fourth quarter from 14.8% year-over-year, according to Colliers. If that pace continues, by midyear vacancies could touch the 16.3% peak not seen since the height of the Global Financial Crisis, Newbold wrote. The jury is out as to whether there\u2019s a market correction in the works, and there\u2019s considerable debate over the future of the U.S. office market, he wrote.\n\n2. Yes, location, location, location still matters\n\nIt\u2019s a new twist on one of the oldest real estate sayings in the book: location, location location. Employees are dictating a flight to quality office space, and companies who want to lure workers back to work in an office need to make it compelling and easy to get there, Anton said.\n\nThat is likely to be offices on top of transportation hubs such as Grand Central or Penn Station in New York City that minimize commuting hassles as opposed to the latest \u201ccool\u201d neighborhood, he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m coming in three days a week and I live in Greenwich, Connecticut or New Jersey or Westchester, I don\u2019t want to take a train and then a subway or a train and then have a 20 minute walk,\u201d Anton said. \u201cI want to come in and go upstairs and bang, I\u2019m in a class A trophy office building.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, there\u2019s a bifurcated market when it comes to where rents are weakest. So far, the demand for newer and more modern buildings with many amenities has held up better, experts say. For example, the average asking rent across all office rent classes was largely unchanged during the third quarter of 2022 at $35.23\n\nper square foot, but effective rents for top-tier properties in some of the largest markets increased by 4.2% last year through the third quarter, according to a CBRE report.\n\n3. Demand for office sale leasebacks wavering\n\nSale leasebacks are transactions whereby companies sell their office and enter into what is typically a 10-15 year lease with the new owner. They have long been viewed as a way for companies to monetize assets. In one of the latest large deals, Biogen announced a sale leaseback agreement in September with Boston Properties which gave the company gross proceeds of nearly $603 million.\n\nBut in recent years, investor demand for office property has cooled due to concerns about the outlook for the office market. Also, investors looking for property want to buy single-tenant office buildings, and even companies that own buildings will often have other tenants in them, according to Scott Merkle, managing partner at New York City-based SLB Capital Advisors.\n\nStill, Merkle said that sale leaseback arrangements merit consideration because the cost of the capital is still cheaper in the current high rate environment. The cost of debt for many middle market businesses rose over 400 bps in 2022, making sale leasebacks more attractive today than 12 months ago, he said.\n\n4. There\u2019s no magic per person space ratio\n\nHistorically, there has often been a discussion in real estate circles around the right ratio of employees per square foot of office space. Right now, that is no longer realistic given the differences from industry to industry layered on top of the different ways companies are aiming to mix in hybrid, in person and remote approaches to working.\n\nThen too, even as patterns for work are emerging, it\u2019s not altogether clear how to accommodate workers who may not all be in the office at the same time. For example, most tenants are adopting hybrid work with a minimum of three days in the office, according to Colliers.\n\nMany companies are settling in the increasingly embraced sweet spot of calling all employees back to the office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. From that point some CFOs are seeking to extrapolate how much space they\u2019ll need going forward.\n\nShared desks and other systems are changing the calculations companies are making. \u201cThe square foot ratio is almost a number that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore,\u201d Whelan said. Over the next few years, as companies adjust to the new work environment, CBRE estimates that companies will likely reduce the amount of space needed per person by about 15%, according to CBRE\u2019s U.S. Real Estate Market Outlook 2023.",
