            "text": "The Dominion Energy Innovation Center, an Ashland-based startup incubator, is adding a pitch competition focused on the nuclear and hydrogen energy sectors to its programming lineup.\n\nThe DEIC plans to hold the first session of its new Spark Virginia program in late February in Richmond. The program is aimed at budding startup founders in Virginia who have ideas for new nuclear and hydrogen energy technologies they have developed either independently or in university labs.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are a ton of commercial (intellectual properties) sitting in universities around the state,\u201d DEIC Director Adam Sledd said. \u201cThe idea behind Spark was to start setting up a pipeline program to bring these folks out.\u201d\n\nSpark participants will take part in a 24-hour session that will culminate in a pitch competition with prize money. Participants will be able to meet and collaborate with one another, learn from industry players and workshop their ideas with an eye toward commercialization.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you in the room with people who understand these industries and we\u2019ll wrap up with an opportunity for people to pitch and get prize money for the best ideas,\u201d Sledd said of the program\u2019s concept.\n\nWhile the program is set to kick off in Richmond, there are plans for similar sessions in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia in April. The Richmond session is scheduled for Feb. 23-24 at the Shift Retail Lab at 1235 W. Broad St., which is operated by VCU\u2019s da Vinci Center.\n\nEach of the three planned Spark sessions is expected to have individual pots of $8,500, from which awards will be doled out, Sledd said.\n\nSledd said the program was devised to encourage more Virginians to take the plunge on founding energy startups and to broaden the audience for DEIC\u2019s programming. The center offers an accelerator program, among other resources.\n\n\u201cThe accelerator program tends to be more later-stage companies,\u201d he said. \u201cOne question we have always had is why there aren\u2019t more Virginia companies. Our accelerator tends to mostly be companies from out of state. \u201d\n\nSledd said future Spark sessions could focus on additional climate-conscious energy technologies, such as electric vehicles.\n\nSledd said that the program\u2019s initial focus on nuclear and hydrogen sources was selected because of those sectors existing presences in Virginia and recent momentum behind development of those energy sources in the Old Dominion.\n\n\u201cThose are two emerging clean-tech fields where Virginia already has a lot going on and there\u2019s a lot of interest in Virginia leading the way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ashland startup incubator is funding the program through a $50,000 grant it was recently awarded through the Department of Energy\u2019s EPIC Prize challenge. Sledd said the initial funding is expected to carry the program through about four regional sessions. He said the center planned to apply for additional money from that federal program to further expand Spark.\n\nBeyond the creation of prize pools, the remaining federal grant funds are expected to be used to cover costs associated with the operation of the program, Sledd said.\n\nAbout a year ago, DEIC moved into additional square footage to double the size of its offices at 201 Duncan St. in Ashland, where the center is headquartered and rents out office space to companies.",

            "text": "With tens of thousands of layoffs across the technology sector, there seems to be an abundance of new talent, but this doesn\u2019t mean that tech startups can just snap their fingers and get the perfect employee. Navigating the hiring process can be a challenge, even for experienced entrepreneurs.\n\nTech startups are competing against big companies with bigger budgets, more established networks, and abundant resources. However, startups can be successful in hiring if they take the right steps to streamline and automate their workflows.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll show you five ways tech startups can navigate hiring challenges.\n\nWhat Hiring Challenges to Growing Tech Companies Face?\n\nHiring is hard for startups for several reasons, mostly related to their relatively small size and limited resources. The primary challenges include:\n\nLimited talent pool: Most tech startups are looking for specialized candidates, but they lack the networks and resources of larger companies, making it difficult to find the right people. Unclear job requirements: Smaller teams often struggle with defining job requirements and creating the right kinds of descriptions for more specialized roles. This makes it harder for candidates to understand what they\u2019re getting themselves into and harder for startups to target the right people. Convincing candidates to join: Finding job candidates isn\u2019t the only challenge. Startups sometimes have difficulty convincing candidates (especially experienced ones) that they offer something they can\u2019t get elsewhere. Working in a startup requires an entrepreneurial spirit that some candidates don\u2019t have. Budget limitations: Budgets are usually tight, which means startups must be very careful in how they approach hiring. Especially if the company receives funding, pushback from private equity investors might be the final nail in the coffin for an otherwise solid employee or team. Keeping talent: Whether it\u2019s a budget cut, company realignment, or team dynamics, tech startups often struggle with keeping their new hires for the long haul. Undefined company culture: Building a company culture from scratch makes it difficult to find those who fit the culture. It also makes it a challenge to attract those who may not be familiar with the company\u2019s values and mission. Shorter recruitment cycles: Smaller companies need things done quickly\u2014a job requisition can\u2019t sit open for several months. At bigger companies, this isn\u2019t as much of an issue. Lesser employer brand: Big companies tout their corporate branding, which is why so many people want to work for a Big Four company or other large firms. Newer companies don\u2019t have the same establishment in their respective industries.\n\nStartups face plenty of challenges when it comes to hiring, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t find success with the right strategies.\n\n5 Strategies for Navigating Hiring Challenges\n\nHiring isn\u2019t easy for any size business. The average cost of hiring a new employee is around $4,700, and hiring salespeople, tech executives, and other specialized roles can be even more expensive.\n\nHowever, with the right strategies, startups can navigate these challenges and find great employees. Here are five strategies growing companies can use to tackle their hiring challenges.\n\n1. Outsource to Contractors\n\nSome roles can\u2019t be outsourced. Salespeople, for example, need to be part of the team and understand the company culture in order to be effective. Without an effective onboarding process and continuous iteration, it is impossible for a new salesperson to find success. Certain roles are well-suited for contract or freelance work including:\n\nOnline marketing : It\u2019s cheaper to hire someone (or an agency) to handle marketing tasks like paid ads, SEO, copywriting, and design.\n\n: It\u2019s cheaper to hire someone (or an agency) to handle marketing tasks like paid ads, SEO, copywriting, and design. Web development : Instead of hiring a full-time developer, many startups opt for contracting. This allows them to hire developers with specific skill sets on an as-needed basis. This software development company has an entire remote development workforce.\n\n: Instead of hiring a full-time developer, many startups opt for contracting. This allows them to hire developers with specific skill sets on an as-needed basis. This software development company has an entire remote development workforce. Accounting, payroll, and tax compliance: Most companies don\u2019t need a full-time accountant. According to a 2020 CFO survey, around 90 percent of finance functions might be fully automated by 2025. There are plenty of software solutions that are making it easier and cheaper to get the job done.\n\nHiring contractors reduces the resources needed upfront, helps keep costs down, and allows startups to find specialized expertise with specific skill sets. It also opens up the potential to hire abroad, which can be a great way to save money.\n\n2. Leverage Technology and Automation\n\nTechnology and automation can be used to streamline the recruitment process, such as applicant tracking systems (ATS) for handling job postings, resumes, and applicant data.\n\nThere are also tools for pre-employment assessments, such as personality tests and technical skills tests, to help ensure that the right people are hired.\n\nIt\u2019s best to use some of these tools with caution; personality tests, for example, have been known to produce biased results. Automated systems can also be used to ensure that candidates have the right skills and qualifications for a particular job.\n\nIn addition to using artificial intelligence to automate the recruitment and hiring process, here are a few places you can use technology to streamline your workflow:\n\nLearning Management Systems (LMS) : A learning management system gives employees access to training materials and other resources. This helps them stay up-to-date on new developments in the industry, as well as get acquainted with your company culture.\n\n: A learning management system gives employees access to training materials and other resources. This helps them stay up-to-date on new developments in the industry, as well as get acquainted with your company culture. Data Analytics : Data analytics can help you track performance and uncover insights about employee engagement. You can use this information to improve training programs, reward top performers, and identify areas of improvement.\n\n: Data analytics can help you track performance and uncover insights about employee engagement.

Some CRM tools and HR software have built-in KPI tracking capabilities. Payroll: Automated payroll systems can help make sure that payments are made on time and accurately. Gusto, for example, is a cloud-based payroll software that can help you manage payroll, taxes, and other HR processes. When it\u2019s time to distribute tax documents, it will generate them instantly and send them automatically.\n\n3. Utilize Referral Programs\n\nEmployee referral programs are a great way to tap into your existing workforce for potential new hires. You can save time and money on job postings, recruitment, and onboarding by incentivizing current employees to refer friends and family.\n\nReferrals are generally easier to onboard and tend to have higher success rates since the new hires already know people at the company. And since company culture fit is partially indicative of future success, it\u2019s important to encourage referrals from people with similar values and goals.\n\nYou can incentivize employee referrals in one of the following ways:\n\nMonetary incentives like cash bonuses, and gift cards\n\nNon-monetary incentives like expenses-paid trips or free meals\n\nCompany benefits like additional vacation time\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that fostering a positive company culture from within is the first step to a successful referral program. Employees need to feel valued and appreciated to be willing to recommend a friend or family member, so make sure you\u2019re providing the support, tools, and resources they need.\n\n4. Focus on Retention\n\nRetaining your employees is just as important as hiring them in the first place. Investing time and energy into employee development can have long-lasting effects on your business, especially in the startup world. You can cultivate a positive company culture by focusing on the following areas:\n\nFlexible work schedules : Allowing employees to adjust their hours and take time off as needed can help reduce stress, leading to better job satisfaction and higher retention rates.\n\n: Allowing employees to adjust their hours and take time off as needed can help reduce stress, leading to better job satisfaction and higher retention rates. Employee development : Investing in employee development is essential for cultivating a successful team. Offer courses, mentorships, and training opportunities to ensure that everyone is up-to-date on the latest industry trends.\n\n: Investing in employee development is essential for cultivating a successful team. Offer courses, mentorships, and training opportunities to ensure that everyone is up-to-date on the latest industry trends. Recognition and rewards: Recognizing employees for their hard work can make them feel valued and appreciated. Consider offering bonuses or other incentives for exceptional performance.\n\nMost employees thrive when they feel supported and appreciated by their company, so it\u2019s important to ensure you are providing a working environment conducive to success.\n\n5. Work With a Staffing Agency\n\nTech startups have a lot on their plates, from product development to customer acquisition, most don\u2019t have the time to manage the recruitment process.\n\nWorking with a staffing agency can take some of the pressure off your shoulders, especially if you\u2019re only making one or two hires. Hiring an IT staffing agency for your tech startup can provide several benefits, including:\n\nAccess to a pool of pre-screened applicants who match your needs.\n\nFast turnaround time for hiring as staffing agencies are already connected to potential candidates.\n\nSpecialized expertise in recruiting and onboarding employees.\n\nThe ability to make sense of your unique business needs and goals.\n\nSome recruitment firms cost lots of money for candidate placement, but it\u2019s more than worth the cost. A professional recruiter can make a huge difference, especially when it comes to retention and employee-company fit.\n\nEssential hires\n\nHiring the right people is essential for any tech startup, but it can be tricky to navigate these challenges.\n\nBy utilizing referral programs, focusing on retention and employee development, and leveraging the services of an IT staffing agency, you can ensure that your startup has the right team in place to succeed.\n\nWith careful planning and the right resources, you can make sure your tech startup is off to a great start.\n\nShare this: Print\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nSkype\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPocket\n\n",

            "text": "Whatever success Japanese startup ispace Inc. achieves with its current mission to become the first private-sector company to land a spacecraft on the moon this spring owes to the makeup of the people who work for it.\n\nThe Tokyo-based venture is only 10 years old and its workforce of less than 300 employees comes from 26 countries. The company, led by founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada, has outposts in Denver in the U.S. state of Colorado and Luxemburg.\n\nIts lander, launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Dec. 11 carrying rovers, is expected to touch down on the moon in late April.\n\nThe development of the lunar lander came only four years after ispace competed in the Google Lunar X Prize competition with just a rover. At the end of the competition in 2018, with no winner announced, the company did not even have a spacecraft of its own.\n\nHakamada sat down with The Asahi Shimbun to explain his company\u2019s swift evolution and vision. Excerpts from the interview follow:\n\nQuestion: What was your approach toward the development of the ispace lunar lander?\n\nHakamada: My top priority was to demonstrate that we can put a lander on the moon after the shortest possible preparations.\n\nQ: A government agency\u2019s space exploration project normally takes at least 10 years from planning to completing the mission. How could you make it happen in such a short period?\n\nA: A common perception is that you cannot get ahead in space development unless you develop new technologies. But when it comes to landing on the moon, it is achievable by combining existing technologies. To build an opportune system for a lunar landing in the shortest possible preparation time, we needed to acquire and introduce technologies and components from across the world.\n\nFor example, Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in the United States, renowned for its participation in NASA\u2019s Apollo project, provided us with the Guidance Navigation and Control System software for our spacecraft\u2019s soft landing on the moon after it enters lunar orbit. As for the assembly of the craft\u2019s engine and the body, ArianeGroup, a European leader of space launchers, collaborated with us.\n\nQ: How could you get those big-name players aboard with a startup like yours with just a limited track record? Just asking them surely was not enough.\n\nA: Our engineers come from across the globe, and some had previously worked with those organizations. It was my desire to team up with Draper but we did not have any connections with the laboratory. So, we had to negotiate with a different party over the software. Then one day, the individual who led our engineering team at the time remembered someone who had worked with Draper in a joint project before. We tapped this connection to get the laboratory involved in our project.\n\nQ: When you entered the Google\u2019s Lunar X Prize competition, you were developing only a lunar rover. Now you have developed a lunar lander, a craft that poses far more technological challenges. How did it become possible?\n\nA: From early on, I have been aware of the need to have our own spacecraft if we want to ferry payloads to the moon on a stable basis. The need for it became more urgent after a group contracted with us to transport our rover withdrew from the Google competition. But the problem was a lack of funds. It requires at least 5 billion yen ($39 million) to develop a spacecraft. In the end, we were able to raise 10 billion yen thanks to backing from investors. Their investment made a difference.\n\nQ: Your employees represent 26 countries. Did you start out with the intention of creating a pool of international talent from the outset?\n\nA: It is only natural to pay attention to a pool of talent overseas, considering the market for commercial space activities. In addition, a startup cannot afford to nurture human resources from scratch. Recruiting the staff that we need, regardless of nationalities, led to the current workforce. When we offer positions, people apply as currently few businesses exist that set their sight on the delivery of cargos to the moon for the development of natural lunar resources.\n\nQ: Isn\u2019t it an arduous task to bring employees with such diverse backgrounds together for a shared goal?\n\nA: Getting what I meant to be positive taken as opposite by our staff happens all the time. But isn\u2019t it also the case between Japanese?\n\n(This article is based on an interview by Shiro Namekata, editorial writer.)",

            "text": "Visa, the payments giant, has made its first investment in Moov Financial, which provides a platform that lets companies embed payments into their software.\n\nMoov just raised $45 million in a Series B round led by Commerce Ventures that also saw participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, and Sorenson Ventures. Dan Rosen, founder and partner of Commerce Ventures, will join Angela Strange, a general partner at Andreessen, and Matt Harris, a BCV partner, on Moov\u2019s board.\n\nMoov has collected $77.5 million in total, according to Wade Arnold, Moov\u2019s cofounder and CEO. This includes a $5.5 million seed round in August 2020 and a $27 million Series A in December 2020.\n\nArnold has big plans for the fintech he founded in 2018. (He sold bank technology startup Banno to Jack Henry & Associates in 2014.) Moov provides an open-sourced platform that helps companies add banking and payment functionality to apps. It currently employs 72 people and has 15 open engineering positions. Moov plans to add people. \u201cAs a startup in the current economic environment, it\u2019s exciting to be a company with cash to hire and take advantage of the layoffs that are happening,\u201d Arnold told Fortune in an interview.\n\nTwo years ago, the competition for talent was much fiercer, he said. A company in 2021 might have had 20 openings for engineers but just filled two or three. \u201cIt\u2019s night and day between two years ago and today,\u201d Arnold said.\n\nThe B round represents Visa\u2019s first investment in Moov. The startup came to Visa\u2019s attention after winning the firm\u2019s Visa Everywhere Initiative in 2021. The competition features startups vying to create new opportunities for electronic payments, Arnold said. Moov placed first against a field that included several other fintechs such as Bitwage, Solo Funds, Alinea, and Republic.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been incredible partners from the beginning,\u201d Arnold said.\n\nCommerce Ventures, the VC that has funded Bill.com, Marqeta, and MX, invested in all of Moov\u2019s rounds. \u201cDan has been really helpful to Moov in the last two years. Dollar for dollar, he\u2019s the most useful investor over the last couple years,\u201d Arnold said.\n\nMoov spent three months raising the B round, in an environment Arnold called \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Last year inflation, the war in Ukraine, and recession fears caused the broad market to contract. This resulted in the valuations of public fintechs, like PayPal, Block, and Fidelity National Information Services, or FIS, to drop by about 30% to 50%.\n\nDue to the downturn, venture capitalists have pulled back on the number of deals they are doing this year, Arnold said. They\u2019re also doing more diligence to find confidence in their investments, he said.\n\nVenture capitalists often use \u201cpublic comps,\u201d or public comparables, for valuations of private companies. But when those comps plunge, it\u2019s harder for VCs to predict a company\u2019s trajectory, Arnold said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time to fundraise. Nobody knows what the future is\u2026It\u2019s easier for most VCs to do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not all is gloomy for fintechs. Online payment giant Stripe, an oft-mentioned IPO candidate, may finally go public. Cofounders Patrick and John Collison told employees in a Jan. 26 email that the company will either publicly list itself within a year or allow employees to privately sell shares, according to The Information. Stripe is expected to use a direct listing to tap the public markets, the story said. The company raised $600 million in a Series H round in March 2021 that valued Stripe at about $95 billion.\n\nStripe would be the most valuable fintech ever to IPO, Arnold said. \u201cTheir growth and valuation are unprecedented in the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nA Stripe listing, if it traded above $100 billion, is the signal that investors need to keep funding companies, Arnold said. \u201cIt would be a vote of confidence in emerging fintech companies. It [would] be a great example of a modern fintech leapfrogging the incumbents by both product and valuation,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if Moov might ever go public, Arnold said, \u201cWe have great aspirations to build a market-changing company\u2026It would be a privilege to do that for our employees and investors.\u201d",

Please enable JavaScript\n\nStarting a business can be daunting, but there\u2019s an alternative option that you may not have considered: the stealth startup. A stealth startup is a low-profile approach to launching and running your business without any fanfare or publicity\u2014but it still comes with its benefits and challenges. This blog post will look closely at what exactly makes up a stealth startup, why it might be worth considering for your next venture, and how to run one successfully. From identifying potential pitfalls to gaining valuable tips from experienced entrepreneurs who\u2019ve gone down this path before you, let\u2019s dive into the world of the stealth startup.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat is a Stealth Startup?\n\nA stealth startup is a business that operates in secret, often without the knowledge of its competitors or the public. It is typically used by entrepreneurs who want to keep their ideas and plans confidential until they are ready to launch their product or service.\n\nThe idea behind a stealth startup is to protect intellectual property from being stolen or copied by competitors while also giving the entrepreneur time to refine their product before it goes live. This can be especially important for startups working on innovative products with no existing market competition. By keeping things under wraps, they can ensure that when they finally launch, they have the edge over potential rivals.\n\nStealth startups usually require more resources than traditional businesses since there\u2019s no way of gauging customer demand ahead of time and, therefore, must rely heavily on research and development (R&D). This means investing in talented staff members who understand the technology needed for success and marketing professionals who know how best to reach customers once the product launches. Additionally, funding may need to come from venture capitalists instead of banks due to the high risk associated with such ventures.\n\nAnother challenge stealth startups face is maintaining secrecy during fundraising rounds; investors will likely want detailed information about what\u2019s being developed, which could compromise security if shared too widely. To get around this issue, some entrepreneurs choose not to disclose anything until after their product has been released into the market \u2013 which carries its risks since investors may be unwilling to invest without knowing precisely what they\u2019re getting into first.\n\nA stealth startup is a great way to test an idea without drawing attention from competitors, allowing you to get feedback and make improvements before launching publicly. Now let\u2019s look at the benefits of a stealth startup.\n\nKey Takeaway: A stealth startup requires more resources and can be risky, but it offers the potential to keep ideas confidential and gain an edge over competitors. Key elements: R&D, talented staff, marketing professionals, venture capital funding, and secrecy during fundraising rounds.\n\nBenefits of a Stealth Startup\n\nStealth startups offer entrepreneurs a unique opportunity to develop their products and services without worrying about competitors stealing their ideas. This allows them to focus on perfecting the product or service before launching it rather than rushing it out to beat the competition.\n\nProtection of Intellectual Property:\n\nA stealth startup also protects intellectual property. By keeping the idea under wraps until launch, entrepreneurs can ensure that no one else can copy or steal their ideas. This is especially important for businesses that rely heavily on proprietary technology or processes. It also gives them time to file patents and trademarks before going public with their concept.\n\nAvoid Costly Mistakes:\n\nFinally, a stealth startup helps entrepreneurs avoid costly mistakes by allowing them time and space away from prying eyes so they can refine their business model without fear of criticism or ridicule from potential competitors. They are free to experiment with different approaches and strategies without feeling pressure from outside sources who may not have the same vision as they do for the company\u2019s future success. In addition, this period of secrecy allows founders to work out any kinks in operations before taking things public\u2014saving both money and embarrassment if something goes wrong after launch day has already passed.\n\nBenefits of Stealth Mode:\n\nThe benefits of a stealth startup are numerous, but it is essential to be aware of the potential challenges that come with this approach. So let\u2019s explore those now.\n\nKey Takeaway: The key takeaway from stealth startups is that they offer entrepreneurs the opportunity to perfect their products and services, protect their intellectual property, and avoid costly mistakes. Benefits include: -Time to refine business model -Protection of IP -Avoidance of criticism or ridicule -Experimentation with different strategies.\n\nChallenges of a Stealth Startup\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of running a stealth startup is keeping your business under wraps. It can be challenging to attract investors and customers without revealing any information about the company or its products/services. You must find creative ways to get the word out, such as using social media influencers or word-of-mouth marketing. Additionally, it can be hard to build trust with potential partners when they don\u2019t know anything about the company.\n\nAnother challenge is staying focused on your goals while maintaining secrecy. When trying to keep things under wraps, it can be easy to lose sight of what you\u2019re trying to accomplish regarding product development and growth strategy. Therefore, you must stay organized and prioritize tasks so that nothing falls through the cracks during this process.\n\nThe final challenge is managing expectations from stakeholders unaware of what\u2019s happening behind closed doors at your startup. Without being able to share details with them, it may seem like progress isn\u2019t being made quickly enough for their liking \u2013 even if there has been significant progress made internally. To avoid this issue, make sure everyone involved understands why secrecy is necessary and set realistic timelines for when certain milestones will be achieved (even if those dates are subject to change).\n\nRunning a stealth startup comes with unique challenges. Still, it also offers many advantages \u2013 namely, more control over how much information gets released into the public domain before launch day arrives. With careful planning and communication between all parties involved, these obstacles can easily be overcome so that entrepreneurs can focus on building successful businesses without having their ideas stolen by competitors before they even get off the ground.\n\nStarting a stealth startup can be challenging, but understanding the obstacles and planning accordingly will help you navigate them successfully. So first, let\u2019s look at how to run a stealth startup.\n\nKey Takeaway: Running a stealth startup can be difficult, but with careful planning and communication between all parties involved, entrepreneurs can overcome the challenges of maintaining secrecy while still focusing on product development and growth strategy. Key elements to success include creative marketing strategies, setting realistic timelines, and managing expectations from stakeholders.\n\n7 Examples of Stealth Startups That Made it\n\nLaunching in steal mode is risky but can pay off big if done right. Here are seven examples of stealth startups that made it:\n\nCisco\u2019s CTO departed in 2014 to start his own business, keeping the specifics under wraps. After debuting publicly, they received $144 million in venture capital to improve networking with artificial intelligence and were eventually sold Mist Systems to Juniper Networks for $405 million just five years later.\n\nVelo3D is an interesting 3D printing startup founded by Benny Buller after a long career as an executive in the energy and industrial industries. They have raised $22 million, allowing them to produce unique 3D-printed metal parts for precision industry demands.\n\nCoda was once known as Krypton and was created by Shishir Mehrotra, a former YouTube executive who managed to raise over $400 million pre-launch value before revealing what he was working on \u2013 something that would eventually murder Excel in cold blood. Now Coda is preferred by some of the most well-known organizations like TED, Figma, The New York Times, Buzzfeed, and Uber.\n\nProprio Vision is another example of a successful stealth startup using light field technology. It AI to replace microscopes, loupes displays, etc., creating virtual pictures of the human body and providing surgeons with more extensive data than ever before possible.\n\nAnother success story comes from Airtable, which started as \u2018Infinite Redshift back when its founders were still working at Google Ventures (GV). They managed to secure funding from GV while remaining secretive about their product until launching Airtable two years later \u2013 now valued at over $2 billion.\n\nOmada Health began life as \u2018Project Gingerbread\u2019 back in 2011 when its founders decided not only to keep quiet about what they were building but also moved away from Silicon Valley into San Francisco, where no one knew them or their project. As a result, Omada Health became one of America\u2019s leading digital health companies offering programs designed for people suffering from chronic conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.\n\nFinally, we have Cloudflare, who kept everything hush-hush during development stages even though investors showed interest early on due partly because CEO Matthew Prince refused to disclose details about what he was doing or how much money he had raised until after launch day \u2013 now worth around 10 billion dollars.\n\nHow to Run a Stealth Startup\n\nRunning a stealth startup effectively allows entrepreneurs to develop their products or service secretly while building relationships with potential investors and partners. The key to success is having all the necessary legal documents before launching publicly.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s essential to understand a stealth startup: It\u2019s when entrepreneurs create and launch a business without announcing its existence until they are ready to do so. This allows them time to perfect their product/service and build relationships with potential investors and partners who can help them launch successfully.\n\nBenefits of a Stealth Startup:\n\nOne of the main benefits of running a stealth startup is that it gives entrepreneurs time to perfect their product or service without any public scrutiny or competition from other businesses entering the market simultaneously. Additionally, it provides entrepreneurs more control over how they introduce themselves and announce their presence in the market.\n\nWhile many advantages are associated with running a stealth startup, this approach also has some challenges. These include difficulty finding funding since most venture capitalists prefer investing in companies that have already launched publicly; lack of feedback from customers, which could lead to costly mistakes down the line; and difficulty protecting intellectual property since competitors may be able to copy your ideas if you don\u2019t defend yourself legally beforehand.\n\nRunning a stealth startup can be tricky, but with the right strategies and tips, you can ensure your business is thriving. In the next section, let\u2019s look at some tips for running a stealth startup.\n\nKey Takeaway: A stealth startup can benefit entrepreneurs, allowing them to perfect their product service and build relationships with potential investors without public scrutiny. However, it\u2019s essential to have the necessary legal documents in place beforehand and be aware of challenges such as difficulty finding funding and protecting intellectual property.\n\nTips for Running a Stealth Startup\n\nRunning a stealth startup can be a great way to get your business without too much public scrutiny. Here are some tips for making it successful:\n\nCreate an Effective Marketing Strategy:\n\nBefore you launch publicly, create an effective marketing strategy that will help you reach potential customers. Consider their platforms and how best to target them with your message. Think about using digital advertising, influencer marketing, or even traditional methods like radio and print ads.\n\nCreate an Online Presence:\n\nEven if it\u2019s not visible to the public, creating an online presence is essential for any business. Create a website that outlines your product or service in detail and provides contact information so people can reach out when you\u2019re ready to launch publicly. You should also consider setting up social media accounts on popular platforms such as LinkedIn or Twitter so people can find out more about your company before you officially launch.\n\nConnect With Potential Partners & Investors:\n\nSocial media is also an excellent tool for connecting with potential partners and investors who may be able to help you get off the ground successfully once you do decide to go public with your venture. Use these networks strategically by engaging in conversations related to your industry, joining entrepreneurship-related groups, and building relationships with other professionals who could potentially provide valuable advice or resources.\n\nThese are just some of the ways entrepreneurs can make their stealth startups successful when launching publicly later on down the road. By taking advantage of digital tools such as social media and creating an effective marketing plan ahead of time, businesses have greater chances of success going live. Utilizing these tips can help ensure that your business is well-prepared for its public launch and ready to take off.\n\nWith the right strategy and planning, stealth startups can be a great way to launch a business without drawing too much attention. However, common mistakes should be avoided when running a stealth startup \u2013 let\u2019s look at those next.\n\nKey Takeaway: Take advantage of digital tools such as social media, create an effective marketing plan, and build relationships with potential partners and investors to ensure your stealth startup is well-prepared for its public launch.\n\nCommon Mistakes When Running a Stealth Startup\n\nWhen running a stealth startup, entrepreneurs must be mindful of the potential pitfalls that can occur. For example, not having all the necessary legal documents before launching publicly is one mistake to avoid. This includes incorporating your business, obtaining any required licenses and permits, and filing for trademarks or copyrights if applicable. Failing to do so could lead to costly litigation down the road.\n\nAnother common mistake is not focusing enough on developing relationships with potential partners or investors. Building solid relationships with key players in your industry can help you secure the funding and resources needed for success. It\u2019s also essential to have an effective marketing strategy when running a stealth startup, as it will help you reach more customers and build brand awareness quickly without spending too much money upfront.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about social media, either. Utilizing platforms like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook are great ways to network with other professionals in your field while building trust with current and future customers. In addition, these channels offer valuable insights into customer behavior, which can inform product development decisions.\n\nFrom overlooking the importance of market research to not having a clear plan for success, it\u2019s easy to make mistakes when running a stealth startup. In conclusion, understanding these common pitfalls can help entrepreneurs create and maintain successful businesses. Let\u2019s now move on to the next heading: Conclusion.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs stealth startup a real company?\n\nNo, a stealth startup is not a real company. It is an idea or concept that some entrepreneurs use to describe their approach to launching a business without publicizing it until the product or service has been fully developed and tested. Stealth startups typically focus on creating innovative products and services secretly before revealing them to the public when they are ready for launch.\n\nWhat is stealth mode in a startup?\n\nStealth mode is a term used to describe the practice of launching a startup without any public announcement or promotion. This allows the company to develop and test its product in relative secrecy while also avoiding competition from larger companies that may be able to replicate their ideas. Stealth mode can help startups build an initial customer base before the official launch and protect them from potential legal issues if their product is publicly available too soon. It can also give startups time to refine their business model and ensure they are ready for success when they go public.\n\nWho is the CEO of the stealth startup?\n\nThe CEO of a stealth startup is not publicly known. The company has chosen to remain anonymous and keep its leadership team private to protect its innovative ideas and strategies. This allows them to stay ahead of the competition while keeping their plans confidential until they are ready for launch. As a result, the identity of the CEO remains unknown.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt requires careful planning and execution, but it also has many benefits, such as low overhead costs and the ability to test out ideas before going public. While some challenges come with running a stealth startup, such as being unable to access specific resources or having limited funding options, these can be overcome with proper preparation and research. You can ensure your stealth startup successfully achieves its goals with the right approach.\n\nAre you an entrepreneur looking to start a stealth startup?

            "text": "(Getty Images)\n\nIf you want to see a classic case of how President Joe Biden's regulatory tendencies are strangling the U.S. economy and raising prices, look no further than the latest Justice Department efforts to kill an airline merger that is pro-consumer.\n\nJetBlue has its sights on merging with a smaller and financially ailing airline, Spirit.\n\nJetBlue's management believes the synergies between the two airlines will save over $300 million in costs. Spirit's shareholders (i.e., the airline's owners) have voted to approve the merger.\n\nSpirit is like a cancer patient in chemotherapy. Industry analysts say that there's a 50-50 chance Spirit will go bankrupt without a suitor. A bankruptcy would crush Spirit shareholders, cause thousands of airline workers to lose their jobs, and enable other bigger airlines to swoop in and purchase its assets and its valuable airport landing rights at fire sale prices.\n\nNo one benefits from that scenario.\n\nSo, what's the holdup here? The Biden Justice Department is holding up the marriage on questionable antitrust grounds.\n\nA strong case could be made that a successful merger between the two smaller airlines will enhance competition and lower prices by creating a larger discount airline. Today, about 70% of domestic flights are on four carriers -- American, Delta, Southwest and United. JetBlue controls just about 6% of the market (while Spirit's has shrunk to about 4%).\n\nA merger like this is hardly going to allow JetBlue to monopolize the market or drive up prices. Regulators are concerned that in certain markets like Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the two airlines directly compete, ticket prices may rise. This ignores that without the merger, Spirit may simply close.\n\nJetBlue is ranked as one of the best airlines for customer satisfaction. To compete more effectively with the big boys, it needs scale.\n\nAccording to JetBlue's merger plans, the airline will leverage the infrastructure, employees and management of Spirit to schedule 1,700 more flights to 125 cities in 30 countries. This benefits -- it doesn't hurt -- consumers with more choices.\n\nJetBlue's market niche has always been to compete in crowded markets by offering discount prices.\n\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology study has found that when JetBlue enters a market, it reduces airline fares by $32 each way on average.\n\nFederal regulators in the Biden administration don't seem to understand that mergers and acquisitions are a routine and vital component of an innovative and entrepreneurial economy. Investors are willing to put millions of dollars at risk to launch startups in the hope that they will have an exit option at some point of being bought out by more sizable competitors.\n\nHow many people will invest in a startup airline in the future if the feds would prohibit the company from ever being sold? Or prohibit the company from growing by acquiring other assets as it grows?\n\nThe birth of the modern age in air travel began some 40 years ago when airline pricing and routing were almost entirely deregulated. Thanks to steadily falling airfares, airline travel, which was once the purview of the rich, has become affordable to middle- and even low-income travelers with fares as low as $100.\n\nThe irony of all of this is that if the JetBlue-Spirit marriage is prohibited or killed through interminable delays, the people who will be uncorking the champagne bottles will be the executives at American, Delta, Southwest and United.\n\nIn the name of helping consumers, the Biden administration may take the side of the biggest and most expensive airlines instead of the pro-competitive forces of a disruptive and lower-price carrier. How this would help consumers is anyone's guess.",

This creates delays for consumers, who can easily leave for a competitive offering. And the stakes are very high: Without a clear understanding of how to identify trustworthy and creditworthy customers, financial institutions are at risk of being defrauded by cybercriminals or rejecting worthy applicants (resulting in millions of unbanked, \u201cthin file,\u201d and credit invisible consumers).\n\n\u201cWe set out to help solve the uncertainty faced by risk teams everywhere by building artificial intelligence based on the heuristics used by manual review teams. So for the first time ever, they can build digital trust by quickly analyzing billions of data points with a high degree of accuracy and uncovering insights that were previously invisible to the human eye. Technologies that make what\u2019s invisible, visible (like the telescope, the microscope, the x-ray) have always moved society forward in very powerful and important ways,\u201d\n\nsaid Inscribe co-founder and CEO Ronan Burke.\n\n\u201cOur mission at Inscribe is to create a fair and efficient financial services ecosystem. We\u2019ve started by building best-in-class document fraud detection so companies can uncover the Risk Intelligence they need to build digital trust with customers. And this is only the beginning.\u201d\n\nAccording to Deloitte, 79% of financial institutions said that enhancing the quality, availability, and timeliness of risk data was a top priority even prior to the pandemic. Risk Intelligence is a powerful new way for risk teams to identify fraudulent/legitimate and risky/creditworthy customers. Instead of relying on tedious, subjective, and error-prone manual reviews, companies that use Risk Intelligence software are equipped with AI-powered fraud and credit insights that eliminate uncertainty and make risk decisions easier.\n\nThe new funding will support Inscribe\u2019s impressive growth, hiring goals, and state-of-the-art innovations in fraud detection. In addition to seeing a 3x increase in ARR and a 4x increase in monthly usage during 2022, Inscribe saw its customer base expand into new areas of financial services.
