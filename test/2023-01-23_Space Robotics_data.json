In-depth research has been compiled to provide the most up-to-date information on key aspects of the worldwide market. This research report covers major aspects of the Clean Room Robot Market including drivers, restraints, historical and current trends, regulatory scenarios, and technological advancements. The industry\u2019s role on the COVID-19 outbreak was comprehensively studied. During a specific period, a full risk evaluation and industry recommendations were made for Clean Room Robot. This report compares the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 marketplaces. The impact of COVID-19 on the regional economy is also taken into account in the research.\n\n\u201cThe clean room robot market size is valued at USD 12.05 billion by 2029 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10.9% in the forecast period of 2023 to 2029. \u201c\n\nGet a live sample copy->\n\nhttps://www.marketinsightsreports.com/reports/120510913819/global-clean-room-robot-industry-research-report-growth-trends-and-competitive-analysis-2022-2028/inquiry?Mode=Shruti24\n\nThe Top Major Prominent Players are: ABB, YASKAWA, FAUNC, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, KUKA, Mitsubishi Electric, DENSO, NACHI-FUJIKOSHI, EPSON, OMRON Corporation, Universal Robots, Aerotech, IAI, Staubli, Yamaha, Hirata, S T Robotics, Techman Robot, TRAPO AG\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn December 2020, ABB (Switzerland) launched the clean room version of IRB 1100 with the entire body being certified with IP67 rating. The robot is suitable for applications generating substantial dust, water, and debris, including 3C polishing, wet grinding, buffing, and deburring.\n\nIn August 2020, KUKA (Germany) launched a mobile clean room robot for the manufacture of semiconductor wafers. The mobile robot helps in the transfer of wafers from one step to another. The mobile manipulation application consists of a standardized automated guided vehicle (AGV) and the proven LBR iiwa lightweight robot. Mobility is provided by the KMR 200 CR mobile platform.\n\nIn January 2020, NACHI-FUJUKOSHI (Japan) launched the ultracompact robot model MZ01 designed to meet space-saving demands in the electric machinery, electronics, and EMS fields for applications that involve the handling of small component workpieces weighing around 100 g. MZ01 is ISO Class 5 certified and is suitable for clean room applications.\n\nOpportunity:\n\nThe air in a clean room is purified using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to achieve the required environmental conditions. Air is forced through the filters, which remove particles as small as 0.5 microns. The filtration system depends on the required level of cleanliness. Therefore, to maintain a clean room, space is required. As a result, companies try to optimize the use of space for clean room applications. As collaborative robots do not require cages around them and save space, they are preferred to traditional industrial robots. UR3, UR5, and UR10 are collaborative robots offered by Universal Robots (Denmark) for clean room applications and are ISO Class 5 certified. These robots are extensively being used in food, semiconductor, electrical, and optoelectronic industries. Therefore, the adoption of such collaborative robots for cleanroom applications is expected.\n\nChallenge:\n\nInteroperability is an important function in any factory or manufacturing unit. A modular framework is required for both hardware and software to connect and coordinate various automation systems. The focus here is on the software side, which is used for programming, diagnosing, and monitoring.\n\nCompanies often use robot arms from different manufacturers and may also need to reprogram robots due to a change in production and demand or to accommodate different parts, such as vision systems and end effectors. The integrator, rather than the manufacturer or application, is responsible for deciding the implementation and setup or programming of the robot. Interoperability issues present a big challenge, especially to SMEs, due to their unique requirements and lack of personnel to set up a complex automation setup.\n\nDividing the Global Clean Room Robot Market by Product Type and Application\n\nThis report segments the global Clean Room Robot Market on the basis of the following types :\n\nArticulated Robots\n\nSCARA Robots\n\nParallel Robots\n\nCartesian Robots\n\nCollaborative Robots\n\nOn the basis of application , the global market for Clean Room Robot is segmented into:\n\nAerospace\n\nElectrical and Electronics\n\nPlastics, Rubber, and Chemicals\n\nFood and Beverages\n\nPharmaceuticals and Cosmetics\n\nOthers\n\nREGIONAL ANALYSIS\n\nNorth America (US, Canada, Mexico)\n\nEurope (Germany, France, UK, Russia, Italy)\n\nAsia Pacific (China, Japan, South Korea, India, Southeast Asia)\n\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, etc.)\n\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, UAE), Egypt, Nigeria, and South Korea)\n\nFor more information about the report:\n\nhttps://www.marketinsightsreports.com/reports/120510913819/global-clean-room-robot-industry-research-report-growth-trends-and-competitive-analysis-2022-2028?Mode=Shruti24\n\nStrategic points covered in the Clean Room Robot market catalogue:\n\nIntroduction, market driving force product research goals and research scope Global Clean Room Robot market (2023-2029).\n\nExclusive Summary \u2013 Basic information on the global Clean Room Robot market.\n\nThe changing impact on market dynamics \u2013 global party supplies driving factors, trends, challenges and opportunities; post-COVID analysis.\n\nIntroduction Global Clean Room Robot market factors, after COVID impact analysis, Porter\u2019s five force, the supply / value chain, PESTEL analysis, market entropy, patent / trademark analysis.\n\nShow 2017-2023 by type, end user and region/country.\n\nAssess the leading manufacturers of the global Clean Room Robot market, including their competitive landscape, peer analysis, BCG matrix and company profile.\n\nEvaluate the market-by-market segments, countries/regions and manufacturers/companies, the revenue share and sales of these companies/companies in these different regions of the main countries/regions (2023-2029).\n\n\u2026 To be continued\n\nTable of Contents Clean Room Robot Market\n\nChapter 1: Clean Room Robot Market Overview, Drivers, Restrictions and Opportunities, Segmentation Overview\n\nChapter 2: Market competition by manufacturers\n\nChapter 3: Production by regions\n\nChapter 4: Consumption by Regions\n\nChapter 5: Production, by types, revenue and market share by types\n\nChapter 6: Consumption, by applications, market share (%) and growth rate by applications\n\nChapter 7: Profiling and comprehensive analysis of Producers\n\nChapter 8: Production Cost Analysis, Raw Material Analysis, Regional Production Expenses.\n\nChapter 9: Industrial chain, sourcing strategy and downstream buyers\n\nChapter 10: Marketing strategy analysis, distributors / merchants\n\nChapter 11: Market Effect Factors Analysis\n\nChapter 12: Market Forecasts\n\nChapter 13: Clean Room Robot Market Research findings and conclusions, Appendix, methodology and data source.\n\nKeep it going\u2026\n\nFinally, the researchers shed information on global Clean Room Robot \u2018 precise analysis.

            "text": "Since its founding in 1998, Vecna Technologies has developed a number of ways to help hospitals care for patients. The company has produced intake systems to respond to Covid-19 patient surges, prediction systems to manage health complications in maternity wards, and telepresence robots that have allowed sick people to stay connected with friends and loved ones.\n\nThe differences among those products have also led to a number of transformations and spinoffs, including material handling company Vecna Robotics and the health care nonprofit VecnaCares. Vecna Technologies co-founders Deborah Noel Theobald \u201995 and Daniel Theobald \u201995, SM \u201998 say each of those pivots has been driven by a desire to build a robotics company that makes a positive impact on the world.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to do robotics and do something good in the world,\u201d Deborah says of the team\u2019s mindset. \u201cWe founded Vecna thinking, \u2018How can these new web technologies influence and improve health care?\u2019 That\u2019s the arc MIT set me on and something I\u2019ve been excited to pursue ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fun ride\u201d\n\nAs a child, Deborah Theobald wanted to be an astronaut. The desire led her to MIT, which had one of the few aerospace engineering programs for undergraduates. She got interested in the health care industry while studying the health effects of long-term space exploration with Professor Dava Newman, the Apollo Program Professor of Astronautics at MIT who is now also the director of the Media Lab.\n\nDeborah also met Daniel Theobald at MIT. Daniel had been building robots since he was a child and was majoring in mechanical engineering.\n\nThe two began thinking about starting a company, and Daniel even applied to the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition (then the $10K) with a rough idea for a robotics company.\n\nFor their master\u2019s degrees, Deborah went to the University of Maryland to continue studying health effects in space, while Daniel stayed at MIT, working on several robotics projects. When Daniel graduated in 1998, Vecna was born.\n\nFrom day one, the company had a policy of paying employees to spend 10 percent of their work week doing community service.\n\n\u201cWe found that our focus on giving back benefited the business in so many ways that it was absolutely, unambiguously the right thing to do,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cFor one, it was a self-filtering mechanism. People joined Vecna who believed in giving back and wanted to be part of something that was socially responsible. And we found those are also the people that make amazing employees.\u201d\n\nThe founders got their first big break with a government contract to build a health care portal that allowed patients, managers, and providers to communicate and share documents. The contract also provided flexibility for the founders to explore other avenues for the business.\n\nThe pair went on to earn a number of government grants for one-off projects, some of which blossomed into successful commercial products. Another grant tasked them with building models to help hospitals predict and manage hospital acquired infections (HAIs), which kill tens of thousands of people in the U.S. each year. The resulting tool ended up being deployed in about 100 hospitals.\n\n\u201cAt the time, people were using spreadsheets to pull in data from different systems \u2026 and trying to comprehend what kind of infection it was,\u201d Deborah says, noting that doctors usually start infected patients on general antibiotics before they can classify the disease. \u201cOur tool allowed them to pull that information together faster, reducing their stay in hospitals \u2014 and all the trauma and pain that goes with that \u2014 by weeks.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s next product was a patient registration system that used kiosks to streamline patient intake at hospitals. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Vecna turned the platform into a text-based check-in service for clinics. The service is being used by thousands of hospitals today.\n\nSubsequent mobile versions of that system have been used to deliver medication, allow doctors to hold virtual consultations, and even help immunocompromised students to attend school virtually and avoid isolation.\n\nVecna\u2019s emphasis on community service led the team to explore ways to apply the company\u2019s technologies in low-resource settings, leading to the creation of the company\u2019s nonprofit arm, VecnaCares.\n\nIn 2014, VecnaCares brought their VGo mobile robot to Liberia and Sierra Leone to help with the Ebola response, allowing doctors to see patients without going through a time-consuming decontamination process. The company\u2019s patient intake software was also used to register and manage patients with Ebola and other diseases.\n\nVecnaCares has since partnered with groups including the International Rescue Committee, the International Committee of the Red Cross, International Medical Corp, and the Special Olympics for a variety of projects. It\u2019s also honed its algorithms to help low-resource hospitals manage staff shortages in maternity wards, helping nurses focus their attention on the babies and mothers most at risk of complications.\n\n\u201cOne of the places we\u2019re deployed has 10,000 births a year, so at any one time there may be 40 women laboring in that hospital, which has one operating room for all C-sections,\u201d Deborah explains. \u201cOur tool can intake women, do an assessment, and notify clinicians if someone\u2019s high risk and needs checking-in on. It leads to better outcomes and helps manage some of the complications that have led to a high rate of infant and maternal mortality in these areas.\u201d\n\nAfter years of robot development and commercialization, the founders decided their robots may be better suited for warehouses than health care. In 2017, Daniel spun out Vecna Robotics to focus exclusively on robotics for industrial settings like manufacturing, logistics, and order fulfillment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sort of done four different growths and exits,\u201d Deborah explains. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fun ride.\u201d\n\nContinuing to innovate\n\nAs it nears the 25th anniversary of its founding, Vecna Technologies is far from finished. Its leaders believe the firm\u2019s products and expertise can play a significant role in the burgeoning home health care and extended care industries, helping patients stay out of hospitals while remaining safe.\n\n\u201cAs we look at the aging population, that burden of care is really going to fall on family members as well as [health care organizations],\u201d Deborah says. \u201cI\u2019d love to be able to provide better tools for them to care for loved ones, which is often unpaid and unrecognized.\u201d\n\nLater this year, the company will release an inexpensive home care robot that can move autonomously or by remote control to help care for people struggling with diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s. The robots will be part of Vecna\u2019s \u201cBe There Network\u201d that health care providers can use to provide care for large numbers of patients despite staff shortages.\n\n\u201cNow you can see and hear and feel like you\u2019re actually there to more seamlessly interact with the environment,\u201d Deborah says. \u201cWe see that as the wave of the future now that people have begun to embrace telepresence. There are so many uses for this robot. People keep coming up with more ideas as they catch the vision.\u201d\n\nNo matter what the future holds for Vecna \u2014 whose motto is \u201cBetter technology, better world\u201d \u2014 the founders say the company will continue exploring new applications where its technologies could make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.",

What are the exact targets of robotics research funding programs (R&D) officially driven by governments in Asia, Europe and America today? This has been researched by the International Federation of Robotics and published in the 2023 update paper of \u201cWorld Robotics R&D Programs\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 3rd version of World Robotics R&D Programs covers the latest funding developments including updates in 2022,\u201d says Prof. Dr. Jong-Oh Park, Vice-Chairman IFR Research Committee and member of the Executive Board.\n\nThe overview shows that the most advanced robotics countries in terms of annual installations of industrial robots \u2013 China, Japan, USA, South Korea, Germany \u2013 and the EU drive very different R&D strategies:\n\nRobotics R&D programs \u2013 officially driven by governments\n\nIn China, the \u201c14th Five-Year Plan\u201d for Robot Industry Development, released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in Beijing on 21st December 2021, focuses on promoting innovation. The goal is to make China a global leader for robot technology and industrial advancement. Robotics is included in 8 key industries for the next 5 years. In order to implement national science and technology innovation arrangements, the key special program \u201cIntelligent Robots\u201d was launched under the National Key R&D Plan on 23rd April 2022 with a funding of 43.5 million USD. The recent statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR shows that China reached a robot density of 322 units per 10,000 workers in the manufacturing industry: The country ranks 5th worldwide in 2021 compared to 20th (140 units) in 2018.\n\nIn Japan, the \u201cNew Robot Strategy\u201d aims to make the country the world\u00b4s number one robot innovation hub. More than 930.5 million USD in support has been provided by the Japanese government in 2022. Key sectors are manufacturing (77.8 million USD), nursing and medical (55 million USD), infrastructure (643.2 million USD) and agriculture (66.2 million USD). The action plan for manufacturing and service includes projects such as autonomous driving, advanced air mobility or the development of integrated technologies that will be the core of next-generation artificial intelligence and robots. A budget of 440 million USD was allocated to robotics-related projects in the \u201cMoonshot Research and Development Program\u201d over a period of 5 years from 2020 to 2025. According to the statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR, Japan is the world\u00b4s number one industrial robot manufacturer and delivered 45% of the global supply in 2021.\n\nThe 3rd Basic Plan on Intelligent Robots of South Korea is pushing to develop robotics as a core industry in the fourth industrial revolution. The Korean government allocated 172.2 million USD in funding for the \u201c2022 Implementation Plan for the Intelligent Robot\u201d. From 2022 to 2024 a total of 7.41 million USD is planned in funding for the \u201cFull-Scale Test Platform Project for Special-Purpose Manned or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\u201d. The statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d showed an all-time high of 1,000 industrial robots per 10,000 employees in 2021. This makes Korea the country with the highest robot density worldwide.\n\nHorizon Europe is the European Union\u2019s key research and innovation framework program with a budget of 94.30 billion USD for seven years (2021-2027). Top targets are: strengthening the EU\u2019s scientific and technological bases, boosting Europe\u2019s innovation capacity, competitiveness and jobs as well as delivering on citizens\u2019 priorities and sustaining socio-economic models and values. The European Commission provides total funding of 198.5 million USD for the robotics-related work program 2021-2022.\n\nGermany\u00b4s High-Tech Strategy 2025 (HTS) is the fourth edition of the German R&D and innovation program. The German government will provide around 69 million USD annually until 2026 \u2013 a total budget of 345 million USD for five years. As part of the HTS 2025 mission, the program \u201cShaping technology for the people\u201d was launched. This program aims to use technological change in society as a whole and in the world of work for the benefit of people. Research topics are: digital assistance systems such as data glasses, human-robot-collaboration, exoskeletons to support employees in their physical work, but also solutions for the more flexible organization of work processes or the support of mobile work. According to the report \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR, Germany is the largest robot market in Europe \u2013 the robot density ranks in 4th place worldwide with 397 units per 10,000 employees.\n\nThe National Robotics Initiative (NRI) in the USA was launched for fundamental robotics R&D supported by the US government. The NRI-3.0 program, announced in February 2021, seeks research on integrated robot systems and builds upon the previous NRI programs. The US government supported the NRI-3.0 fund to the sum of 14 million USD in 2021. Collaboration among academics, industry, government, non-profit, and other organizations is encouraged. The \u201cMoon to Mars\u201d project by NASA for example highlights objectives to establish a long-term presence in the vicinity of and on the moon. The projects target research and technology development that will significantly increase the performance of robots to collaboratively support deep space human exploration and science missions. For the Artemis lunar program, the US government is planning to allocate a budget of 35 billion USD from 2020 to 2024. The statistical yearbook \u201cWorld Robotics\u201d by IFR shows that robot density in the United States rose from 255 units in 2020 to 274 units in 2021. The country ranks 9th in the world. Regarding annual installations of industrial robots, the USA takes 3rd position.\n\nInternational Federation of Robotics (IFR) connects the world of robotics around the globe. We aim at promoting the positive benefits of robots for productivity, competitiveness, economic growth and quality of work and life.",

            "text": "Olivier Toupet started his career working on autonomous helicopters.\n\nThe former supervisor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab now works at AV startup Zoox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Olivier Toupet, 42, a principal software engineer working within the planning and controls team at Zoox, the autonomous-vehicle startup owned by Amazon. Toupet is based in San Diego County, California. He started his career as an aerospace engineer and has an M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT and a M.S. in aeronautical engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO in France. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFrance is where I grew up and went to school for aerospace engineering.\n\nMy original passion is really in aeronautics and airplanes. I got my private pilot license. That school was a top space school in France, and has partnerships with top schools in the US, so I decided to do a double diploma at MIT.\n\nI've always been very interested in the US. I came during high school for a full month to a school in Philadelphia. I was excited to come again, this time for graduate school.\n\nI was lucky enough to find a French professor doing research on aerobatic helicopters.\n\nThat was in the early 2000s. Those were small-scale helicopters that were fully autonomous and flying the sky, doing the craziest aerobatics. Very interesting from a trajectory planning and control perspective.\n\nI've always loved mathematics and I've been pretty good at it. That's how I got into controls, motion planning, drones, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a foreigner, it's hard to work in the aerospace industry.\n\nThere are lots of restrictions. But I was lucky enough that my advisor had a small startup where he was actually commercializing some of his helicopters. The co-CEO was also an MIT research engineer. I got hired by a company, Aurora Flight Sciences, in November 2006.\n\nThe first six years of my career, I was working directly with a lot of faculty at MIT and doing really exciting research projects on multi-vehicle autonomy, so drones, ground vehicles, water vehicles, even space with NASA.\n\nAs you can imagine, very exciting intellectually, but sometimes it's a lot of small projects where you do small prototype developments, feasibility, and it doesn't really make it to an actual product.\n\nIt left me a little bit wanting in terms of having a bigger impact and actually developing real products.\n\nI moved to California right after I got married in 2011 and worked on self-flying cars at a company that's now called Wisk.Aero.\n\nI got to work on some pretty challenging problems. This was actually developing a real airplane from the ground up. So that was a little bit of a dream, a bunch of friends in a startup developing an aircraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlivier Toupet\n\nIt's a small world in robotics. I've never actually applied to a company. Of all the jobs that I've had to date, it's been friends reaching out to me to come work with them at that company.\n\nIn 2011, it was still a little bit early for self-flying cars. I think now they're starting to gain more momentum, but still probably a decade off.\n\nAnother friend of mine reached out and told me I should come join them. I decided to move to LA and go work at NASA. I figured after all the startups, why not work for a big company, and what better big company than NASA?\n\nI'm really interested by space and aerospace engineering, but my real passion was more airplanes.\n\nI was the supervisor of the Robotic Aerial Mobility group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nIt is kind of a unique place in the sense that it's called a FFRDC: Federally Funded Research and Development Center. It's at the intersection of industry and academia in the sense that you have some really cool research projects, but you also have really cool NASA flight missions, where you can actually infuse some of those robotics technologies.\n\nFor example, I developed the self-driving for the Perseverance rover, so now it can drive itself, on Mars, beyond the horizon. I got a medal from NASA for my work on traction control for the Curiosity rover, which helped basically reduce damage on the wheels. (Toupet received another NASA medal for software for the Perseverance rover.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got to drive the Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance rovers, as well as fly the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars.\n\nZoox\n\nI had a good friend who left JPL to go work at Zoox.\n\nI joined Zoox as a consultant in March 2015, and that was kind of ideal for me because I got to do cool stuff for NASA at a fairly slow pace \u2014 those space programs take many years to get to maturity \u2014 but at the same time, most weekends, I would be here in the Bay Area working at a much faster pace. It was kind of best of both worlds, and so that went on for seven years.\n\nZoox was acquired by Amazon. It was perfect timing.\n\nOne reason why it worked so well for me to be a consultant here: When you think about it, somebody may see it as just a few hours on weekends and so on. How can you be productive? The reason why it works so well is because there's a lot of technical expertise that I can leverage and that helps me develop things much more quickly than someone who would have to rediscover how to do things from scratch.\n\nI joined full-time in November 2021.\n\nZoox\n\nConnections are very important.\n\nIt's just all those strange coincidences in my life that ended up panning out. I don't know if I did anything special, except just following what I'm really excited about. To me, what's most important is the people with whom you work. If you look at my career, even though I really like airplanes, then I went to space and I went to AV, and it's not necessarily because I was that excited about AV or space, it is also because of the people I got to work with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are other AV companies, but I would never consider working for another one, because to me, the people at Zoox, they are like family.\n\nThe leaders of the company, CTO (Jesse Levinson) and CEO (Aicha Evans), are people that I look up to and that I admire. They're not just people who pay me every month.\n\nZoox\n\nThe AV space is the next frontier of robotics.\n\nI've worked on lots of autonomous vehicles, but always in some fairly small scope. What we're trying to do here in the AV space, it's extremely multidisciplinary. It's the entire robotics stack. You're doing perception, you're doing planning, you're doing prediction, doing simulation. Zoox is also doing the vehicle as well, so all the hardware. It's redesigning the whole robotaxi from scratch.\n\nIf we are able to develop that technology that can react faster than humans and doesn't get drunk and doesn't get tired and doesn't get sleepy at the wheel, that's a fantastic outcome of the robotics expertise I've developed.\n\nThe gain is proportional to the risk you take. If you always try to do something easy, then your accomplishments are not as great. I do think that technology for self-driving cars has some challenges, but we will get there. It's a frontier that we will reach soon and I think it's absolutely worth the challenge and the hard work.",

            "text": "A planned strategic update for Australia\u2019s burgeoning space sector is in doubt with the new government yet to back the $9.5 million initiative announced nearly a year ago, adding to industry concerns about lost momentum.\n\nThe Albanese government won\u2019t commit to completing the Space Strategic Update (SSU) promised by the Coalition in March last year because it is still considering its alignment with its own investment, technology and defence policies.\n\nOriginally planned to take 18 months to two years to develop by the Australian Space Agency, the SSU was to provide a \u201cvision\u201d for the sector through to the 2040s that united civil and defence space efforts with a more cohesive strategy.\n\nA space policy expert says while little detail has emerged since March, dropping the initiative would be a lost opportunity for the Albanese government and add to concerns in the sector it is being overlooked.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that the Albanese government gets this done,\u201d Australian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst Dr Malcolm Davis told InnovationAus.com.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t, then it really will undermine confidence within Australia and beyond about our country\u2019s space [sector] and you will see knock on effects from that that would I think be really counterproductive for us achieving some of the goals that we set out to achieve when the Space Agency was first opened in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Space Agency released a 10-year plan for the civil sector in 2019, aiming to triple the size of the civil space sector to $12bn. The Department of Defence launched Australia\u2019s Defence Space Strategy last year.\n\nIn March, then-minister for Science and Technology Melissa Price said the SSU would help unite the civil and Defence space sectors with better coordination of investments to develop a space sector that delivers both civil and defence capabilities.\n\nThe SSU was budgeted $9.5 million over two years from 2021/22 in the Coalition\u2019s March budget. But the initiative does not appear in the Albanese government\u2019s October budget and officials told an Senate Estimates hearing in November that the initiative and any of its uncommitted funding remains under consideration.\n\nA spokesperson for Industry minister Ed Husic has confirmed the initiative is far from locked in.\n\n\u201cThe Space Strategic Update was an initiative of the previous government,\u201d the spokesperson told InnovationAus.com\n\n\u201cThe Albanese Labor government will consider long term national space priorities in the context of our broader agenda. This will take into account government priorities including the National Reconstruction Fund, critical technology development \u2013 such as robotics, quantum computing and artificial intelligence \u2013 and the Defence Strategic Review being led by Deputy Prime Minister Marles.\u201d\n\nThe Industry department and Australian Space Agency, which had been set to begin work on the SSU in July before the change of government, declined to provide any indication on how much investment had been made in the SSU or if there was still a planned release.\n\nInstead, a spokesperson for the Australian Space Agency said it had been consulting with the space industry throughout the last year, with feedback leading to new products and better collaboration with states and territories.\n\nDr Davis said more information and a decision one way or another on the SSU is needed for the Australian space sector.\n\n\u201cIt is rather frustrating for those of us in the space policy sector to be kind of being kept out of the loop and in the dark on this very important document,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the case that the Albanese government is going to do a go slow on this and hold off maybe until after the next federal budget, then that\u2019s a bit frustrating too.\u201d\n\nParts of the Australian sector are frustrated by what is being perceived as a lack of commitment from the new government, Dr Davis said.\n\nThe Space Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) launched a broadside at the new government in September last year, questioning the Albanese government\u2019s commitment to the area and the placement of space within the Industry portfolio rather than Home Affairs or Prime Minister and Cabinet.\n\nBut the industry group has landed several meetings with the Australian Space Agency, the Industry department, and Minister, while individual space businesses have also met with the new government nearly 200 times since it was sworn in.\n\nFunding for space grant programs was also spared in the Albanese government\u2019s spending audit, although how it is distributed may also change.\n\nAn official government response was also provided to a parliamentary inquiry into the local space industry and its 38 recommendations. But there was little commitment to concrete changes and the response also suggested a wait for other policies.\n\nWith worsening economic conditions and an unstable geopolitical environment greeting the new government, some caution is understandable, Dr Davis says. But the clock is ticking for the Australian space sector and the SSU would be useful, he said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to leave it too long because if they leave it too long then suddenly you got to lose momentum. Companies and organisations are going to start losing confidence and that\u2019s when you get companies closing down and going overseas. Jobs are lost and it\u2019s just snowballs from there. \u201c\n\nDo you know more? Contact James Riley via Email.",

            "text": "\u00a9 Provided by Business Insider Olivier Toupet, principal software engineer at Zoox, started his career as an aerospace engineer. Olivier Toupet\n\nOlivier Toupet started his career working on autonomous helicopters.\n\nThe former supervisor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab now works at AV startup Zoox.\n\nHere's his story, as told to the reporter Alexa St. John.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Olivier Toupet, 42, a principal software engineer working within the planning and controls team at Zoox, the autonomous-vehicle startup owned by Amazon. Toupet is based in San Diego County, California. He started his career as an aerospace engineer and has an M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT and a M.S. in aeronautical engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO in France. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFrance is where I grew up and went to school for aerospace engineering.\n\nMy original passion is really in aeronautics and airplanes. I got my private pilot license. That school was a top space school in France, and has partnerships with top schools in the US, so I decided to do a double diploma at MIT.\n\nI've always been very interested in the US. I came during high school for a full month to a school in Philadelphia. I was excited to come again, this time for graduate school.\n\nI was lucky enough to find a French professor doing research on aerobatic helicopters.\n\nThat was in the early 2000s. Those were small-scale helicopters that were fully autonomous and flying the sky, doing the craziest aerobatics. Very interesting from a trajectory planning and control perspective.\n\nI've always loved mathematics and I've been pretty good at it. That's how I got into controls, motion planning, drones, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAs a foreigner, it's hard to work in the aerospace industry.\n\nThere are lots of restrictions. But I was lucky enough that my advisor had a small startup where he was actually commercializing some of his helicopters. The co-CEO was also an MIT research engineer. I got hired by a company, Aurora Flight Sciences, in November 2006.\n\nThe first six years of my career, I was working directly with a lot of faculty at MIT and doing really exciting research projects on multi-vehicle autonomy, so drones, ground vehicles, water vehicles, even space with NASA.\n\nAs you can imagine, very exciting intellectually, but sometimes it's a lot of small projects where you do small prototype developments, feasibility, and it doesn't really make it to an actual product.\n\nIt left me a little bit wanting in terms of having a bigger impact and actually developing real products.\n\nI moved to California right after I got married in 2011 and worked on self-flying cars at a company that's now called Wisk.Aero.\n\nI got to work on some pretty challenging problems. This was actually developing a real airplane from the ground up. So that was a little bit of a dream, a bunch of friends in a startup developing an aircraft.\n\n\u00a9 Olivier Toupet Toupet spent time as supervisor of the Robotic Aerial Mobility group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Olivier Toupet\n\nIt's a small world in robotics. I've never actually applied to a company. Of all the jobs that I've had to date, it's been friends reaching out to me to come work with them at that company.\n\nIn 2011, it was still a little bit early for self-flying cars. I think now they're starting to gain more momentum, but still probably a decade off.\n\nAnother friend of mine reached out and told me I should come join them. I decided to move to LA and go work at NASA. I figured after all the startups, why not work for a big company, and what better big company than NASA?\n\nI'm really interested by space and aerospace engineering, but my real passion was more airplanes.\n\nI was the supervisor of the Robotic Aerial Mobility group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nIt is kind of a unique place in the sense that it's called a FFRDC: Federally Funded Research and Development Center. It's at the intersection of industry and academia in the sense that you have some really cool research projects, but you also have really cool NASA flight missions, where you can actually infuse some of those robotics technologies.\n\nFor example, I developed the self-driving for the Perseverance rover, so now it can drive itself, on Mars, beyond the horizon. I got a medal from NASA for my work on traction control for the Curiosity rover, which helped basically reduce damage on the wheels. (Toupet received another NASA medal for software for the Perseverance rover.)\n\nI got to drive the Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance rovers, as well as fly the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars.\n\n\u00a9 Zoox Toupet joined the early team of Zoox as a consultant in March 2015. Zoox\n\nI had a good friend who left JPL to go work at Zoox.\n\nI joined Zoox as a consultant in March 2015, and that was kind of ideal for me because I got to do cool stuff for NASA at a fairly slow pace \u2014 those space programs take many years to get to maturity \u2014 but at the same time, most weekends, I would be here in the Bay Area working at a much faster pace. It was kind of best of both worlds, and so that went on for seven years.\n\nZoox was acquired by Amazon. It was perfect timing.\n\nOne reason why it worked so well for me to be a consultant here: When you think about it, somebody may see it as just a few hours on weekends and so on. How can you be productive? The reason why it works so well is because there's a lot of technical expertise that I can leverage and that helps me develop things much more quickly than someone who would have to rediscover how to do things from scratch.\n\nI joined full-time in November 2021.\n\n\u00a9 Zoox Toupet joined Zoox full-time in 2021. Zoox\n\nConnections are very important.\n\nIt's just all those strange coincidences in my life that ended up panning out. I don't know if I did anything special, except just following what I'm really excited about. To me, what's most important is the people with whom you work. If you look at my career, even though I really like airplanes, then I went to space and I went to AV, and it's not necessarily because I was that excited about AV or space, it is also because of the people I got to work with.\n\nThere are other AV companies, but I would never consider working for another one, because to me, the people at Zoox, they are like family.\n\nThe leaders of the company, CTO (Jesse Levinson) and CEO (Aicha Evans), are people that I look up to and that I admire. They're not just people who pay me every month.\n\n\u00a9 Zoox Toupet says autonomous vehicle tech like Zoox's is next frontier of robotics. Zoox\n\nThe AV space is the next frontier of robotics.\n\nI've worked on lots of autonomous vehicles, but always in some fairly small scope.

            "text": "NASA's Perseverance Mars rover took this selfie on September 10, 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nHumans have sent many robotic vehicles to study Mars, nearly 34 million miles away from Earth.\n\nSix-wheeled rovers have a twin set of cameras that act like eyes and a mast that looks like a neck.\n\nThe robots take on \"personalities\" through their experiences and first-person social media accounts.\n\nWhen a Mars rover beams back a selfie, the mission's Earth-bound engineers and scientists feel like they're getting a FaceTime from a friend they haven't seen in ages.\n\nWe know Mars rovers are robots, but they feel like friends, or pets. What makes us feel so attached to them?\n\nThose who work closely with these robotic emissaries \u2014 as well as the public \u2014 tend to anthropomorphize them, or endow these inanimate robots with human qualities, and experts told Insider this can help the overall mission.\n\n\"In all NASA missions, people feel some sense of connection to the vehicle, whether that's a rover, an orbiter, or a lander,\" Janet Vertesi, a sociologist of science and technology at Princeton University and ethnographer in several of NASA's robotic space missions, told Insider.\n\n\"The robot is the thing that brings a whole community together \u2014 it's like a symbol for the group.\"\n\nWe're hardwired to respond emotionally to cute robotic faces\n\nEven scientists and engineers can't help but attribute human characteristics to space robots.\n\n\"It's the way the rovers are designed,\" Abigail Freeman, the deputy project scientist of the Curiosity rover, told Insider. \"Our brain is wired to make faces out of things that only vaguely resemble faces.\"\n\nThe first selfie NASA's Opportunity Mars rover snapped. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nTake the golf-cart-sized twin rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on the red planet in 2004.\n\nBoth rovers measure just over five feet tall and exceeded their expected lifetimes of 90 days exploring and gathering data on the Mars' surface.\n\nLike most modern rovers, the twins have a camera mast that looks like a neck.\n\n\"It really looks like a face, and that's on purpose from a scientific perspective,\" Freeman said. \"We have two cameras that are spaced about the same space as the eyes.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRovers also have robotic arms designed to work as a human geologist would.\n\n\"We're living vicariously through through these robotic explorers,\" Emily Stough, an engineer for NASA's Insight lander, told Insider. \"It's kind of like friends go on a great adventure and they take all these great pictures and you get to follow along from home.\"\n\nTheir ability to snap selfies on the Martian surface make them seem self-aware\n\nNASA's Curiosity Mars rover created this selfie in front of Mont Mercou. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nRovers are able to use the camera attached to their robotic arm to take epic selfies from the Martian surface.\n\n\"There's a certain self-awareness behind taking a selfie, and I think we can translate this to the rover,\" Katie Stack Morgan, deputy project scientist of the Mars 2020 rover, told Insider.\n\n\"Of course, we're the ones telling it to do that.\"\n\nPerseverance rotates its robotic arm. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\n\"What always struck me about the selfies is that like, how just a subtle tilt of the mast can kind of convey a different human emotion compared to a head-on, straight-on view,\" she added.\n\nRobot 'personalities' emerge by tackling challenges on Mars\n\nAs a mission with a six-wheeled rover ages, the robot's \"personality\" emerges.\n\nSpirit and Opportunity were two rovers that were totally identical in their design. But based on the different places where the rovers landed on Mars, they ended up having two very different experiences.\n\n\"Spirit got this personality where it was sort of a blue-collar worker, really down in the dirt grinding away. It needed to do a lot harder work,\" Freeman said.\n\nOpportunity, meanwhile, was known as \"Little Miss Perfect\" after it landed on top of geological evidence of liquid water.\n\nFull-scale models of three generations of Mars rovers, with Sojourner rover (center), the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers (left), and Curiosity (right) NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThen there's Curiosity, a car-sized rover that landed on Mars in 2012. Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lovingly started calling it George, according to Stack Morgan, who also served as a geologist for the Curiosity rover mission.\n\nThe resilient robot has had to overcome several issues throughout its mission.\n\n\"You get this feeling that the rover is tackling challenges, and those become very human actions,\" Stack Morgan said. \"Through the ups and downs of operating a spacecraft is when you really start to build that emotional connection \u2014 you really start to see them as a friend and partner who's struggling along with you. We're doing the Earth side of it and the rovers are doing the Mars side of it.\"\n\nNot all mission team members embrace this level of attributing human characteristics to a literal robot.\n\n\"For some people, the anthropomorphizing is going too far, because it would take away from the pressure to really care for the robot,\" Vertosi, the sociologist, said.\n\nThe public can engage with first-person accounts on social media\n\n\"Scientists do have a way of interacting with the rovers that really brings them to life. But it's not quite the same as the public,\" Vertesi said. \"NASA has really encouraged that because, you know, public engagement is incredibly important for publicly funded science. I think that's why we see so much of this encouragement of anthropomorphism among the public.\"\n\nThis started with LiveJournal entries for Spirit and Opportunity, ascribing them each their own personalities. Now, most NASA missions now have their own social media accounts written in the first-person.\n\nRovers, landers, and orbiters can even send heartbreaking farewell messages, thanks to their dedicated social media team.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

            "text": "Since its founding in 2002, SpaceX has become a significant player in space exploration, and its stock is an attractive option for investors. With the potential for lucrative returns, it\u2019s no wonder that people are asking, \u201cIs SpaceX stock a good investment?\u201d.\n\nSpaceX is a private aerospace manufacturer based in Hawthorne, California. It designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002. Musk serves as CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX has four main lines of business: Space Exploration, Satellite Communications, Research and Development, and Build-Operate-Transfer.\n\nThe company\u2019s first two lines of business are related to the exploration and production of space. The third line of business includes satellite technology research and development projects. The fourth line of business includes building and launching commercial satellites for other companies. Although SpaceX was initially focused on building rockets for government contracts, the company now conducts most of its business in the private sector.\n\nAs of May 31, 2019, SpaceX has a market cap of $33.5 billion and over $21 billion in annual revenue. Its main competitors include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin.\n\nIn this article, we will analyze the pros and cons of investing in SpaceX stock to determine if it\u2019s possible to buy it in 2023.\n\nCan you buy SpaceX stock?\n\nHave you ever dreamed of owning a piece of SpaceX? Well, unfortunately, that\u2019s not possible yet. SpaceX is a private company, meaning its shares are not publicly available and not listed in the Stock Market.\n\nThis means that you can\u2019t buy stock in SpaceX, as the company is not public, and there hasn\u2019t been an Initial Public Offering (IPO) announced yet. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be a part of SpaceX\u2019s success. Even though you can\u2019t own stock of the company, there are still ways you can join the space revolution.\n\nVirgin Galactic, Momentus, Rocket Lab USA, and Boeing are all companies involved in the space industry. These companies have a strong track record and are expected to be profitable. They could be good investment options for investors in the space industry.\n\nSpaceX technology as an investment\n\nSpaceX technology is often associated with government funding and high-profile projects like the Apollo program. While these ventures are essential, they do not provide profit to investors. SpaceX, however, is a private company that generates profit from commercial contracts.\n\nTherefore, investing in space technology is a more reliable way to make money than putting money towards government projects. Investing in space technology is an intelligent choice if you want to make a profit. Another advantage of investing in space technology is that it is an up-and-coming industry.\n\nThe space industry is expected to grow as more people use satellites for communication, weather prediction, and navigation. As this industry expands, space technology demand will increase, leading to higher profits for investors. Overall, investing in SpaceX stock is impossible as the company is still private.\n\nElon Musk and SpaceX\n\nElon Musk is the founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. In other words, he is the man behind two of the world\u2019s most successful and innovative companies. His experience in the tech and automotive industries makes him a powerful leader for both companies.\n\nThis means that he will likely continue to make good decisions for Space X, which will benefit investors. Musk has a lot on his plate as the CEO of two major companies.\n\nNevertheless, he closely monitors both companies, ensuring they remain competitive in their respective markets. This demonstrates his commitment to SpaceX and his ability to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nAs a result, SpaceX continues to grow and prosper while Musk continues to lead the company toward greater heights.\n\nSpaceX Products\n\nSpaceX has a variety of products to offer customers. These products range from satellites to spacecraft. The company also offers launch services, which allow customers to send payloads into space. SpaceX also manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which launch payloads into orbit.\n\nAdditionally, the company is working on developing a reusable rocket system to reduce space travel costs. This system is expected to revolutionize the industry and make space exploration more affordable. Finally, SpaceX is developing a satellite-based internet service to provide global internet access. This service is expected to be available shortly and will be a breakthrough for the industry.\n\nOverall, SpaceX is an innovative company that has revolutionized the space industry. The company offers a variety of products and services that are beneficial to customers and investors alike.\n\nThe company manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft for commercial and government customers. SpaceX also offers satellite services, including satellite design, building, and operation for customers. The company\u2019s flagship launch vehicle is the Falcon 9, which can launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) and Dragon capsules into orbit around Earth.\n\nThe company also manufactures and launches the Falcon Heavy, which is expected to become the most powerful operational rocket in the world once it begins commercial operations. The company also manufactures and launches the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) spaceship, which SpaceX expects to be the first reusable and crewed spaceship in history.\n\nSpace industry 2023\n\nThe space industry is expected to expand as the world becomes more reliant on satellites. By 2023, the global space industry is expected to reach $1.5 trillion in revenue. This growth will be driven by increased demand for satellite services, such as communication, navigation, and weather prediction.\n\nAdditionally, developing reusable rockets and spacecraft will reduce costs associated with space exploration and make it more accessible to companies and individuals. As a result, more people will be able to explore space, leading to further industry growth.\n\nFurthermore, developing new technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics will enable companies to explore space more efficiently and effectively. This will create even more opportunities for investors in the space industry.\n\nThis growth will likely be driven by an increase in new commercial customers and a shift in demand from government contracts to commercial contracts. The growing need to improve connectivity and provide worldwide internet access will drive demand for more satellites.\n\nIn addition, the need to monitor and manage natural resources and environments will drive demand for more satellite data. As a result, the space industry is expected to grow from $304 billion in 2018 to about $420 billion in 2023.\n\nSpaceX is well-positioned to take advantage of this growth in the space industry.
