            "text": "Rick Spielman knows the Chicago Bears organization well. He worked with them extensively as a scout and executive in the 1990s. Then he went against them for years as the GM of the Minnesota Vikings. He was familiar with how they operated and what they\u2019re trying to build under new GM Ryan Poles and head coach Matt Eberflus. During an interview with Football Night in Chicago, Spielman made a few things clear. He reiterated the Bears should stick with Justin Fields. Don\u2019t even consider trading him in favor of these 2023 draft quarterbacks. His ceiling is far higher than any of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Spielman, the decision on what to do with the #1 overall pick is straightforward. If it were him, he\u2019d trade down. The Bears\u2019 roster needs a ton of work. That can be helped with the many additional picks they\u2019d get by moving down with a quarterback-needy team. However, Spielman believes the answer isn\u2019t complicated if forced to make the pick. It should be Jalen Carter. There are two reasons. One is because true three-technique interior pass rushers are hard to find. Carter has the skillset ideally suited for it. The other is this draft class is deep in edge rushers, so the pressure to take somebody like Will Anderson isn\u2019t too high.\n\nRyan Poles\u2019 background also leans into this prediction.\n\nHe, too, understands the value of a dominant interior rusher. Look at what Chris Jones has done for the Kansas City Chiefs since arriving years ago. His presence has been almost as crucial to their dominance of the AFC as the arrival of Patrick Mahomes. Cincinnati had no answers for him in the conference championship game. Eberflus knows this too. He saw DeForest Buckner drive his defenses in Indianapolis for two years. Unless Carter\u2019s personality turns them off during interviews, it would be a shock if they don\u2019t see him as a perfect addition to their defense.\n\nOf course, trading down would likely force them to change their plans. It feels unlikely Carter gets out of the top three. Arizona at #3 feels like an obvious spot for him to land. If Ryan Poles decides to drop outside the top five in a trade, he may start looking at edge rushers like Tyree Wilson or an offensive tackle like Paris Johnson. His belief in such players will determine whether or not he is willing to pass on a talent like Carter.",

Then, of course, the Bears moved up one in a trade to draft Mitchell Trubisky and Mahomes fell to 10th before Kansas City traded up and took him.\n\n\"We thought he was going to be the third pick overall and go to Chicago,\" Patrick Mahomes Sr. said. \"He had a great meeting when he went there and liked all the guys that were doing the stuff there and thought he was going to be a Bear.\n\n\"Then once they traded up and got Mitch, it kind of hurt him. It really did. He always knew that Kansas City had told him that they were going to come up and get him. They just didn\u2019t know how far they\u2019d have to go. But initially, he thought he was going to be a Chicago Bear.\u201d\n\nPATRICK MAHOMES SR. TELLS WSCR HIS SON EXPECTED TO BE A BEAR\n\nIt probably doesn't say much for Patrick Jr. when his father said he \"liked all the guys that were doing the stuff there,\" in Chicago, because it means he had a good opinion of John Fox, Pace and offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains.\n\nAt least Pace had someone convinced they were drafting third and taking Mahomes. Pace sure didn't have John Lynch convinced, and the 49ers GM played it to the hilt by soaking him for two third-rounders and a fourth-rounder to move up one spot for Trubisky.\n\nOver a year after Poles is gone, and Matt Nagy is back in Kansas City going to a Super Bowl as Mahomes' position coach, Bears fans took to social media angered over something entirely irrelevant now because different people are running the show.\n\nAll of the complaints should be forwarded to Atlanta, where Pace now works.\n\nTwitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMaven",

            "text": "The success of Patrick Mahomes continues to torment Chicago Bears fans.\n\nAfter clinching his third trip to the Super Bowl in his fifth season as a starter, the Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback's father said he \u201cwholeheartedly thought\u201d he was going to be Chicago.\n\nAnd he added that Mahomes \u201cdefinitely wanted\u201d to be a Bear.\n\nPatrick Mahomes Sr. just told us the Bears told his son they'd be drafting him third overall.\n\n\n\nThey traded up and drafted Mitch Trubisky instead, if you don't remember. https://t.co/t7x173W5CI https://t.co/MC0wNIinfM \u2014 The Parkins & Spiegel Show (@ParkinsSpiegel) January 30, 2023\n\n\u201cBecause they told him that they were going to draft him,\" Mahomes Sr. told Parkins and Spiegel. \"They told him they were going to draft him, so we thought he was going to be the third pick overall and go to Chicago. He had a great meeting when he there and liked all the guys that were doing stuff there. He thought he was going to be a Bear.\n\n\"And then once they traded up and got Mitch, it kind of hurt him. It really did.\"\n\nThe Bears famously traded up in the draft to select North Carolina quarterback Mitchell Trubisky with the second-overall pick. The Chiefs would eventually move up to the No. 10 pick to select Mahomes.\n\nMahomes would go on to win the MVP in his first season as a starter and a Super Bowl in his second. He took the Chiefs back to the Super Bowl the following season and just won his third AFC Championship game in five seasons to go back to the Super Bowl.\n\nIn 2020, Bleacher Report's Kalyn Kahler reported the Bears told Mahomes they would select him.\n\nMahomes himself has shed some light on what he thought was going to happen in 2017, but it didn't involve the Bears. On the Kelce brothers' podcast, Mahomes outlines how he told the Chiefs if they wanted him they'd have to trade up to get him because he thought the New Orleans Saints were going to select him at No. 11.\n\n\"\u201cAs the process went on, I got a feeling I was going up in the draft,\" Mahomes said. \"I had a couple of teams that said they were gonna draft me \u2014 and I mean, that\u2019s true, it\u2019s not like these coaches are making it up \u2014 I talked to them in the draft process and they were like, \u2018Hey if you\u2019re there, we\u2019re gonna take you'\u201d\n\nNow one of those teams could've been the Bears, but Mahomes was giving warnings about being selected later than the Bears' pick to the Chiefs.\n\n\"I kind of gave a little inside info to the Chiefs: \u2018Hey, if y\u2019all let me go anywhere below, at the time I didn\u2019t know about the Saints, but if y\u2019all let me go 12 or below I\u2019m gonna get drafted by someone else,\u2019\" Mahomes said.\n\n\"So I gave the Chiefs a little bit of info on that because I wanted to be here.\u201d\n\nIt could be that Mahomes knew the Chiefs were a safety net of sorts.\n\n\"He always knew that Kansas City had told him that they were going to come up and get him,\" Mohomes Sr. said. \"They just didn\u2019t know how far they\u2019d have to go. But initially, he thought he was going to be a Chicago Bear.\u201d\n\nAnd the irony from that interview, Matt Nagy stacked the deck for the Chiefs to get Mahomes. Nagy gave Mahomes the plays they were going to go over in advance of his meeting with Andy Reid so he would ace the interview. Nagy would then be hired by the Bears as the head coach in 2018, after Mahomes' rookie season in Kansas City.\n\nPicking Trubisky, who is on his third team in his career, will always sting Chicago fans.\n\nWhen the Chiefs played the Bears in 2019, Mahomes added some salt in the wound of Bears fan with a touchdown celebration. He counted to the No. 10, because he was the 10th overall pick after the Bears passed in favor of Trubisky.\n\nFun fact: Patrick took his college number 5 and added 10 to it for his current number.\n\n\n\nWonder why \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0094 pic.twitter.com/reAFxsrFRa \u2014 Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) December 23, 2019\n\nThis August, the Chiefs came to Soldier Field and Mahomes expressed his love of playing in Chicago.\n\n\"I love playing here at Soldier Field,\" Mahomes said. \"It's an awesome stadium. You feel the history of it. And hopefully I get to play a couple more games here and and try to do whatever I can to win them.\"\n\nWhat could've been.\n\nIf you want to feel better, the Bears have a promising young quarterback now in Justin Fields. Hall of fame wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said he sees a little Mahomes in Fields.\n\n\"You know what he [Fields] has that I just picked up on?\" Johnson said Keyshawn, JWill and Max. \"Does he got a little Patrick Mahomes in him? I'm just talking about his ability to move around and throw the football.\"\n\nJohnson added: \"It just dawned on me right here on this play. Bam! He's out. Eyes down the field, he throws a ball to his left down the sideline. That's Patrick Mahomes.\"\n\nFields has another offseason to improve his game and hopefully general manager Ryan Poles, armed with an unrivaled war chest of cap space and the No. 1 overall draft pick, can bolster the team around him.\n\nBut what could've been.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "The Bears have been poised to have the most salary-cap space in the NFL. Now we know exactly how much.\n\nThe NFL told teams Monday that the 2023 salary cap is expected to be $224.8 million. That represents about an 8% bump from the $208.2 million cap in 2022 and makes official what the Bears have been anticipating for almost a year \u2014 that they\u2019ll have a lot of room to make signings this offseason.\n\nAccording to OvertheCap.com, the Bears will have $91.8 million in 2023 cap space. That figure laps the field. The Falcons rank second with $56.4 million, while the Giants are third with $44.7 million.\n\nThe Bears\u2019 shopping list is longer than those two teams\u2019, though. They have only 49 players counting against their salary cap, the eighth-fewest in the league.\n\nThe Bears are expected to be a major factor this offseason. They figure to spend their salary cap on free-agent additions \u2014 their major needs are on both lines, at linebacker and at wide receiver \u2014 starting March 15.\n\nThey\u2019ll likely sign some of their best players to extensions. Tight end Cole Kmet figures to get a new deal, as does cornerback Jaylon Johnson. The Bears also could -consider extensions for wide receivers Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool, though Mooney seems far more likely. All four are entering the final seasons of their four-year rookie contracts and just became eligible for extensions.\n\nThe Bears have the first pick in this year\u2019s draft. General manager Ryan Poles said he would have to be \u201cabsolutely blown away\u201d to move on from quarterback Justin Fields. Teams that do need a quarterback, however, are expected to contact the Bears about trading up to the No. 1 spot in the April draft.",

            "text": "The Senior Bowl begins this week, and the Chicago Bears are well-represented. Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy got the honor of coaching the American team. That means he will run everything from practices to meetings and the game itself next weekend. It marks the second time since 2017 the Bears have had this honor. They didn\u2019t really take advantage of the opportunity six years ago, only drafting one Senior Bowl participant in Jordan Morgan. Perhaps that might change this time around.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Minnesota Vikings GM Rick Spielman couldn\u2019t understate how big of an advantage the Bears will enjoy with Getsy running the show down there. He\u2019ll have access to these players that other teams can only dream of. He explained what it could do for a franchise\u2019s fortunes on Football Night in Chicago.\n\nHarrison Smith is a six-time Pro Bowler for the Vikings and one of the best safeties of the 2010s. A year later, another division rival proved his words correct. The Detroit Lions coached the South team in 2013. They made defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, who was on that roster, their 1st round pick. He was an All-Pro for them and played six solid seasons before injuries shortened his career.\n\nThe Chicago Bears can\u2019t let this opportunity pass again.\n\nThankfully they appear to have somebody in charge that takes the event seriously. Ryan Poles drafted four players who were at the 2022 Senior Bowl. He came from an organization in Kansas City that had considerable success targeting players who shined at the event. Eric Fisher went 1st overall in 2013 and made the Pro Bowl twice. Dee Ford dominated the event a year later and collected 30.5 sacks in five seasons with the team. There is plenty of proof to back up the idea of players that look great at the Senior Bowl carrying it into the NFL.\n\nThere will be no shortage of intriguing prospects for the Chicago Bears. Rashee Rice (WR), Darnell Wright (OT), Matthew Bergeron (OT), and O\u2019Cyrus Torrence are all considered top 50 players in this class. Getsy will be coaching all of them directly. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine the Bears targeting them in the early rounds if they make a big impression. That is why this week should be exciting for fans. Players they see shine in practices and the game may end up hearing their names called in April.",

This is their second time since 2017 and could be an advantage for them to draft players who shined at the event, such as Eric Fisher and Dee Ford from Kansas City. There will also be plenty of intriguing prospects for them to consider, including Rashee Rice (WR), Darnell Wright (OT), Matthew Bergeron (OT), and O\u2019Cyrus Torrence. Fans should keep an eye out on these players during practices and the game next weekend."

The former Bears head coach earned his ticket to the big game as the quarterbacks coach for the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIt felt like the Bears had legit Super Bowl aspirations in 2018, his first season leading the team. The defense played lights out all year, and they had a penchant for finding ways to win close games against good teams. But the Bears\u2019 postseason run ended before it really got going, when they sputtered against the Eagles in the Wild Card Round. Coincidentally, Nagy will get a second chance against the Eagles, since that will be the Chiefs opponent for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe farthest Nagy had ever made it in the postseason before was the NFC Championship game after the 2008 season when he was an intern on Andy Reid\u2019s Eagles staff. This is Nagy\u2019s second stint on the Chiefs coaching staff. Previously, he was the Chiefs offensive coordinator and earned credit for encouraging the team to draft Patrick Mahomes. It\u2019s unclear how much Nagy helped Mahomes develop into the phenomenal QB that he is today, but the two have certainly enjoyed success together.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is considered a front runner for the MVP award this year. He led the league with 5,250 passing yards, 41 touchdowns and a 6.3% touchdown rate. For his efforts he was named to the All-Pro First Team and to the Pro Bowl.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

However, that may be putting the carriage before the horse in this situation. While Payne is expected to be a free agent this offseason, we see this every year. An elite player is supposed to be a free agent and then a week or two before the start of free agency, things change and he is off the market. Will this be any different?\n\nWill Chicago Bears have a chance to sign Da\u2019Ron Payne?\n\nWashington will first get a chance to extend him. This could end up in the Bears\u2019 favor because Payne saw his price tag shoot up this season. His pass rush improved tremendously, and he will get a big pay at his age, draft status, and stat production.\n\nIn fact, there is speculation around Washington that he will not only get $20M per year, but will exceed that, and likely be closer to $21M or $22M. This could help Chicago because it could price him out of Washington.\n\nThis is notable because Jonathan Allen is already making $18M per year. Can Washington give Payne and Allen $40M combined, and can they give Payne much more than Allen? Both could hurt a long-term extension.\n\nChicago Bears must beware of the franchise tag for Da\u2019Ron Payne\n\nHowever, what Chicago Bears have to be afraid of is that Washington will franchise-tag Payne. A franchise tag for defensive tackles if $18.9M. Typically the tag is a jump in salary, but compared to his market, the tag would probably be less than what Payne could get.\n\nOn one hand, because it is a one-year deal, Washington can not adjust his salary. For a five-year deal, the team can play with the cap. However, if Washington realizes their options are either to pay $21M, lose him for nothing, or pay $18.9M, the $18.9M is probably high on the table of options.\n\nWashington could tag him and then trade him. The team they trade him to could then extend him. That seems far more realistic than Washington just letting him walk.\n\nThe Commanders very well may struggle to work out a long-term deal with Payne, and Payne may end up on a different team. However, the tag and trade is the expected outcome if Payne does leave his team. Otherwise, Washington has to be thinking that letting Payne play on the franchise salary is not a bad deal.\n\nIt is very hard to see Chicago acquiring Payne outside of a tag and trade.",

During his career, Demps recorded 312 tackles, 18 interceptions, 4 forced fumbles, 3 fumble recoveries, and has a total of three career touchdowns. Demps played four years at the University of Texas at El Paso where he is second in program history with 17 interceptions.\n\n\u201cI want to first give glory and honor to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, he just continues to blow my mind with his unconditional love,\u201d said Demps. \u201cI am beyond excited for this opportunity to be the next head coach at Judson University. I look forward to building a culture where God is honored, academics is a priority, and football is a privilege. I want to thank the Judson administration for believing in me. It\u2019s time!\u201d\n\nDemps succeeds Dan Paplaczyk, who led Judson University through its first two seasons of competition. Under Paplaczyk\u2019s leadership, Judson collected its first six wins in program history and developed several key standout players on offense, defense, and special teams.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about having Quintin Demps as our next head coach,\u201d said Dr. Gene Crume, president of Judson University. \u201cHe\u2019s taking over a great foundation at a very important time in the history of the program.\u201d\n\nDemps most recently spent time as the Defensive Backs Coach for the Judson University Football Team. In addition, Demps has served as the Assistant Track and Field Coach at Judson. Demps previously was the Defensive Backs Coach at Trinity International University (TIU) and was the Defensive Coordinator at Grayslake Central High School. In addition, Demps was part of the Track and Field coaching staff at Grayslake Central. A student in TIU\u2019s mental health counseling program with a theology component, Demps feels that his mission is to work with young athletes.\n\n\u201cCoach Demps has proven to be a highly impactful and valuable member of our Judson Community,\u201d said Director of Athletics Rick Williams. \u201cHis work as a defensive backs coach has reached far beyond the confines of the football field. Many of our athletes attest to the positive, influential role he serves in their life by blending his love of Christ with his passion for sports and helping others. We look forward to watching God work through Coach Demps in this role.\u201d\n\nJudson University welcomes Demps as the Head Football Coach effective immediately.\n\nOriginal source can be found here",

Should they trade it for capital?\n\nWe got former NFL players saying they're hearing the Bears will take a quarterback and trade Justin Fields, even.\n\nOn ESPN, draft experts Mel Kiper Jr. and Todd McShay shared their opinions and they're vastly different.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\n\"What you don't do is trade Justin Fields and draft a quarterback,\" Kiper led off with.\n\nHe's previously said that if Fields was in this draft class he'd be his top-quarterback prospect. He also has the Bears using that No. 1 overall pick on Jalen Carter in his first mock draft.\n\n\"How do you see the Bears not trading out of the No. 1?\" McShay asked Kiper. \"You've got Houston, you've got Indy, you have teams that want a quarterback.\n\n\"You've got Bryce Young, you've got your number one quarterback in Will Levis, you've got C.J. Stroud, who you have going number one in terms of the quarterbacks in this class, why wouldn't the Bears trade the number one spot and get additional picks and try to build an organization?\"\n\nMcShay has also reported the Texans will try to trade down to No. 1.\n\nKiper does outline a scenario that would make the Bears salivate. But he cautions it's really dependent on the quarterback-needy teams feeing particularly enamored with a quarterback during the scouting process.\n\n\"What you hope to have happen is that Houston at No. 2 and Indy at No. 4 feel there's a quarterback we have to get we got to go get them,\" Kiper said. \"And if No. 2 Houston feels that way, go down to No. 1 from No. 2.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Then if Indy says, hey, we got to get that second quarterback. We've got to get that guy go down to No. 2 from No. 4. Then you know you're still getting a defensive player that can help you there.\n\n\"So you got to hope, if you're the Bears, that there's a quarterback that jumps out to those teams that they have to have.\n\n\"If they feel all three are equal, then it's going to be difficult to make that move down. So I think it depends upon really, guys, how these two teams, Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts, rank and grade those quarterbacks.\"\n\nThe Bears trading down twice to land ultimately at No. 4 is a dream scenario. The pick capital that would bring in for general manager Ryan Poles, while still having the Bears in position to draft either Will Anderson Jr or Jalen Carter, is ideal.\n\nBut we'll see what happens.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "Sunday's AFC and NFC championship games were a reminder of everything needed to get to the precipice of glory in the NFL. A reminder of everything Bears general manager Ryan Poles has to find as his rebuild efforts begin.\n\nYou can point to the power of the Eagles' offensive line or the relentlessness of their defensive front. You can look at the 49ers' ferocious and unrelenting defense or their litany of offensive weapons that allows for deadly versatility and multiplicity.\n\nThe Bears must fix the trenches on both sides of the ball. That has to be priority No. 1 this offseason. But you couldn't watch Sunday without noticing that three of the four teams vying for a Super Bowl berth had multiple elite pass catchers. The fourth, the Kansas City Chiefs, has one of the best tight ends in NFL history and the greatest quarterback in the league.\n\nThe Bears should be in the market for at least one top-tier pass-catcher this offseason. In reality, they need at least two more players who can win one-on-one matchups and make life easier for quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nCincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins is a name that has been floating around Bears Twitter for a few months. The dream is that Higgins, who is under contract for 2024, will ask the Bengals to trade him away from quarterback Joe Burrow and a team that has gone to back-to-back AFC title games, and the Bengals, having fallen into a state of delirium, will send him to the Bears.\n\nIt's a tremendous dream. Higgins is an elite jump-ball receiver who would help open up the field for Darnell Mooney and lighten the expectations for Chase Claypool.\n\nBut I fail to see a reality where the Bengals nuke their Super Bowl window by sending one of their three core players to Chicago.\n\nLet's go through the details.\n\nHiggins remains under contract through next season. I'd guess the Bengals will work on extensions for him and Burrow this offseason. Ja'Marr Chase still has two seasons and a fifth-year option left on his rookie contract.\n\nSince Burrow still has one season and a fifth-year option left on his rookie deal, the notoriously frugal Bengals actually find themselves in a decent spot to keep all three in Cincinnati without eviscerating their cap for several years.\n\nIt's a fair assumption that the Bengals will get the mega-extension done with Burrow this offseason. Assuming they map it out as the Chiefs did with Patrick Mahomes and the Bills with Josh Allen, the big numbers for Burrow won't start rolling in until the 2025 season. Chase's big money won't start coming in until the 2026 campaign, assuming it's handled similarly.\n\nThat should give the Bengals the ability to extend Higgins and have a large chunk of that money guaranteed at signing to lower the initial cap hit. This past offseason, the 49ers signed Deebo Samuel to a three-year, $58 million extension with a $24 million signing bonus. That signing bonus made Samuel's cap hit for 2023, the first year of the extension, just $8.6 million with a $1 million base salary.\n\nGiven that Higgins, Burrow, and Chase will each have their extensions kick in one year apart, the Bengals should be able to spread it out enough to keep all three in the fold and reload the roster around them. The Bengals also don't have a lot of money on the books at the moment, so the expected hard financial decisions likely will focus on players like safety Jessie Bates, running back Joe Mixon, wide receiver Tyler Boyd, and edge rusher Trey Hendrickson. Burrow, Chase, and Higgins should be penciled into the Bengals' future in ink.\n\nAfter the Bengals' loss to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday, Higgins was asked about his future in Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to play with Joe (Burrow) for a while,\" Higgins told reporters. \"He\u2019s a great guy and a great quarterback. We have developed a really good friendship, but you know how the league works. I still have another year on my deal though, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThat \"we'll see\" might seem like enough to keep the dream alive, but it's just Higgins being where his feet are, knowing things can always change.\n\nBut he'd have to want the change. He'd have to want to leave Burrow, Chase, and a team that seems primed to contend for Super Bowls for, if you ask Burrow, the next 15 years. The Bengals would also have to agree to deal an essential part of their success for a draft pick and the belief they can find another Tee Higgins.\n\nEven if Higgins wanted out, and there's no indication that's the case, the Bengals could just do what the 49ers did with Samuel last offseason. Samuel requested a trade, the 49ers declined it, stared him down, knowing they had the contract leverage, and finally ironed out a deal. That the Bengals are now a perennial Super Bowl contender and Higgins has a good connection and friendship with Burrow makes it all the more unlikely that a request will come.\n\nWhile the Bengals are known for their frugality, they also have been a franchise that prefers to keep their homegrown players. As long as the Bengals are willing to pay Higgins, there's no reason to believe he'll be playing anywhere but Cincinnati for the next handful of years.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "summary": "\nSunday's AFC and NFC championship games highlighted the importance of having strong offensive lines, a relentless defensive front, and multiple elite pass catchers. This is what Bears general manager Ryan Poles must focus on as he begins his rebuild efforts this offseason, particularly in terms of finding at least two more players who can win one-on-one matchups to help quarterback Justin Fields. Despite speculation that Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins may be traded away from Cincinnati due to their Super Bowl window being open for the next 15 years, it is unlikely given the Bengals' preference for keeping homegrown players and their ability to work out an extension with him."

            "text": "The Chicago Bears are primed for a second consecutive roster makeover with over two dozen players coming out of contract, but this time there are a handful of free agents that the team may consider part of the future. Positional value, league-wide demand, versatility, and leadership, are all some of the things that will be considered. Still, with a massive amount of cap space at their disposal, the Bears will have plenty of options.\n\nWhich of the current group of free agents do you think the Bears must bring back?\n\nYou can click here for a list of all the Bears' unrestricted, restricted, and exclusive rights free agents.\n\nA recent Pro Football Focus article from Brad Spielberger listed one free agent that each NFL team can't afford to lose, and Brad had linebacker Nicholas Morrow as his choice for the Bears. Here's what he had to say:\n\nThe Bears got ahead of a pending free agent situation at off-ball linebacker by trading Roquan Smith to the Baltimore Ravens at the deadline, and they will be doing a whole lot more adding than subtracting this upcoming offseason. Realistically, they can afford to lose anyone because they can also afford to add anyone. That said, they can\u2019t spend big at every single position, and while off-ball linebacker may resemble the deepest position in all of free agency, Morrow is a solid all-around player who can play at the Will or Mike spots in Matt Eberflus\u2019 defense. Morrow logged a career-high 1,086 snaps and earned his second consecutive coverage grade above 60.0 this past season. He could be a nice depth piece with starting potential on a cheap deal, a familiar face on a roster that is about to have very few in two months\u2019 time.\n\nMorrow plays a position that isn't usually given big money, he's coming off a one-year deal worth just $3 million, and as Brad says, Morrow has positional versatility.\n\nThe Bears appear content to roll into the 2023 season with Jack Sanborn getting the first crack at the Mike position, and while I feel they need to try and upgrade the Will, Morrow can play the Sam and chip in on special teams too. He'll turn 28 this summer, so age isn't a factor, which makes Morrow a no-brainer to bring back as a possible starter and, at the very least, solid depth.\n\nThe latest Bears' 2023 salary cap estimate from Over The Cap comes in lower than previously thought, but it's still the most in the league by a wide margin. They currently have Chicago at $91,833,199 in cap space, with $82,252,399 in effective cap space, which is about $30 million more than any other team has to spend.\n\nWhich pending free agent do you think is a must the Bears bring back?",

They lead the league in dead cap, which aided the Bears in gaining the number one draft pick this spring. Now they head into the offseason with the most money to spend in free agency by a wide margin. The Bears will have even more money in their coffers from a salary cap increase in 2023.\n\nAccording to Tim Pelissero with the NFL Network, the league is raising the salary cap from $208.2 million in 2022 to $224.8 million in 2023. That\u2019s a $16.6 million increase or a 7.97 percent increase over 2022.\n\nThe NFL informed teams today that the 2023 salary cap will be a record $224.8 million per club, sources tell me and @RapSheet. That\u2019s up from $208.2 million in 2022, $182.5M in 2021 (COVID adjustment), 198.2M in 2020 and $188.2M in 2019. \u2014 Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 30, 2023\n\nThe Bears lead the league in cap space\n\nAccording to Spotrac, the Bears will have $98 million in cap space this offseason.\n\nThe team with the second most cap space is the Atlanta Falcons, who have $56 million for 2023.

            "text": "Seeing small-school offensive linemen Jones (Southern Utah) and Carter (Southern) hold their own against prospects from Division I powerhouses at the Senior Bowl helped convince the Bears to draft them.\n\nJones was inserted as the starting left tackle during OTAs the first week of June and never relinquished the position. He not only opened all 17 games as a rookie but was the only Bears player who played every snap in 2022. The 6-5, 310-pounder was named to the 2022 NFL All-Rookie Team by Pro Football Focus and the Pro Football Writers of America.\n\nPoles and company will be seeking similar gems in Mobile this week. Senior Bowl practices will be held Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with the game scheduled to kick off Saturday at 1:30 p.m. (CT). All three practices will be televised on NFL Network and ESPN, while the game will be aired live on NFL Network.\n\nThe practices and the game will be held at Hancock Whitney Stadium on the campus of the University of South Alabama.\n\nThe Bears, who have the first pick in the draft for the first time since 1947, will have an even better opportunity to evaluate the prospects than usual, with offensive coordinator Luke Getsy serving as head coach of the American team. In addition to Getsy, linebackers coach Dave Borgonzi, assistant special teams coach Carlos Polk and assistant tight ends coach Tim Zetts will also be part of the game's coaching staffs.\n\nThis year marks the first time that two full staffs from NFL teams will not be coaching the Senior Bowl. Under a new arrangement to promote professional development, NFL Football Operations has implemented a \"coach up\" format where coordinators and assistant coaches are placed into elevated or different roles from the ones they currently hold with their clubs.\n\nHead coaches and general managers from all non-playoff teams had the opportunity to nominate assistant coaches. Those candidates were then selected by a group comprised of league office executives, representatives from the General Managers Advisory Committee and Senior Bowl leadership.\n\nIn total, at least one coach from all 16 teams that submitted nominations were chosen and six clubs had multiple coaches appointed to this year's American and National rosters (Bears 4, New Orleans Saints 4, Washington Commanders 4, Las Vegas Raiders 3, Cleveland Browns 2, and Pittsburgh Steelers 2).",

            "text": "Besides having the top pick in the draft, the Bears have the most available salary cap space and how much became more clear on Monday when the league revealed the cap number.\n\nThe Bears have a little more salary cap space Monday after the NFL announced the actual cap will be higher than many projections.\n\nThe rich get richer.\n\nThe salary cap is actually $224.8 million, which is up by $16.6 million from last year and this only makes sense because the cap was held down in 2021 by the COVID adjustment.\n\nFor the Bears, this means they're currently at $98,638,266 available under the cap, by far the most in the NFL according to Spotrac.com.\n\nAtlanta at $56.4 million, Cincinnati at $44.5 million, the Giants at $44.4 million and the Patriots at $38.1 million are the next closest to the Bears.\n\nWhat can a team do with almost $98 million in cap space? The answer \"anything they want,\" isn't quite true. In fact, GM Ryan Poles at season's end cautioned against thinking they'd go on a wild spending spree. But the cap figure suggests otherwise.\n\nThey actually do have a few contract extensions they'll need the cash to make, including wide receiver Darnell Mooney, cornerback Jaylon Johnson and tight end Cole Kmet. All three are players held in high regard by the team.\n\nThey may need to have money set aside for wide receiver Chase Claypool should they decide they want to keep him. It sounds as though they want to see more from him first.\n\n\"In terms of the contract stuff, we just got to take the next step, see how he gets implemented and how he does in this offseason,\" GM Ryan Poles said of Claypool. \"He's going to spend a lot of time with Justin as well as the other receivers and build that chemistry. We'll evaluate that even clearer next year.\"\n\nIf they want to keep David Montgomery, whose contract expires in March, then they also need cash. Poles said this becomes a matter of finding \"common ground\" in talks with Montgomery's agent.\n\nBeyond that, the addition of key free agents will be important and the Bears should be able to make several significant signings.\n\nFor instance, the Jacksonville Jaguars made seven major free agent acquisitions last year and had only about $60 million in cap space when they put together an offense and defense capable of supporting Trevor Lawrence for a run to the AFC divisional playoffs.\n\nTwitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMaven",
