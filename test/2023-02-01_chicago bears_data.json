He had a great meeting when he (was) there and liked all the guys that were doing stuff there. He thought he was going to be a Bear.\"\n\nGet Chicago local news, weather forecasts, sports and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Chicago newsletters.\n\n\"And then once they traded up and got Mitch, it kind of hurt him. It really did.\"\n\nMORE: Patrick Mahomes thought the Bears were going to draft him\n\nMahomes will forever be remembered as the one that got away from the city of Chicago.\n\nIn just five seasons as a starting quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, he's racked up five Pro Bowl nods, two All-Pro selections, one MVP award (likely another this season) and a Super Bowl ring, with a potential for his second coming up.\n\nOn Tuesday, David Haugh, Mark Grote and NBC Sports Chicago's Josh Schrock discussed the potential of Mahomes in Chicago, and what could have come from the collaboration.\n\nCould Mahomes have led the Bears to a Super Bowl?\n\n\"I'm going to go false,\" Shrock said. \"I'm going to break everyone's heart. I think Patrick Mahomes is sensational. He's probably the greatest talent we've ever seen at quarterback. But, a lot of his success is due to the situation he found himself in. Andy Reid. He got to sit a whole year behind Alex Smith. He comes in, has Tyreek Hill, has Travis Kelce, has all the weapons, a great head coach.\n\n\"He comes to Chicago, is Matt Nagy, Allen Robinson, Taylor Gabriel going to get that done? I don't think so.\"\n\nWould the Bears have been in a Super Bowl by now if they drafted Patrick Mahomes? \ud83e\udd14@Schrock_And_Awe, @DavidHaugh & @markgrotesports have the debate pic.twitter.com/3AIXLa1lKk \u2014 Bears Talk (@NBCSBears) February 1, 2023\n\nIn contrast to Trubisky's premiere season in the league, Mahomes made one start in his rookie season, allowing him the full submersion of the Chiefs' offense before taking the field. Trubisky, on the other hand, overtook Mike Glennon immediately, starting 12 games in his rookie season.\n\nHowever, despite the potential mishap of needing to play him in 2017, the Chicago Bears had an optimal situation, starting with their defense.\n\nThe Bears finished first amongst opponent points per game in 2018, allowing just 17.6 per game during the regular season. They also allowed the third least opponent yards per game, permitting just under 300 yards per game.\n\n\"I think the answer is true,\" Bears reporter Mark Grote said. \"I do believe that Patrick Mahomes would have led the Bears into a Super Bowl because talent, no matter what the structure is with an organization \u2013 and it was shaky at times with the Bears \u2013 top talent like that, supreme talent finds a way.\n\n\"And one thing that Ryan Pace did well was build \u2013 at least for a year and maybe a year and a half \u2013 an elite defense. Not just with free agents, but with draft picks, both safeties with Eddie Jackson, Adrian Amos, linebacker Roquan Smith, the signing of Akeem Hicks, a defensive line that every year was actually pretty good at refreshing itself.\"\n\nAs Grote mentioned, Mahomes would have stepped into a decently desirable situation with the Bears.\n\nThe aforementioned defense, certainly, was built to compete in a deep playoff, even a Super Bowl situation. Yes, their offensive weapons were limited, but Allen Robinson was on the cusp of becoming an elite receiver in the league, catching for 754 yards in 2018, but over 1,100 yards in each of the 2019 and 2020 seasons.\n\nRunning backs Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen combined for 17 total touchdowns. And, Trubisky was indeed a Pro Bowl quarterback in 2018. What would Mahomes have been under then Coach of the Year Matt Nagy?\n\nSurely, in the long run, the sustained success may not have lasted. David Haugh interjected into the conversation to argue history likely would have changed if Mahomes played in Chicago for the 2017 season.\n\n\"If he would have played and given that hope, maybe John Fox doesn't get fired, maybe they don't have 2018. I think it's emphatically false,\" Haugh said. \"I think that we want to believe that things would have been so much better because they got the quarterback. But, I think it was a blessing in disguise the Bears never called. It was the best thing that ever happened to Patrick Mahomes. Ryan Pace might have misled them.\"\n\n\"What you guys are both saying is that Patrick Mahomes is system-dependent,\" Grote said. \"I don't think he's system dependent. I think Patrick Mahomes is a true talent. You guys are lessening his talent when you say that he would not have risen to the top with the Bears.\"\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

Had this happened, it is speculated that the Bears could have been in a Super Bowl with an elite defense and offensive weapons such as Allen Robinson and Jordan Howard. However, due to Ryan Pace's decision to draft Mitch Trubisky instead of Mahomes, the future Hall-of-Famer ended up in Kansas City where he has since won an MVP award and a Super Bowl ring. Despite this missed opportunity for Chicago fans, many believe it was ultimately beneficial for both sides involved."

There are a few quarterbacks that have garnered a lot of attention and multiple teams that are in desperate need of a quarterback.\n\nIt is expected that the Bears, which will likely select a defensive player, will trade the No. 1 overall pick for some hefty compensation. A team that needs a quarterback to take the next step would be willing to lose picks and possibly players to select the franchise QB of the future.\n\nHowever, if the Bears can\u2019t find a partner or if the front office can\u2019t get a deal done in time, there is a clear answer as to who should be selected with that pick: Will Anderson Jr., EDGE from the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nVinnie Iyer of SportingNews writes in his latest 2023 NFL mock draft,\n\n\u201cThe Bears, picking first overall for the first time since 1947, shouldn\u2019t need to consider QB with the passing and running ceiling of big-armed Justin Fields. The ideal scenario is trading down for extra first-down selection power with a team looking to jump the Texans for a particular franchise QB. If the Bears stay, they should look to get familiar defensive pop. Anderson would give them a new Khalil Mack after also saying goodbye to Robert Quinn and Roquan Smith on the second level.\u201d\n\nBeing compared to some of the active greats of the league is certainly high praise. Anderson showcased his abilities in Tuscaloosa and made it clear that he was already playing above a collegiate level.

In 1979, they moved into the original Halas Hall at Lake Forest College, which also served as the corporate headquarters.\n\nIn 1997, the current Halas Hall opened in the Conway Park office complex near the Tri-State Tollway.

He went down with a high ankle sprain in Week 1. He also missed games that season due to a hamstring pull.\n\nThomas missed the entire 2021 season due to lingering issues from that initial ankle sprain. The Saints initially recommended he get surgery to repair the ankle in January of that year, though Thomas sought a second opinion and ultimately declined the surgical option, per the Sporting News. He eventually reversed course and underwent a procedure much later in the offseason, which ultimately cost him the full year.\n\nThe public rift that developed between the Saints and Thomas due to arguments surrounding his injury, eventual surgery and rehabilitation served as the catalyst for what will be the receiver\u2019s exit from the franchise come June 1.\n\nBears Displayed Propensity For Risk in Trade For Chase Claypool\n\nWhile his health issues remain a major concern \u2014 Thomas also missed 14 games in 2022 due to a toe injury and a subsequent surgery \u2014 the Bears have already shown a willingness to take big swings on calculated risks.\n\nThe Bears dealt their second-round pick, No. 32 overall, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in return for Chase Claypool. Giving up an asset that substantial for a wideout who was middling, at best, in 2022 is something of a harbinger for the types of moves the Bears are willing to make in free agency.\n\nThomas will play next season at the age of 30 and is well worth a significant investment if Chicago believes his health issues can, and will, turn around.",

            "text": "One thing people should remember about all of this speculation is the facts. The Chicago Bears finished the 2022 season with a 3-14 record. That was the worst in the NFL. That means nobody on this roster should be safe outside of a few names. GM Ryan Poles will keep his draft picks from last year. Justin Fields is safe too (unless he\u2019s traded). Everybody else shouldn\u2019t feel comfortable going into this off-season. Poles has every justification necessary to make changes if he senses an opportunity to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat leads to interesting discussions about players he may decide to move on from. Perhaps he might pull the plug on Al-Quadin Muhammad after a rough first season in Chicago. Kicker Cairo Santos struggled with extra points all season, hurting the team in some tight games. Former Ryan Pace draft picks Trevis Gipson and Kindle Vildor also failed to distinguish themselves. However, Adam Jahns of The Athletic seems to think there is one prominent name that should be circled for the chopping block.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s read the tea leaves. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the Bears parted with Whitehair. He never came up when Poles discussed the offensive line in his season-ending news conference. That\u2019s not to say that Poles, Eberflus and their respective staffs didn\u2019t respect Whitehair or value what he brought. They did. But Poles commended Riley Reiff after the season. \u201cThat guy did more than a lot of people think for that O-line room and the mentality,\u201d he said. Teven Jenkins and Braxton Jones were the only other linemen mentioned by name.\u201d\n\n3. Cody Whitehair was abused by Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nFor a guy with over 100 games of experience, it was like he'd never seen stunts before.\n\n\n\nHis pass protection was never great, but it's regressed this year.\n\n\n\nIt might be time the cut the cord. #Bears pic.twitter.com/b0Pv4uhEBA \u2014 Erik Lambert (@ErikLambert1) December 19, 2022\n\nRewatching some film from last season.\n\n\n\nKingsley Keke wins this rep against Cody Whitehair and the Packers' defensive lineman gives Justin Fields a decent hit, but Fields still makes an accurate throw to Darnell Mooney despite the pressure.\n\n\n\nNice 19-yard gain. pic.twitter.com/S6siaDY2SK \u2014 Nicholas Moreano (@NicholasMoreano) June 28, 2022\n\nThe Chicago Bears have to face facts on Whitehair.\n\nHe turns 31 years old this July. He missed five games this season will injuries. He also struggled a lot in pass protection toward the end of the year. This comes after his worst pass-protecting season in 2021. It is fair to presume that the Bears have seen the best of Whitehair and he has begun a steady decline. He\u2019s been their most consistent and dependable blocker over the past several years. That may no longer be the case. Perhaps he can sell them on his solid run blocking, but the Bears must improve Fields\u2019 protection. If he is seen as a liability in that regard, it is time to pull the plug.\n\nCutting him would net the Chicago Bears an additional $5.8 million in cap space. They don\u2019t really need it, but that isn\u2019t the point. It is about paving the way for players with a better chance to help this team win. Poles likely doesn\u2019t have to feel rushed on a Whitehair decision. The Bears can go through their entire off-season seeking offensive line help. If they find guard options they deem favorable, then they can move on from Whitehair. If they don\u2019t, then keep him around for one more year.",

            "text": "The Sean Payton saga appears to be over. According to multiple reports, Payton will return to the NFL as the next head coach of the Denver Broncos.\n\nSince Payton was still under contract with the New Orleans Saints when he retired, the Broncos had to trade for him. The Saints will receive a first-round pick in 2023, plus their second-round pick in 2024. In exchange the Broncos get Payton and a 2024 third-round pick. It\u2019s worth noting that the first-round pick the Saints will receive is the No. 29 pick in the draft, not the No. 5 pick. The latter one belongs to the Seahawks now, since the Broncos traded it away in their blockbuster deal to acquire Russell Wislon. The Broncos acquired the No. 29 pick from the Dolphins in exchange for Bradley Chubb.\n\nMany expected the Broncos to compete in the AFC West last year after bringing in Wilson, but that deal was a flop in year one. Wilson had career lows with a 60.5% completion rate and a 84.4 QB rating. Further, his 16:11 TD:INT ratio made him almost as much of a liability as a playmaker. The Broncos finished dead last in the division with a 5-12 record.\n\nThis will be Payton\u2019s first head coaching job outside New Orleans. He led the Saints from 2006-2021 and had a 152-89 record. He won the Coach of the Year award in his first season due the Saints\u2019 quick turnaround under his leadership. The team improved from a 3-13 record in 2005 to 10-6 in 2006. Three seasons later, Payton and the Saints won the Super Bowl.\n\nClick here to follow the Under Center Podcast.",

            "text": "Getsy has never been a head coach at any level. But he's getting the opportunity this week thanks to a new NFL initiative designed to promote professional development. For the first time, the league has implemented a \"coach up\" format where coordinators and assistant coaches are placed into elevated or different roles from the ones they hold with their clubs.\n\nHead coaches and general managers from all non-playoff teams had the chance to nominate assistant coaches, and those candidates were then selected by a group comprised of league office executives, representatives from the General Managers Advisory Committee and Senior Bowl leadership.\n\n\"It's a tremendous opportunity,\" Getsy said. \"The exposure to the player is the main reason it's awesome. But to be able to meet other coaches and kind of learn from them, and on top of that maybe give them something, that part of it's the best.\n\n\"Any type of exposure like this is a great opportunity. Is it exactly the same [as being an NFL head coach]? No, but the structure, planning it all, putting it all together, all that stuff is really valuable for me.\"\n\nGetsy, 38, is entering his ninth season as an NFL assistant. Before being hired as Bears offensive coordinator in 2022, he spent seven years with the Packers as offensive quality control coach (2014-15), receivers coach (2016-17) and quarterbacks coach (2019-21), doubling as passing game coordinator in 2020-21.\n\nDuring that span, Getsy left Green Bay for one season, serving as offensive coordinator and receivers coach at Mississippi State in 2018. In that role, he recruited a handful of players he's coaching this week at the Senior Bowl: Oklahoma running back Eric Gray, Auburn defensive lineman Derick Hall, Mississippi receiver Jonathan Mingo, Tennessee defensive lineman Byron Young and Mississippi State defensive lineman Cameron Young.\n\nServing as Senior Bowl head coach won't only benefit Getsy. It'll also give the Bears a unique perspective entering the draft. Getsy will share the information he gleans from the prospects he's coaching with general manager Ryan Poles and the team's personnel department.",

            "text": "Justin Fields has not had a lot of support since the Chicago Bears traded up to draft him, but it might not be too late. The question, however, is what exactly does a new quarterback need to succeed?\n\nIntroduction\n\nIs a strong running game really the best way to help a new quarterback? How about a stiff defense? Over time, a considerable body of lore has developed over the best way to help new quarterbacks succeed. As usual, much of that lore is based on nothing more than one-off observations and tradition based on assumption instead of actual evidence. As a word of warning, if you truly believe that apples cannot even be compared to other apples because every orchard is just that unique, or if you think that quarterbacks and their teams are each like snowflakes falling in on a bright winter morning, I invite you to check out some of the excellent interviews and draft coverage we offer.\n\nRelated WCG NFL Draft Coverage\n\nHowever, if there really is a \u201ckey\u201d to developing a successful quarterback (or at least to helping a quarterback be a little more successful), then that key should present itself repeatedly over time. Some quarterbacks will succeed or fail on their own, obviously, but it should be possible to parse loose trends from recent history. Thus, this article series is going to offer descriptive analysis framed with as much as can be gleaned in the way of simple objective metrics. Football is too unpredictable for trends to be absolute, but patterns should present themselves more often than not if they are going to be invoked as the basis for decision-making.\n\nThe Quarterbacks\n\nIn order to have as consistent of a pool as possible, I am looking only at quarterbacks drafted after the rookie contract system went into effect (i.e. 2011); likewise, I am only looking at quarterbacks drafted long ago enough that we can assess whether or not they in fact became franchise quarterbacks for their team after their initial 4-year contracts were up (so the pool ends in 2018). I am also ignoring all quarterbacks drafted after the first two rounds who did not start at least ten games in their first five years, quarterbacks who were traded (like Jacoby Brissett), quarterbacks who were spent most of their time as backups for established starters (like Mason Rudolph), and quarterbacks whose careers and potential were limited by injury (like Robert Griffin III). I kept track of all of those players for deeper discussion, but for the primary analysis I only wanted to look at quarterbacks who had a legitimate shot at being The Guy.\n\nThis gave me 36 potential candidates. I then evaluated each of these candidates by five criteria\u2013did he have at least 40 starts in his first 80 potential games, did he earn a first Pro Bowl or AP1 distinction within five years, did he earn a second Pro Bowl or AP1 distinction in five years, did he have a playoff win within five years, and did his team keep him for at least a fifth year? A player with a score of \u20184\u2019 or \u20185\u2019 was deemed a success, and a player with a score of \u20180\u2019 was deemed a failure. The remaining twelve quarterbacks were tracked but not deemed successes or failures.\n\nThis gave me the following list of successful quarterbacks who fulfilled every criteria unless noted: Andy Dalton, Cam Newton, Andrew Luck, Russell Wilson, Dak Prescott, Jared Goff, Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Kirk Cousins (missing a second Pro Bowl), Derek Carr (missing a playoff win), and Deshaun Watson (not kept for a fifth year).\n\nThe list of failed quarterbacks, meanwhile, looks like this: Christian Ponder, Jake Locker, Brandon Weeden, EJ Manuel, Mike Glennon, Geno Smith, Johnny Manziel, Paxton Lynch, Cody Kessler, Trevor Siemian, DeShone Kizer, and Josh Rosen.\n\nThe Candidates Themselves\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense to \u201caverage\u201d draft position, as indicated by the fact that the successful group had an average draft round of 1.83 compared to the 2.0 of the failure group even though only six of these candidates were drafted in the second round at all. Slightly more interesting is the fact that the \u201csuccessful\u201d quarterbacks averaged being roughly the fourth quarterback selected (3.9), with the \u201cfailure\u201d group being a little higher in the pecking order (3.5), but that just shows why averages only have limited value with pools this small. After all, of sixteen quarterbacks taken in the Top 10, five were successes and only two were failures. While the top quarterback taken was successful 3 out of 8 times, only 1 of the 7 quarterbacks taken second in a year was successful (Patrick Mahomes).\n\nFor those wondering, the \u201cmissing\u201d second quarterback is Robert Griffin III, who was disqualified due to injury.\n\nI have a database of quarterbacks who pass the various elements of the \u201cParcells Test\u201d (save graduating college). I have previously failed to find much evidence that the Parcells test works, but it is worth reconsidering it in light of the stricter standards for success in this review (and one piece of additional information that I will cover later). The twelve successful quarterbacks fulfilled anywhere from two elements of the Parcells\u2019 test (e.g. Josh Allen) to six (e.g. Russell Wilson), the exact same range as the twelve failed quarterbacks (and, for that matter, the twelve in the middle). Someone who feels strongly about the Parcells\u2019 test can take comfort in the fact that the successful group had a mean score of 4.8 whereas the failure group had a mean score of 4.3 (with the middle group at 4.5). However, given the small sample size and the closeness of these numbers, this is basically a candidate or two off from being even. However, there is slightly more to it than that.\n\nFour of the twelve successful quarterbacks sat for at least the first eight games of their first season before starting, including three of the five who underperformed the most on the Parcells test. In fact, nine of the twelve successes either passed the Parcells test or sat for at least half a year. The three exceptions are Cam Newton, Josh Allen, and Deshaun Watson (and Watson passed five of the six recorded markers Parcells would have wanted). Given Josh Allen\u2019s pronounced early struggles, the argument could be made that Cam Newton is the only true outlier for a softened \u201cParcells or Sit\u201d rule.\n\nMeanwhile, the only two failures to sit were Jake Locker and Trevor Siemian. Locker is the more pronounced case, obviously, in that he was taken in the top ten and therefore might reasonably be expected to play sooner rather than later. Siemian was less \u201csitting\u201d than he was a backup quarterback who eventually got a chance to start.\n\nThe Drafting Teams\n\nWhere things get even more interesting is looking at the teams that drafted these candidates. Of the twelve successful quarterbacks, eleven were drafted by teams with at least ten wins in the previous two seasons combined, and five of those went to teams that had at least sixteen wins across the previous two seasons. However, of the nine quarterbacks drafted by teams with fewer than ten wins across the prior two seasons, only one met the criteria for success, and he is the only \u201csuccess\u201d not to have a playoff win in his first five years\u2014Derek Carr. While being drafted by an average team is not a guarantee of success, by any means, the number of quarterbacks who succeeded after being drafted by such a team outnumber those who failed by nearly 2:1. Two of the only three failures were both drafted by Denver on the downswing of their Super Bowl run (Siemian and Lynch); the other was Christian Ponder.\n\nI was curious if this was simply an indicator of whether or not the quarterbacks in question went into unstable coaching situations, but both failures and successes went through an average of 1.42 coaches in their first three years in the league (or in their total run playing if they did not make it three years).\n\nWhen I refer to a quarterback\u2019s \u201cstart\u201d, I typically took the ranks and numbers from his team during his first three seasons of actual play or for as long as he was able to play if he did not make it three years. If a quarterback sat for less than half of a year, I included that season.\n\nPerhaps Running Helps?\n\nPerhaps those \u201cwinning\u201d teams (or, let\u2019s be honest, less-losing teams) provided their new quarterbacks with a strong running game in order to set them up for success? Maybe not. A workhorse running back does not seem to be the key. Looking at each team\u2019s #1 running back for the start of each candidate\u2019s career, seven quarterbacks enjoyed being partnered with what was on average a top ten running back in yards per season, and less than half of these players (3) went on to success. At the other end, of the sixteen quarterbacks paired with a running back outside of the top twenty, and six were clear successes (Mahomes, Newton, Jackson, Carr, Allen, and Luck) with only four turning out to be clear failures (Kizer, Manziel, Weeden, and Glennon).\n\nDid Russell Wilson and Dak Prescott benefit from Lynch and Elliott respectively? Certainly. Christian Ponder got no such boost from Peterson, though, and Josh Allen and Andrew Luck did not need a top running back to help them out. Having a top running back does not seem to be necessary for a quarterback to succeed and it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s sufficient to make a difference consistently.\n\nThe trend gets only slightly more interesting if we look at the strength of the running game as a whole. Of the twelve quarterbacks who enjoyed teams that were in the top ten in average rushing yards, five were successes and another three were failures. Likewise, of the five quarterbacks who were on teams with an average number of rushing yards in the bottom ten, three of those were failures (Glennon, Weeden, and Rosen) while two were successes (Carr and Dalton). Here it\u2019s worth remembering that it can be difficult to separate cause and effect, and it is likely that some of the poor rushing results of the Buccaneers, Browns, and Cardinals in those earlier cases were due to no defense fearing their passing games. Still, it\u2019s hard to find a clear trend at all unless we look at one more number.\n\nOf the thirty-six quarterbacks under consideration, eight played for teams that were in the top ten in terms of rushing attempts per season for each of their first three seasons (or, again, for their active seasons). Half of those were successes and only two were failures. Meanwhile, nine played for teams that were in the bottom ten in terms of rushing attempts. Two were successes but six were failures. That\u2019s not conclusive at all, but that strong of a disparity is worth noting.\n\nThe simplest explanation is that having a \u201cgood\u201d running game is not a clear advantage, but being willing to run the football even without clear results does seem to do something to help take pressure off of the quarterback. It doesn\u2019t seem like the rushing attempts need to be particularly effective, they just need to be there. A deeper dive should also consider that at least some of the success enjoyed by these run-a-lot teams comes from the quarterbacks themselves doing the running (Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson come to mind).\n\nOne more thought before moving on to defense, though. There are the five quarterbacks who enjoyed the services of a tight end who was in the top ten in terms of average receiving yards in their formative years: Patrick Mahomes, Carson Wentz, Lamar Jackson, Marcus Mariota, and Cam Newton. Not only do all of those players come from teams whose top running back was outside of the top twenty, three of them are successes. In fact, six of the twelve successful quarterbacks had an RB1 or TE1 who was in the top ten in total yards during their formative years. Christian Ponder is also the only quarterback to have one or the other and still turn out as a distinct failure. Again, it is difficult to sort out cause and effect, but that is suggestive of the idea that a safety valve of some kind is valuable for a developing quarterback\u2013even if it\u2019s not always the traditional workhorse halfback.\n\nDefense is Friend-shaped\n\nDefense is a simpler story, because there is a clear trend. Of the eight teams with a defense in the top ten in terms of points allowed, half fielded new quarterbacks who turned out as successes and none were failures. Of the twelve with a defense in the bottom ten? Only two were successes and six were failures. One of those two successes (Carr) is also the only success without a playoff win in his first five years; the other (Cousins) is the only one without multiple Pro Bowls. At the other end of the spectrum, Mitchell Trubisky is the only first-round draft pick to be partnered with what was on average a top ten defense and still not make it as a success.\n\nSimply denying the other team yards overall has less clear results, though. Of the thirteen teams in the top ten in that regard, five had successful quarterbacks and four had failures. Even here, though, a defense that struggles too much is not a good sign. Of the seven teams in the bottom ten, four quarterbacks were failures and Carr was the only success. So, of the two truisms calling for a good running game or a good defense to aid a new quarterback, recent anecdotes definitely favor the defense.\n\nPreliminary Observations\n\nWithout diving into any really complex math, here are the quarterbacks with the best \u201caverage\u201d defense (points allowed and yards allowed) combined with the strongest average running game (rushing attempts and RB1 rank). They have an average overall \u201chelp\u201d rank in the top ten, with successes being starred: Russell Wilson*, Colin Kaepernick, Dak Prescott*, Brock Osweiler, Lamar Jackson*, Mitchell Trubisky (10.17), Andy Dalton (10.17)*. Substituting in tight end yards for the running game adds Patrick Mahomes* and Carson Wentz.\n\nMeanwhile, here are the quarterbacks who went into the most \u201cstable\u201d situations (teams with at the most wins prior to their being drafted without experiencing a coaching change): Patrick Mahomes*, Christian Ponder, Deshaun Watson*, Carson Wentz, Lamar Jackson*, Josh Allen*, and Dak Prescott*.\n\nHere are the quarterbacks on both lists, thereby representing the players who were drafted into what have to be considered the best opportunities in football, at least superficially: Patrick Mahomes*, Carson Wentz, Lamar Jackson*, and Dak Prescott*.\n\nBy contrast, here is the list of those quarterbacks with an average \u201chelp\u201d rank in the bottom ten, with success stories again being starred: Cody Kessler, Mike Glennon, Blake Bortles, Brandon Weeden, Derek Carr*, Josh Rosen, DeShone Kizer, Sam Darnold, and Jake Locker.\n\nLikewise, here are the quarterbacks who landed on teams with fewer than ten wins and who also underwent a coaching change: Sam Darnold, Brandon Weeden, Marcus Mariota, Mitchell Trubisky, Derek Carr*, Blake Bortles, Jameis Winston, and Baker Mayfield.\n\nHere are the quarterbacks who went to the least stable teams with the least help, arguably making them doomed from the start by conventional reasoning: Blake Bortles, Brandon Weeden, Derek Carr*, and Sam Darnold. At this point, honestly, my strongest conclusion is that I have not appreciated enough exactly what Derek Carr has managed to overcome in his career.\n\nNext week, I want to evaluate the successes and failures a little more closely, and I want to start digging into the way teams constructed their rosters both before and after each new quarterback took over.",

Trying to get as much information on as many of these guys as possible.\u201d\n\nHe said he found himself stepping back at moments during practice and putting the coaching hat aside to evaluate players, who are learning the scheme on the fly and implementing it. College tape is king in the evaluation process, and combine results and medical information go a long way. But there are more pieces to the puzzle.\n\n\u201cSee how fast they learn something and go out and perform it quickly,\u201d Getsy said. \u201cThat is the world we live in. We can\u2019t do the same thing every week. Have to be able to adapt.\u201d\n\nIt was a challenge to learn the coaching staff assembled for the two rosters, with assistants from 16 of the league\u2019s 32 teams. That makes a clear line of communication essential. It also meant the week off that Bears coach Matt Eberflus gave his staff was a full week of planning for Getsy.\n\n\u201cThe exposure to the players is the main reason (for being here),\u201d he said. \u201cBut to be able to meet other coaches and kind of learn from them, and then on top of that maybe give them something, that part of it is the best. The networking part, getting to see good, young coaches, it has been a tremendous opportunity.\u201d\n\nSenior Bowl director Jim Nagy called Getsy \u201creally easy to deal with\u201d and credited Getsy with getting two offensive line coaches for each roster. Of course, that\u2019s a position the Bears will be looking at closely.\n\nNagy, a longtime NFL scout, shared a funny anecdote of how his request for two O-line coaches initially was denied.\n\n\u201cWhen the coaching list first came out, there was only supposed to be one offensive line coach,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cAnd on the first introductory call with the league when we were voting on the staffs, I was like, \u2018Guys, I don\u2019t think we can get through the week with one offensive line coach on each team.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen. I lobbied for it, I got shot down. And the next day I got a call from Luke and he was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re getting through the week with only one offensive line coach.\u2019 We see a lot of things the same.\u201d\n\nWith Getsy pushing for more help in the trenches, the league agreed to it.\n\nAs far as the Bears and working to help quarterback Justin Fields, Getsy said the staff hasn\u2019t started a deep dive into the specifics of the offseason plan.\n\n\u201dWhen we get back next week, we\u2019ll begin that phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all together, so when I get back we can hit that running.\n\n\u201cWe took that time to do exit interviews and I spent a lot of time with each guy. I made sure I spent 20 to 30 minutes with each guy to really dive into the process and make sure we\u2019re giving them everything they need to be successful.\u201d\n\nBear down (in Mobile)\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of head coaches present, but Eberflus was at both practices, spending time on his own and with general manager Ryan Poles. Other head coaches spotted included Brian Daboll (New York Giants), Dennis Allen (New Orleans Saints) and Mike Vrabel (Tennessee Titans).\n\nEberflus has to hire a defensive backs coach to replace James Rowe, who left for the University of South Florida.\n\nNuggets\n\nOhio State right tackle Dawand Jones was a mountain of a man during the National practice in the morning, mauling a handful of defensive ends. He measured 6-foot-8 and weighed 375 pounds with a incredible 89\u00bd-inch wingspan. Jones can make up for a lack of quickness with his sheer size and power, and that was on full display.\n\nMaryland left tackle Jaelyn Duncan looked good in the National practice as well. North Dakota State\u2019s Cody Mauch was working at left guard. Many NFL scouts believe Mauch projects as an interior lineman.\n\nAuburn defensive end Derick Hall had a nice practice for the American squad. He\u2019s 6-2, 252 with 34\u215c-inch arms and flashed a nice arm/under move getting to the quarterback. He has the range to play in space too.\n\nOregon State\u2019s Luke Musgrave projects as a Y tight end with the ability to be a big-time target in the middle of the field. A knee injury limited him to two games in the fall, but he looks like a Day 2 pick at worst.\n\nTwo American cornerbacks stood out: Kansas State\u2019s Julius Brents and Miami\u2019s Tyrique Stevenson.\n\n()",

            "text": "(670 The Score) The NFL informed its 32 teams Monday that the salary cap for the 2023 season will be set at $224.8 million, a record figure for the league. That's an increase of $16.6 million from 2022.\n\nWith that salary cap number in place and procedural spending already having begun, the Bears have an NFL-leading $98.6 million in estimated cap space heading into their pivotal offseason, according to Spotrac. Chicago also boasts eight selections in the 2023 NFL Draft, including the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nIt all means Bears general manager Ryan Poles is positioned for a potentially transformational offseason as he begins his second year leading the team.\n\n\u201cWhatever he\u2019s going to do, I fully trust him,\u201d Bears quarterback Justin Fields said of Poles. \u201cHis goal is to make the best team he can for us. I know he\u2019s going to do a great job of that. We're going to get better and work in the offseason.\u201d\n\nThe Bears have about $42 million more in available salary cap space than the Falcons, who have the second-most of any team in the NFL. The league average is $5.4 million per team in salary cap space, with 15 teams currently over the cap. Teams have until 3 p.m. CT on March 15 to get under the cap. That includes the rival Packers ($17.5 million over the cap) and the NFC North champion Vikings ($21.2 million over the cap).\n\nThe Bears find themselves in a similar position to where the Jaguars were in the 2022 offseason. Jacksonville was also coming off a 3-14 campaign, held the No. 1 overall pick and had ample salary cap space. The Jaguars then committed around $260 million, including $155 million guaranteed, in the first days of free agency to add playmakers like receiver Christian Kirk, receiver Zay Jones and tight end Evan Engram for young quarterback Trevor Lawrence as well as protection in the form of five-time Pro Bowl guard Brandon Scherff.\n\nThe Jaguars enjoyed a turnaround in 2022, going 9-8 in the regular season, earning the AFC South title and advancing to the NFL\u2019s divisional round.\n\nPoles has noted his desire for calculated spending this offseason with the hope of building toward sustained success.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is to take that next step,\u201d Poles said. \u201cI want to stair-step this thing to the top and then stay up there as absolutely long as possible.\u201d\n\nTeam can begin negotiating contracts with veteran free agents beginning at 11 a.m. CT on March 13.\n\nChris Emma covers the Bears, Chicago\u2019s sports scene and more for 670TheScore.com.
