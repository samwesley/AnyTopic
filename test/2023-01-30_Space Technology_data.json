            "text": "Installation of equipment at a station for China\u2019s first commercial spacecraft launch site started on January 29 in Wenchang, a city in China\u2019s southern island province of Hainan. The site is scheduled to complete work by the end of this year.\n\nThe installation has been undertaken by a company affiliated to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. The equipment includes a fixed service tower, diversion devices, a launch pad, water spraying systems, lightning protection towers, hoisting equipment and transition transportation equipment, among other items.\n\nThe commercial spacecraft launch site is invested in and built by Hainan International Commercial Space Launch Co., Ltd., which is committed to further enhancing the launch capabilities of Chinese commercial spacecraft. Located in the surrounding area of Wenchang Space Launch Site, it covers a total area of 133.33 hectares. Starting in July 2022, it has a construction period of 19 months and is expected to realize normal launches in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, a work report issued by the Hainan provincial government mentioned developing Wenchang into a \u201cspace city.\u201d The connections between Wenchang and aerospace are getting tighter and tighter. The Wenchang Space Launch Site is the first coastal launch site in China. In 2016, the Long March-7 carrier rocket was successfully launched there, transforming the city, which once relied on marine resources, into a world-famous space town.\n\nAs it is situated close to the equator, when launching satellites, the centrifugal force brought by the larger linear velocity and inertia can greatly reduce fuel consumption of rockets. This young launch site has successfully completed major missions such as the Long March-5B carrier rocket, the Tianhe core module, the Wentian module and the Mengtian module.\n\nWith the spurt development of aerospace technology, the industry is becoming a new powerful engine for current economic development. Commercial aerospace has expanded from the traditional fields of communication, navigation and remote sensing application satellites to manned spaceflight, space exploration, on-orbit services and other fields. More and more private enterprises and venture capital firms are entering the aerospace field.\n\nSEE ALSO: China\u2019s Shenzhou-14 Astronauts Return to Earth With Space-Grown Rice\n\nCompared with the mature commercial aerospace model abroad, China\u2019s commercial aerospace is still in its infancy, but it is developing rapidly. Up to now, there are hundreds of registered commercial aerospace companies in China. Among them, private aerospace enterprises account for more than 80%, mainly concentrated in the field of satellite applications and launches.\n\nHowever, the financing quota of startups in China\u2019s commercial aerospace field is far from sufficient. It takes at least one year to develop and launch a rocket, and long wait times make it impossible to match investment within the three to five years typically pursued by private equity funds. High risks and slow return times eventually lead to financing challenges.",

Bush announced that the eye-wateringly expensive programme would be retired.\n\nFor years after the last shuttle flight in 2011, NASA found itself dependent on Russia for transport to the International Space Station (ISS) until Elon Musk\u2019s Space X began flying passengers there in 2020.\n\nAs well as the Moon, Washington is now preparing for a manned mission to Mars, scheduled tentatively for the late 2030s or early 2040s.\n\n\u2018Trails of smoke\u2019\n\n\n\n\"To Columbia, here is Houston... we did not copy your last\" message.\n\nAfter a moment, Husband replied: \"Roger but...\"\n\nAfter a brief crackling noise, contact was lost.\n\nColumbia disappeared from radar screens at 9:00 am (1400 GMT), 16 minutes before it was due to land.\n\nThe flaming debris from the 80-tonne craft was caught streaking across the sky over the southern US by local TV stations, with parts scattered over Texas and Louisiana.\n\nBob Molter from Palestine, Texas, told National Public Radio how he saw the shuttle break up in the sky.\n\n\"There was a big boom that shook the house for more than a minute, and I went outside because I thought there had been a train accident on the nearby line.\n\n\"But there was nothing, and then I looked up and saw the trails of smoke zig-zagging, going across the sky.\"\n\nHeroes\n\n\n\nColumbia was the oldest shuttle to fly in orbit.\n\nWhen it took off on its 28th flight on January 16, 2003 for a 16-day mission to carry out experiments it had been in operation for over 20 years.\n\nFlight STS-107 was launched under extremely tight security in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks and due to the presence on board of Israel\u2019s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon.\n\nBush cut short a stay at the Camp David presidential retreat and raced back to Washington following the tragedy. In a televised address he hailed the crew, two of whom were women, as heroes.\n\nA probe revealed that the shuttle disintegrated due to damage caused by a piece of foam from the external fuel tank that took a chunk out of the orbiter\u2019s left wing during liftoff.\n\nThis left it unable to withstand the extreme temperatures generated by re-entry.\n\nEnd of shuttle programme\n\n\n\nThe shuttle programme was born in 1972 under president Richard Nixon and went on to become the major focus of US human spaceflight ambitions over the next four decades.\n\nThe fleet also acted like space trucks, carrying more than 1,500 tonnes of equipment to help build the first space telescope, Hubble, and the International Space Station.\n\nAfter the Columbia disaster, NASA underwent sweeping changes aimed at improving its culture and safety.\n\nThe agency resumed shuttle flights in July 2005, with Discovery, then Endeavour and finally Atlantis continuing to fly missions to the ISS until 2011.",

            "text": "Deep tech scale-ups produce highly engineered products with multiple levels of complex configurations, systems and sub-assemblies.\n\nOne piece of equipment might have up to 1 million components, take several hundred steps to assemble, and require regular adjustment from multiple specialist engineers.\n\nIn fact, the production line itself is often highly specialised and may even be as patent-protected as the final product.\n\nOffshoring requires relocating the entire plant overseas at great cost, unlike software production which can be (and often is) easily offshored. This makes deep tech manufacturing facilities incredibly \u201csticky\u201d to Australia.\n\n2. One becomes many\n\nDeep tech scale-ups create a spillover effect in the form of dozens, if not hundreds, of opportunities upstream and downstream in their own supply chains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, when Queensland\u2019s Gilmour Space Technologies launches into space, chief executive and founder Adam Gilmour says it takes about 300 manufacturing suppliers from Australia with it.\n\nBattery manufacturing company Gelion, a resident at deep tech incubator Cicada, just partnered with a local lead-acid battery manufacturer to launch a production facility for its sustainable zinc-bromide batteries using existing lead-acid processes, creating production efficiencies for both.\n\n3. Constant reinvestment builds sticky assets\n\nOnce a deep tech company reaches more than 500 R & D and production staff, it is deeply incentivised to continuously reinvest into its specialised facilities, real estate for production continuity, surrounding infrastructure, supporting supply chain, and highly specialised team.\n\nIt will also reinvest on average 15 to 20 per cent of its revenue back into R & D for the life of the company.\n\nAs an example, Cicada resident and biotech company SpeeDx constantly reinvests into R & D capabilities (team, infrastructure, experiments), industry-based PhD students (talent and research), and research collaborations with universities through multiple grant schemes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the ball starts rolling, it snowballs.\n\nThese scale-ups act as magnets for talent in roles such as senior production engineers, who can then train hundreds of staff beneath them. This is a strategy that some of Australia\u2019s largest medical devices companies, such as Cochlear, credit for their size and success.\n\nEach new anchor point and extra dollar of investment makes the company even stickier to Australia, while significantly improving the assets on the company\u2019s (and Australia\u2019s) balance sheet.\n\n4. Complex products guard against major events\n\nThe complex products produced by deep tech manufacturing scale-ups open up diverse export markets.\n\nThey also guard against major economic shifts that would otherwise dramatically increase a country\u2019s reliance on a small number of industries, or temporarily wipe out some.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the pandemic struck, the deep tech scale-ups within Cicada did not suddenly find themselves laying people off, they expanded product lines, hired staff and found new markets.\n\nThe problems they are solving \u2013 climate change, an ageing population, energy security \u2013 did not disappear just because a virus arrived.\n\nIn fact, many built new technology to \u201csave the world\u201d from COVID-19, proving their imperviousness to major events.\n\n5. IP equals higher pay\n\nResearch by IP Australia recently found that SMEs that own IP rights \u2013 as all deep tech scale-ups do \u2013 are more likely to experience high sustained growth, employ 3.5 times more people, and pay a higher median wage.\n\nThey are also more likely to provide a pathway for new STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates, reinvest in continued R & D, and collaborate across sectors with other SMEs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. It\u2019s worked before\n\nPerhaps the best reason for investing as a nation into complex deep tech manufacturing scale-ups is that we have overseas proof that it works.\n\nGermany\u2019s \u201cMittelstand\u201d \u2013 small and mid-size companies \u2013 are manufacturing and technology businesses that have endured multiple economic cycles, possess between 70 and 90 per cent share of their respective global markets, and account for the bulk of Germany\u2019s considerable trade surplus.\n\nThe Harvard Business Review describes them as \u201ctrue superstars\u201d that \u201chave a talent for export and a command of their markets that belie their small size and low profile\u201d, while Forbes says \u201cmany of these firms have all the ingredients for breakout success\u201d.\n\nIt is not inconceivable that Australia creates its own version of these robust, job-creating, high-employing companies too.",

            "text": "With the successful launch of Artemis I behind it, NASA has been doubling down on efforts to make deep space travel \u2013 and it\u2019s reported future trips to the Moon and Mars \u2013 easier to achieve. We\u2019ve already reported on why the Space Launch System used for the Artemis mission isn\u2019t sustainable, but now NASA has tested a new propulsion tech that could cut down on the fuel needed for those missions.\n\nThe new tech is called a rotating detonation rocket engine, or RDRE. This propulsion system uses detonations to generate thrust. To do this, the tech relies on the accelerating of a supersonic exothermic front, which similarly creates thrust to the way a shockwave travels through the atmosphere after an explosion, which could make deep space travel easier to build for.\n\nThe point of the design is to use less fuel while also providing more thrust than the current propulsion systems that NASA and other rocket-building companies rely on. Using less fuel makes it easier to prepare these spacecraft for deep space travel, as you can mete out smaller amounts of fuel that won\u2019t weigh down the rocket when it is lifting off.\n\nWith the success of this test, NASA is now looking at building a working, fully reusable 10,00-pound RDRE that it can then compare to the performance of traditional liquid rocket engines \u2013 like those used in the Space Launch System. If those tests prove successful, too, and the comparisons play out well, it could revolutionize how we think about deep space travel in the future.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only way that NASA is looking at revolutionizing deep space travel. The space agency is reportedly looking into nuclear-powered spacecraft, which would allow spacecraft to travel further distances without needing liquid fuel. It would also make the journey to Mars significantly shorter, from six months to just 45 days.",

By readying these technologies in an environment similar to what they will experience in space, NASA, industry, and universities can help reduce the potential cost and risk before deploying the technologies on longer, more expensive missions in Earth orbit or to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\n\u201cThis $6.1 million investment in technology testing will help mature technologies for agency goals, from space exploration to scientific discovery,\u201d said Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs in NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \u201cAnd in doing so, we\u2019re also providing significant support to help the commercial space industry thrive.\u201d\n\nThe technologies were selected by STMD\u2019s Flight Opportunities program, which rapidly demonstrates technologies for space exploration, discovery, and the expansion of space commerce. For the first time, the 2022 TechFlights solicitation included access to test opportunities hosted on commercial platforms and spacecraft in orbit in collaboration with the agency\u2019s Small Spacecraft Technology program.\n\n\u201cFlight Opportunities is excited to support these efforts to solve some of the most important challenges facing space exploration and Earth observation,\u201d said Danielle McCulloch, acting program manager for Flight Opportunities at NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. \u201cIn working with the Small Spacecraft Technology program this year to offer opportunities for payloads hosted aboard commercial orbital platforms we can expand our reach to advance even more technologies from a variety of institutions and technical disciplines.\u201d\n\nThe organizations developing the selected technologies will receive a grant or cooperative agreement allowing them to purchase flights from a U.S. commercial flight vendor that best meets their needs. As in previous years, the 2022 solicitation included options for researchers to fly automated technology experiments unattended or to have one or more researchers fly alongside their technology payload on parabolic flights or suborbital rockets.\n\nThe solicitation included three topic areas that reflect NASA priorities to further space exploration and scientific discovery goals. These topics focus on supporting infrastructure and capabilities for a robust lunar economy, services and infrastructure ranging from low-Earth orbit to geosynchronous Earth orbit, and Earth observation architectures, as well as systems to monitor and address climate change.\n\nThe selected technologies are:\n\nCreare in Hanover, New Hampshire, will test a device designed to support the transfer of liquid propellant from a supply tank to a receiving tank in microgravity as a potential solution for refueling satellites and spacecraft on long-duration missions. This technology is planned to fly on parabolic flights with Zero Gravity Corporation\u2019s (ZERO-G) G-Force One aircraft.\n\nGiner in Newton, Massachusetts, will test a fuel cell energy storage system designed as a potential power supply for future spacecraft or lunar surface operations to evaluate its gas-liquid phase separator in microgravity. This technology is planned to fly on ZERO-G\u2019s G-Force One.\n\nHarvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts will test an imaging and particle detector system that aims to improve the autonomous assessment of wildfire structure and spread. The system uses aerosol measurement instruments that could have applications on other planets. This technology is planned to fly on Aerostar\u2019s high-altitude balloon.\n\nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, will evaluate a technology designed to measure the variability of electrons present between a receiver on a suborbital flight vehicle and GPS satellites in orbit for its capabilities to inform atmospheric models. This technology is planned to fly on Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard rocket-powered system.\n\nParagon Space Development Corporation in Tucson, Arizona, will evaluate in microgravity a device for capturing and separating liquid condensation from cabin air to support spacecraft temperature and humidity control. This technology is planned to fly on ZERO-G\u2019s G-Force One.\n\nPurdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, will conduct an experiment to analyze heat transfer in cryogenic propellant storage for use in modeling and designing future propellant transfer and management systems. This technology is planned to fly on ZERO-G\u2019s G-Force One.\n\nRhea Space Activity in Washington, will test a guidance and navigation technology for small spacecraft with the aim of demonstrating its capabilities for autonomous orbit determination in cislunar space. This technology is planned to fly on Spaceflight\u2019s Sherpa orbital transfer vehicle.\n\nSan Diego State University in San Diego, California, will test a system aiming to improve spacecraft precision landing capabilities through adaptive navigation, allowing researchers to evaluate its performance on a rocket-powered lander. This technology is planned to fly on Astrobotic\u2019s Xodiac vehicle.\n\nUniversity of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky, will refine mechanisms for rehydrating red blood cells in a space environment. Such technology could be used to offer transfusion therapy for astronauts on long-duration space missions.

            "text": "The American space agency NASA is teaming up with a military research agency to develop a nuclear rocket designed to fly astronauts to Mars.\n\nNASA recently announced it would partner with the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on the effort. As the military\u2019s research and development group, DARPA has historically helped lead many notable inventions, including the beginnings of the internet.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the first nuclear-powered rocket test flight could be launched as soon as 2027.\n\nThe developing technology is called nuclear thermal propulsion. A rocket powered with this technology can travel much faster than with traditional chemical propulsion systems.\n\nNASA has long studied nuclear thermal propulsion for possible use for space travel. But its last engine tests using the technology took place more than 50 years ago. The government ended the development program for budget reasons and because of tensions linked to the Cold War.\n\nNASA has said with nuclear thermal propulsion, a trip to Mars could be completed in three to four months. This compares to about seven months with chemical propulsion. Building nuclear-powered rockets would permit more crewed trips and improve the safety of astronauts, the space agency says. Shorter trips would also require less equipment and other supplies.\n\nReducing travel times will be an important part of NASA\u2019s future plans. It expects to increase the number of crewed flights as it seeks to send humans back to the moon by the mid-2020s and later to Mars.\n\nNelson said in a statement, \"With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever - a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars.\"\n\nNuclear thermal propulsion engines operate at a far higher energy density and are twice as efficient as rocket engines, officials say.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy describes on its website how a nuclear thermal propulsion system works. It needs a radioactive material like uranium and another element, such as hydrogen, in liquid form. This forms a propellant that is forced through the central part of a nuclear reactor. This causes uranium atoms to break apart inside the reactor and release heat. The heat turns the propellant into gas, which expands through an opening to produce thrust.\n\nThis kind of energy reaction, called fission, is necessary to create the extremely high temperatures needed to push heavy spacecraft during far trips.\n\nDARPA and the U.S. Department of Energy have already been jointly developing a nuclear thermal propulsion system to be used during a demonstration test flight. In 2021, DARPA awarded money to contractors General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Blue Origin to study designs of nuclear reactors and spacecraft.\n\nTabitha Dodson oversees DARPA\u2019s efforts on the test program. She told Reuters news agency that by March, the agency is expected to choose a company to build the nuclear spacecraft for the 2027 demonstration.\n\nNASA said it plans to continue studying and developing modern space nuclear technologies for other areas of the space program. This includes plans to put nuclear reactor power systems on the moon, and later Mars, to support future human space activities.\n\nI\u2019m Bryan Lynn.\n\nBryan Lynn wrote this story for VOA Learning English, based on reports from NASA, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.\n\nQuiz - NASA to Work with Military Agency on Nuclear Rocket Test Flight Start the Quiz to find out Start Quiz\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nWords in This Story\n\nthermal \u2013 adj. relating to heat\n\npropulsion \u2013 n. a force that moves something forward\n\njourney \u2013 n. a long trip\n\nmission \u2013 n. the flight of a spacecraft to perform a task or job\n\nefficient \u2013 adj. working well and not wasting time and energy\n\npropellant \u2013 n. an explosive substance of fuel that causes something to move forward\n\nthrust \u2013 n. upward push or force\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nWhat do you think of this story?

            "text": "Dead Space 2023 is Electronic Arts' modern take on the original title, launched over a decade ago. The much-anticipated remake of the sci-fi shooter classic made its way into the growing video game market on January 27, 2023.\n\nDead Space (2008) was a milestone launch for Electronic Arts: an exceptional horror-survival IP that impressed thousands of fans at its release.\n\nConsidering the franchise\u2019s erstwhile success, the popular video game publisher released a remake that promises higher graphical immersion and utilizes modern technology to provide an upscale experience.\n\nIn addition to visual, audio, and gameplay improvements, Dead Space 2023 supports ray tracing, an advanced rendering technique that can enhance the game\u2019s titular jump-scare scenes.\n\nTake a look at how you can enable ray tracing in the game.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable or disable ray tracing in Dead Space Remake (2023)\n\nFor those unaware, ray tracing is a graphical technique embedded in video games that can heavily enhance the way lighting effects are rendered. Most modern GPUs (graphic cards) support ray tracing, letting you experience advanced realism in video games.\n\nTo enable ray tracing in the game, you\u2019ll have to enable Quality Mode by following these steps:\n\nIn the in-game settings, select the Display and Graphics option. Locate the option to disable the Performance Mode. Toggle the switch to disable Performance Mode and enable Quality/Fidelity Mode.\n\nYou can then enable ray tracing in the game. To do so, follow these steps:\n\nUnder Settings > Display and Graphics, locate the option for Ambient Occlusion. To enable Ray Tracing, select RTAO (Ray-traced Ambient Occlusion) for Ambient Occlusion.\n\nSimilarly, you can disable Ambient Occlusion to disable ray tracing.\n\nAll GPUs (graphics cards) that support ray tracing\n\nNvidia RTX GPUs (20, 30, or 40 series) or AMD Radeon RX GPUs (6000, 7000 series) support ray tracing. You can also enjoy basic ray tracing with older Nvidia GPUs (GTX 10, 16 series), but GTX cards aren't powerful enough to deliver stable in-game performance with ray tracing enabled.\n\nThe Dead Space remake supports Nvidia\u2019s DLSS 2 and AMD\u2019s FSR 2, which are image-enhancing and upscaling technologies that work with compatible graphics cards to provide a better in-game visual experience. These technologies also improve the ray tracing quality and help in performance optimization.\n\nDead Space 2023 may feature some intriguing upgrades over the original game. However, fans are not happy with the game\u2019s performance optimization, especially on consoles.\n\nAs per reports, even the most advanced graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia have failed to offer a stable 60FPS experience in the game.\n\nThe situation deteriorates on consoles - the game refuses to run at 4K on the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox Series X. The resolution is capped at 1440p at 30FPS. The Xbox Series S consoles don't even support ray tracing in Dead Space 2023.\n\nRay tracing is a graphically-demanding setting, and enabling it in an inadequately-optimized game will affect your system\u2019s ability to deliver frames.\n\nEnabling the Quality/Fidelity Mode, which is required for ray tracing in Dead Space 2023, will cap the maximum FPS to 30 to increase resolution. Hence, you will have to sacrifice frames to experience ray tracing in the remake, regardless of how powerful your system is.\n\nNote: We may receive a small commission from the links included in the article.\n\nPoll : 0 votes",

            "text": "Technology can change the world in ways that are unimaginable, until they happen. Switching on an electric light would have been unimaginable for our medieval ancestors. In their childhood, our grandparents would have struggled to imagine a world connected by smartphones and the internet.\n\nSimilarly, it is hard for us to imagine the arrival of all those technologies that will fundamentally change the world we are used to.\n\nWe can remind ourselves that our own future might look very different from the world today by looking back at how rapidly technology has changed our world in the past. That\u2019s what this article is about.\n\nOne insight I take away from this long-term perspective is how unusual our time is. Technological change was extremely slow in the past\u2014the technologies that our ancestors got used to in their childhood were still central to their lives in their old age. In stark contrast to those days, we live in a time of extraordinarily fast technological change. For recent generations, it was common for technologies that were unimaginable in their youth to become common later in life.\n\nThe Long-Run Perspective on Technological Change\n\nThe big visualization offers a long-term perspective on the history of technology.1\n\nThe timeline begins at the center of the spiral. The first use of stone tools, 3.4 million years ago, marks the beginning of this history of technology.2 Each turn of the spiral then represents 200,000 years of history. It took 2.4 million years\u201412 turns of the spiral\u2014for our ancestors to control fire and use it for cooking.3\n\nTo be able to visualize the inventions in the more recent past\u2014the last 12,000 years\u2014I had to unroll the spiral. I needed more space to be able to show when agriculture, writing, and the wheel were invented. During this period, technological change was faster, but it was still relatively slow: several thousand years passed between each of these three inventions.\n\nFrom 1800 onwards, I stretched out the timeline even further to show the many major inventions that rapidly followed one after the other.\n\nThe long-term perspective that this chart provides makes it clear just how unusually fast technological change is in our time.\n\nYou can use this visualization to see how technology developed in particular domains. Follow, for example, the history of communication: from writing, to paper, to the printing press, to the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, all the way to the internet and smartphones.\n\nOr follow the rapid development of human flight. In 1903, the Wright brothers took the first flight in human history (they were in the air for less than a minute), and just 66 years later, we landed on the moon. Many people saw both within their lifetimes: the first plane and the moon landing.\n\nThis large visualization also highlights the wide range of technology\u2019s impact on our lives. It includes extraordinarily beneficial innovations, such as the vaccine that allowed humanity to eradicate smallpox, and it includes terrible innovations, like the nuclear bombs that endanger the lives of all of us.\n\nWhat will the next decades bring?\n\nThe red timeline reaches up to the present and then continues in green into the future. Many children born today, even without any further increases in life expectancy, will live well into the 22nd century.\n\nNew vaccines, progress in clean, low-carbon energy, better cancer treatments\u2014a range of future innovations could very much improve our living conditions and the environment around us. But, as I argue in a series of articles, there is one technology that could even more profoundly change our world: artificial intelligence.\n\nOne reason why artificial intelligence is such an important innovation is that intelligence is the main driver of innovation itself. This fast-paced technological change could speed up even more if it\u2019s not only driven by humanity\u2019s intelligence, but artificial intelligence too. If this happens, the change that is currently stretched out over the course of decades might happen within very brief time spans of just a year. Possibly even faster.4\n\nI think AI technology could have a fundamentally transformative impact on our world. In many ways it is already changing our world, as I documented in this companion article. As this technology is becoming more capable in the years and decades to come, it can give immense power to those who control it (and it poses the risk that it could escape our control entirely).\n\nSuch systems might seem hard to imagine today, but AI technology is advancing very fast. Many AI experts believe that there is a very real chance that human-level artificial intelligence will be developed within the next decades, as I documented in this article.\n\nTechnology Will Continue to Change the World\u2014We Should All Make Sure That It Changes It for the Better\n\nWhat is familiar to us today\u2014photography, the radio, antibiotics, the internet, or the International Space Station circling our planet\u2014was unimaginable to our ancestors just a few generations ago. If your great-great-great grandparents could spend a week with you they would be blown away by your everyday life.\n\nWhat I take away from this history is that I will likely see technologies in my lifetime that appear unimaginable to me today.\n\nIn addition to this trend towards increasingly rapid innovation, there is a second long-run trend. Technology has become increasingly powerful. While our ancestors wielded stone tools, we are building globe-spanning AI systems and technologies that can edit our genes.\n\nBecause of the immense power that technology gives those who control it, there is little that is as important as the question of which technologies get developed during our lifetimes. Therefore I think it is a mistake to leave the question about the future of technology to the technologists. Which technologies are controlled by whom is one of the most important political questions of our time, because of the enormous power that these technologies convey to those who control them.\n\nWe all should strive to gain the knowledge we need to contribute to an intelligent debate about the world we want to live in. To a large part this means gaining the knowledge, and wisdom, on the question of which technologies we want.\n\nAcknowledgements: I would like to thank my colleagues Hannah Ritchie, Bastian Herre, Natasha Ahuja, Edouard Mathieu, Daniel Bachler, Charlie Giattino, and Pablo Rosado for their helpful comments to drafts of this essay and the visualization.

            "text": "A number of organizations have formed that promote women\u2019s contributions in the technology field, with a focus on developing career paths, technical expertise, visibility within the field, and more.\n\nIn fact, at Acceleration Economy, our parent company\u2019s annual Summit North America event hosts a Women in Tech track that brings together female leaders from the Microsoft business applications ecosystem to network with other women as well as learn from empowering messages and discussions. I was privileged to play an organizing role in that gathering in the fall of 2022.\n\nSo, I was excited when I recently had the opportunity to connect with a leader from another organization helping to advance women\u2019s contributions to the technology sector: Women in Process Mining, or WIPM. This organization provides a community for women to strengthen their leadership skills, learn more about process mining, and amplify their influence.\n\nHow Women in Process Mining was Founded\n\nTowards the end of 2021, Christine Hunter, VP of Field Marketing, North America at Celonis, had the opportunity to learn about organizations designed to help women advance in technology fields. This prompted her to begin researching and identifying the need for a community to serve women in the process mining space. Celonis, a pioneer in the process mining space, is one of the Top 10 AI/Hyperautomation providers selected by Acceleration Economy\u2019s practitioner analysts.\n\nIn that process, she met Gabriela Galic, Manager, Deloitte, who had \u201cWomen in Process Mining\u201d at the top of her LinkedIn profile. When she connected with Galic, the pair realized they both had the desire to create a community specific to the process mining discipline.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, their plans started to fall into place. Hunter and Galic also connected with Natalie Wolf (Customer Success Consultant, Wolf Consulting), Dina Tzonev (Senior Manager, Celonis), and Julie Bruce (Director, Customer Value, Celonis). Together, they created the Women in Process Mining community, designing it to be a place for women in the field to magnify their influence and strengthen their leadership skills.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to lock arms all together and pave the way forward for process mining and for more generations to come.\u201d Christine Hunter, Celonis VP\n\nThe founding members knew they wanted a community, although they all had different ideas of what the community would look like. They rallied around three key areas the group would focus on:\n\nOnline community: an ongoing place where women can connect and receive content and resources for learning\n\nan ongoing place where women can connect and receive content and resources for learning Virtual and in-person gatherings: bringing women together for a more formalized structure, hosting panel discussions, and hearing from a combination of consultants and end-user customers sharing their best practices\n\nbringing women together for a more formalized structure, hosting panel discussions, and hearing from a combination of consultants and end-user customers sharing their best practices Mentorship program: a matching program through submissions on their website where members can apply to be mentors or mentees\n\n\u201cWe wanted to strengthen their leadership. We wanted to magnify their influence \u2013 the influence they already have within their organizations,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cAnd we wanted to lock arms all together and pave the way forward for process mining and for more generations to come.\u201d\n\nOvercoming Challenges in the Process Mining Industry\n\nWomen in Process Mining aims to connect female leaders who either work in the field of process mining, are studying the concepts of the technology, or doing research in the field. The organization enables the voices of women to be heard while creating a community for sharing of best practices. It provides a global network for women to learn from each other, helping to shape the future of process mining technology and the digital transformation space together.\n\nThere is much research evaluating the representation of women in tech \u2013 and how limited that representation currently is. The founders of Women in Process Mining collectively recognize that there\u2019s much room for growth. Their ongoing work is aimed at answering key questions:\n\nHow do we find a way to ensure that women know there are opportunities in this space?\n\nHow do women become educated about this technology?\n\nHow do they see other women in process mining?\n\nHow are they supported as they start their journeys within this technology landscape?\n\nPaving the Way for Future Generations\n\n\u201cI really believe that representation matters. When you see someone who looks like you in a space that maybe you have or have not been in before, or maybe didn\u2019t know that it even existed, once you see them, you start to connect the dots like, \u2018Oh maybe that\u2019s an opportunity that\u2019s available for me as well\u2019,\u201d Hunter explains.\n\nWomen in Process Mining wants to continue to build on the organization\u2019s progress to date to invite more women in so they can be representatives for future generations and feel supported once they\u2019re in this segment of the tech market.\n\nHunter emphasizes how individuals don\u2019t have to hold a background in technology to join Women in Process Mining \u2014 you just have to have an interest and willingness to learn. \u201cWhether you\u2019re on the marketing side or a content creator or video production\u2026maybe you\u2019re on the technical side or services or consulting\u2026there are so many different roles within tech.\u201d It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all journey to become involved with tech.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important for women to create change, it\u2019s also important to partner alongside allies and be a welcoming voice in the industry. The three pillars \u2014 online community, virtual and in-person gatherings, and the mentorship program \u2014 have enabled women in the process mining industry to be immersed in the community and connect with allies.\n\nFor instance, mentorship provides an opportunity for two-way learning and connection for women to grow in their careers. Mentors with more experience can reach back to help a mentee who\u2019s at an earlier stage in their career. Additionally, the organization is having conversations with various universities to bring education and mentorship around process mining to students. These connections with universities start either through personal connections that women in the community have with a university or through the Celonis Academic Alliance program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super important to get connected to larger communities for networking and growing our own personal learning,\u201d Hunter says.\n\nWomen in Process Mining at Celosphere 2022\n\nDuring Celosphere 2022, Celonis\u2019 annual customer conference that took place in November, the organization hosted a panel discussion where panelists shared their personal journeys of how they became involved with process mining as well as how they push digital transformation initiatives forward within their own organizations. They spoke about cultivating high-performance teams and how diversity, not only in people but also in thought, is critical in creating a path forward.\n\nIn fact, \u201ccreating new perspectives\u201d was a major theme at Celosphere. \u201cWhen you have a diverse set of voices or thoughts, you can bring new perspectives to the table. That\u2019s so important for continuing to innovate within a company and progress your business forward,\u201d Hunter says. Other key takeaways included discussions on how representation really matters and not being afraid to fail.\n\n2023 Outlook\n\nHunter said she\u2019s enthusiastic for another year with the Women in Process Mining community. Over the next year, they are looking forward to expanding the network globally, as they are eager to welcome more women and allies to the community.\n\nThey have plans to grow their mentorship program by hosting more networking and education events, both virtually and in person. Additionally, they will be partnering with universities as well as other end-user and customer organizations.\n\nThese expansions will enable Women in Process Mining to continue propelling its mission forward: Elevating the voices of women, magnifying their influence, and paving the way for greater leadership and representation in process mining.\n\nWhich companies are the most important vendors in AI and Hyperautomation?

They have been participants in a number of China\u2019s achievements in space including the first-ever visit to the far side of the moon and the close-up visual capture of an asteroid.The Global Times talked with the young team to find out about the stories behind these great achievements.Aged less than 35 years old on average, the members of the team are in charge of key command, design and operating positions in the tasks of flight control and spacecraft management in China\u2019s manned space projects, as well as lunar and planetary exploration missions.In the past decade, the young team has been involved in 17 major manned space spaceflight missions, four lunar probes and the country\u2019s first Mars exploration.More than 80 percent of the team are graduates from Double First-Class universities in China, and most of them have masters and PhD degrees.They share the same trait of having the mindset of always pursuing innovation, and are motivated by the firm will to explore the vast universe. They are also determined and inspired by the goals of constantly boosting China\u2019s capabilities of conducting space activities and expanding the boundaries.Yu Tianyi, a deputy director of the scientific research planning office of the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center, is part of the young team.Yu and his team have achieved multiple key technological breakthroughs in remote operating for the country\u2019s lunar rovers. Yu was the \u201cdriver\u201d for the country\u2019s Yutu-2 lunar rover and he managed to steer the rover onto the surface of the far side of the moon.Yu\u2019s team also formulated the planning and controlling system for the Yutu-2 rover\u2019s remote operation, extending the rover\u2019s service life, and making it constantly renew the world record for the longest survival time on the lunar surface.The China National Space Administration revealed that as of January 21, Yutu-2 has been operational for more than 4 years and has trekked nearly 1,500 meters on the lunar surface. China has provided more than 940 gigabytes of data to the world collected by the rover.Yu told the Global Times that the Chang\u2019e-4 lunar mission and the construction of the China Space Station were the most challenging moments in his career. \u201cAs our Chang\u2019e-4 lunar probe and Yutu-2 rover are going to new places, we are facing great uncertainties such as the landing site environment,\u201d Yu said.Yu likened the China Space Station to a \u201cgiant transformer\u201d in space, saying that such a complicated spacecraft demands perfection at every stage, which makes it difficult work for his team.Bao Shuo, another member of the team who was born in the 1990s, is the flight control center\u2019s first chief dispatcher.After the Chang\u2019e-5 probe landed on the lunar surface in December 2020, Bao was in charge of organizing all units for the key sample collecting work.Bao set the fastest earth-digging record on the moon\u2019s surface at just 37 minutes, as well as the record for sample collecting and sealing work, which was completed seven hours ahead of schedule. \u201cAs a female, I also love beauty and fashion but I like the beauty of chasing the space dream as much as the men do,\u201d Bao said.The team has worked in solidarity, achieving multiple international firsts including the world\u2019s first Lunar Lagrangian L2 point relay and detection, and a Mars mission that involved orbiting, landing and roving. They have filled in more than 50 blank spaces of space technology for China and the world.They have also shown the world the hard-working spirit of Chinese youth during the space missions.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center\n\nYu told the Global Times that it is hard to pick the most difficult moment, as the team felt it was on thin ice during each orbital launch, and each return of a manned spacecraft.\u201cMaybe the public are witnessing the normal process of missions stage after stage. In fact, behind each operation, we are standing by with numerous back-up plans in case of emergency,\u201d Yu explained.Around 4 am on October 18, 2016, the flight control center was operating missions for the Shenzhou-11 manned spaceflight mission to the Tiangong-2 space lab. All of a sudden, the center\u2019s computer detected a red alert for a potential collision with debris in space when the manned spacecraft was in its 14th lap after entering orbit, and less than 24 hours before its rendezvous and docking with the Tiangong-2.Two taikonauts on the Shenzhou-11, Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong, were close to crashing into the space debris if the flight control team had not stepped in.By 4:30 am, the team had come up with four sets of strategies to avoid a collision. After analysis by the expert panel, they decided to jump start the remote guidance control process ahead of the original schedule.According to the avoidance strategies, the orbit control team re-designed three orbit altering plans in 20 minutes.By 8:59 am, a group of control direction and data was sent out. Thirty minutes later, the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft managed to change its orbit smoothly. The red alert was then successfully cleared and later the spacecraft made a successful rendezvous and docking with the Tiangong-2.The Beijing center has staged a number of successful space rescues in recent years, including the rescue of the Yutu-2 rover as well as controlling the China Space Station to avoid colliding with space debris.Outlining new exciting chapters in major projects such as deep space exploration and manned space programs, the long-anticipated fifth edition of the China Space white paper, titled China's Space Program: A 2021 Perspective, was released at the State Council Information Office in Beijing in January 2022.It disclosed that China will, in the next five years, launch the Chang'e-6 lunar probe to collect and bring back samples from the polar regions of the moon. Chang'e-7 will perform a precise landing in the moon's polar regions, and complete research and development for Chang'e-8 key technology.Asteroid probes will also be launched to sample near-earth asteroids and to probe main-belt comets and complete key technological research on Mars. Exploration of the Jupiter system and boundary exploration of the solar system are also on the list of things to do for China's space industry in the next five years.Gao Yuhui, a senior engineer with the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, who adopted for the first time AI-powered planning technology to effectively solve the severe constraints faced by flight control tasks and flight control planning in complex lunar environments, said that he will next make plans for the country\u2019s Phase-4 lunar probe missions and manned moon landing missions.With the rapid development of China's aerospace industry, future space exploration will inevitably face more complex spacecraft systems and mission requirements. Research into safer, more reliable, more intelligent and efficient planning strategies and technical methods is an urgent task for the world's space powers, he said.The team will also strive to make breakthroughs in the fields of intelligent planning and system engineering, Gao vowed.",

The company also announced its partnership with the UK Space Agency for a study to look into nuclear power for space exploration.While the race to the moon and beyond has become crowded, space agencies and private companies are looking at ways to power future spacecraft and moonbases. NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently announced its partnership in developing a new nuclear thermal rocket engine to be used for space travel. As companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin are making headlines with advancements in space technology, Rolls-Royce is making it known that it is in the space exploration business as well.The company posted a picture of its own Micro-Reactor on its Twitter account recently. The self-contained and power-dense solution is aimed at being used either as a means for space exploration of a planetary surface or for power and propulsion of a spacecraft.Rolls-Royce stated in the tweet , \"A Rolls-Royce Micro-Reactor is designed to use an inherently safe and extremely robust fuel form. Each uranium particle is encapsulated in multiple protective layers that acts as a containment system, allowing it to withstand extreme conditions.\"Jake Thompson, Head of Innovation Products and Services at Rolls-Royce, stated, \"We're also using our nuclear expertise to design small reactors that will power bases on the moon or Mars, providing reliable and clean power for astronauts at these destinations.\"Rolls-Royce is not stopping at moonbases, however. It has entered into a partnership with the UK Space Agency to study how nuclear power can be utilized for other aspects of space exploration.Science Minister Amanda Solloway remarked, \"Nuclear power presents transformative possibilities for space exploration and this innovative study with Rolls-Royce could help to propel our next generation of astronauts into space faster and for longer, significantly increasing our knowledge of our universe.\"",

China's first commercial spacecraft launch site in Wenchang, Hainan province is being built by the Hainan International Commercial Space Launch Co., Ltd and is expected to complete work by the end of this year with normal launches planned for 2024. This new launch site will be a major contributor to China's rapidly developing commercial aerospace industry which includes hundreds of registered companies but faces challenges due to long wait times and slow return times on investments. \n2. 20 years ago, the Columbia space shuttle disaster tragically killed all seven astronauts on board and scuttled the US space programme, leading President George W. Bush to announce that it would be retired and NASA was forced to become dependent on Russia for transport until 2020 when SpaceX began flying passengers there. \n3. Vection Technologies has signed a two year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with space travel leaders to create Lunar City - the first virtual reality metaverse platform - allowing users access astronauts' training applications as well as watch live experiments from space while also broadening public outreach for Artemis program, moon landing and space tourism initiatives. \n4. NASA has tested a new propulsion technology called RDRE which could cut down fuel needed for deep space travel while providing more thrust than current systems; they are also looking into nuclear-powered spacecraft which could reduce journey time from six months to 45 days if successful . \n5. NASA has selected nine technologies worth $6 million dollars for flight testing across high-altitude balloons, aircrafts following parabolic flight profiles etc., in order to mature them for agency goals such as exploration and scientific discovery while supporting commercial industry too; next TechFlights solicitation is expected early 2023 with more information available through Flight Opportunities newsletter"
