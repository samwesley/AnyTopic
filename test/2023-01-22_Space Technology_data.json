            "text": "Netflix, Inc. NFLX shares jumped nearly 8.5% on Friday before settling at their highest level since April 19, 2022, when shares plunged after the company reported its first loss in net paid subscriber adds in a decade. Although the streaming giant delighted Wall Street with strong paid subscriber growth, earnings expectations for S&P 500 companies, in general, have tempered in the past week.\n\nHow Earnings Season Is Shaping Up:\n\nProfit Trends: Earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline 4.6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, down from the 3.9% forecast in the week ended Jan. 13, financial data provider FactSet said in its weekly \u201cEarnings Insight\u201d report. This would mark the first earnings drop since the third quarter of 2020 when profit fell 5.7%.\n\nThat said, a majority of companies reported upside surprises to both top and bottom-line expectations. About 67% of S&P 500 companies reported better-than-expected earnings per share and 64% announced above-consensus revenue, FactSet said.\n\nThe average EPS upside is 3.3%, below the 5-year average of 8.6% and the 10-year average of 6.4%. Consumer discretionary, industrial and material sectors reported the largest positive earnings surprises, while the communication services sector chimed in with the largest negative surprises. Netflix, despite its roughly in-line revenue and better-than-expected net paid adds, reported a gross EPS miss. As opposed to expectations of $0.55 per share, the company earned $0.12 per share.\n\nMargin Contraction Continues: The blended net profit margin for the S&P 500 companies is 11.4%, lower than the 11.9% reported for the third quarter and 12.4% for the year-ago quarter, FactSet said. This would mark the sixth straight quarter of sequential declines in net profit margin.\n\nThe margin contraction should not come as a surprise as consumer price inflation, although showing a deceleration, ruled high through the December quarter. The annual rate of core consumer price inflation was at 7.7% in October, 7.1% in November and 6.5% in December, according to data from the Bureau Of Labor Statistics.\n\nOutlook Muted: Out of the seven S&P 500 companies issuing EPS guidance for the first quarter, five guided EPS above consensus, while the remaining two announced below-consensus guidance.\n\nLooking ahead, 93 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results in the unfolding week, including 12 Dow Jones companies, FactSet said.\n\nSee also: Best Growth Stocks Right Now\n\nThe key earnings reports to watch out for in the new week are:\n\nMonday\n\n1. Baker Hughes Company BKR (7 a.m. EST)\n\nEPS Estimate: $0.40 Vs. $0.25 Year-Ago\n\nRevenue Estimate: $6.06 billion Vs. $5.52 billion Last Year\n\nTuesday\n\n1. General Electric Co. GE (before the market open)\n\nEPS Estimate: $1.13 Vs. $0.92 Year-Ago\n\nRevenue Estimate: $21.59 billion Vs. $23.27 billion Last Year\n\nGiven the recent spin-off of the company\u2019s healthcare business into a separate publicly traded company, investors are likely to be interested in knowing the strategic direction going forward.\n\n2. Johnson & Johnson JNJ (before the market open)\n\nEPS Estimate: $2.23 Vs. $2.13 Year-Ago\n\nRevenue Estimate: $23.95 billion Vs. $24.80 billion Last Year\n\nAhead of the quarterly results, SVB Leerink analyst David Risinger reduced his 2023 estimates, citing cautious commentary by CEO Joaquin Duato at a conference. He highlighted the accelerating Remicade erosion curve, loss of exclusivity for prostate cancer drug Zytiga in Europe as well as injectable antipsychotics and the overstated COVID-19 vaccine sales expectations for 2023 as areas of concern.\n\n3. 3M Co. MMM (before the market open)\n\nEPS Estimate: $2.36 Vs. $2.31 Year-Ago\n\nRevenue Estimate: $8.04 billion Vs. $8.61 billion Last Year\n\n4. Travelers Companies, Inc.

TSLA (after the close)\n\nEPS Estimate: $1.13 Vs. $0.85 Year-Ago\n\nRevenue Estimate: $24.16 billion Vs. $17.72 billion Last Year\n\nTesla\u2019s fourth-quarter deliveries released in early January came in below expectations, and the multiple price cuts the company announced in China, the U.S. and Europe during the quarter may have weighed on margins. Following the fourth-quarter deliveries report, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reduced his 2022 EPS estimate from $3.60 to $3.48, blaming the action on the deliveries miss, and lower ASPs and gross margin assumption. The focus now shifts to what Elon Musk and his team have to say on the earnings call.\n\n4. International Business Machines Corp.

Renee Horton (right) pictured inside an AA2 plane during a zero-gravity flight with the Zero Gravity Corporation sponsored by AstroAccess on Dec. 15. Credits: AstroAccess\n\nThree NASA employees participated in a zero-gravity flight with the Zero Gravity Corporation sponsored by AstroAccess, a project dedicated to promoting disability inclusion in space exploration.\n\nAs part of the project\u2019s second cohort of disabled ambassadors, NASA employees Denna Lambert, Dr. K. Renee Horton, and Victoria Garcia took flight on an AA2 plane on Dec. 15, from Houston.\n\nDuring the flight, the trio \u2013 along with 13 other ambassadors from a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) occupations and aerospace organizations \u2013 conducted demonstrations to test designs that seek to advance disability inclusion in space, such as tactile graphics to help both blind and sighted crew members, and a system for hearing in loud spaces that could also support hard of hearing crew members. These demonstrations build on research established with the project\u2019s inaugural flight in 2021.\n\nDenna Lambert works as the Inclusive Innovation Lead for Early Stage Innovations and Partnerships in NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate at the agency\u2019s Headquarters in Washington. She leads efforts to engage, develop, invest, and advance innovators from diverse communities that will ultimately support NASA\u2019s mission in aerospace technology.\n\n\u201cMuch like how we at NASA mature and nurture technological advances, this AstroAccess flight has a similar goal of advancing inclusion in human spaceflight,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cAstroAccess ambassadors are taking methodical and strategic steps to answer questions, adapt to barriers, and demonstrate the strength and perseverance of disabled explorers. And along the way, we are developing solutions to improve life for individuals with disabilities here on Earth.\u201d\n\nDr. K. Renee Horton serves as the airworthiness deputy for the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstrator Project at NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. Dr. Horton is a hard of hearing advocate for diversity and inclusion in STEM.\n\n\u201cI believe that if you aren\u2019t invited to the table, you build your own,\u201d said Horton. \u201cAstroAccess is showing that everyone is welcome to space, and this is our way of prepping future generations to head to space with others.\u201d\n\nVictoria Garcia currently works as a launch vehicle systems engineer at the agency\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. She is a team lead for Systems Integration in the Engineering Directorate, where her team does integration work for various NASA projects including the Space Launch System and Mars Ascent Vehicle. Victoria was born Deaf and often speaks to students about her experience working in the aerospace industry.\n\n\u201cWorking with the crew behind the scenes for AstroAccess has been a wonderful experience,\u201d said Garcia. Their mission reminds me so much of NASA\u2019s human factors work to remove barriers in space by making sure all individuals can work with technology seamlessly.\u201d\n\nNASA is proud to extend its congratulations to Victoria, Dr. Horton and Denna for lending their talents to this important project.",

            "text": "Pip Simeon (Datacom) Credit: Supplied\n\nDatacom's recently appointed associate director of strategic partnerships, Pip Simeon, is focused on creating a \"mutually beneficial\" partner ecosystem to drive ongoing success for all parties.\n\nThis includes directing efforts towards both the technology and the people behind it by leveraging industry networks and programs. Simeon took on the new role in October.\n\n\"The challenge that we see with that is on focusing these efforts for scale \u2013 we need to build on those strategic partnerships to develop both the technology and the talent pipelines,\" she said.\n\nWhile the new channel-centric role puts Simeon firmly in the technology space, a switch from marketing to sales marks a strategic shift in Simeon's career.\n\n\n\nSimeon began her career in the media space, rising up through various marketing roles before landing as group marketing manager at Fairfax Media.\n\nWhen an opportunity arose with Microsoft as commercial marketing manager in 2017, Simeon jumped at the chance to take on a challenge in a new industry.\n\nWhere Simeon\u2019s technology career really \u201clit up\u201d, she says, was in taking on a role within Microsoft\u2019s partner channel team.\n\nAs the partner marketing lead, the role was to \u201cwork extensively across the channel with partners, building out go-to-market strategies, modernising partner marketing practices and working deeply with investing in partners to grow opportunity and market potential,\u201d she said.\n\nRounding out her stint at Microsoft was landing the head of marketing role, a role that Simeon says solidified her experience with integration with B2B marketing models, \u201cunderpinned by technology and transparency around data and opportunity and insights\u201d.\n\nDeparting Microsoft to take up an opportunity as global head of marketing at Vista Group, a global film and cinema technology group and one of Microsoft\u2019s largest cloud customers in New Zealand, allowed Simeon to remain in the technology mix until her current role with Datacom arose.\n\nAs Datacom\u2019s associate director of strategic partnerships, previously held by Teresa Pollard before she departed to become chief digital officer (CDO) of Te P\u016bkenga, the role represents a pivot in Simeon\u2019s career away from the marketing space to a deepened involvement with the technology channel.\n\nReporting to Mark Hardie, director of sales and product solutions, Simeon is relishing in the opportunity to experience the technology industry in a new light.\n\n\u201cIt never ceases to amaze me that at any stage in your career, you\u2019re taking on new challenges and still on the learning journey. It\u2019s been really eye opening about the opportunity ahead, as well as being closer to the sales function of the business and closer to the customer,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her new tenure at Datacom, Simeon is focused on understanding the landscape of Datacom\u2019s partnerships in order to harness opportunities to refine its stakeholder engagement strategies.\n\nThis includes developing an overarching partnership strategy for the business to define and refine what strategic partnerships and alliances look like for Datacom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really heartened to see the desire at Datacom for change and empowerment of our partnerships and alliances \u2013 we want to grow with our partners, we want to go deeper with our partnerships, and we want to realise the power of the opportunity to work closer together with our partners\u201d she said.\n\nSimeon\u2019s marketing expertise provides a solid foundation for sales as the industry moves towards a \u201ctrue sales and marketing alignment\u201d, she said. Understanding the value proposition of what a business brings to market is what underpins strategic partnership strategies.\n\n\u201cParticularly in business to business, marketing is creating the interesting moments for customers around thought leadership and selling the art of the possibility.\u201d\n\nLike most entering a new industry, Simeon found the steep learning curve in the world of technology a challenge, but one that is constantly presenting opportunities to learn something new as well as connect with new people.\n\n\u201cThe acronyms, the language that people use, and the depth and breadth of technology solutions within this industry is phenomenal, and I constantly feel like I\u2019m on the rocket ship of learning.\u201d\n\nSimeon expresses a passion for working across the vendor landscape in the partnership space, pointing out the enthusiasm in the local channel for partnerships that are working towards a shared goal as a key point of strength for New Zealand\u2019s technology industry.\n\n\u201cDatacom has a fantastic landscape for this already, but how do we wrap around this enthusiasm to drive be able to drive that future success for the business?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been genuinely heartened by the camaraderie and the willingness to share and grow together,\" she said.\n\nGaining traction in the industry is the understanding that addressing the critical skills shortage requires hand-on solutions from key players.\n\nSimeon notes partnerships with the likes of Microsoft and AWS to work together to address the digital skills shortage by increasing the pipeline of upcoming talent to future-proof the workforce.\n\n\u201cOne of Datacom\u2019s core values is around bettering the communities that we operate in and holding people at the core of that.\"",

            "text": "Here is SpacePolicyOnline.com\u2019s list of space policy events for the week of January 22-28, 2023 and any insight we can offer about them. The House and Senate are in session this week.\n\nDuring the Week\n\nThe first space bill of the 118th Congress could pass the House this week. H.R.290, the bipartisan Commercial Remote Sensing Amendment Act is on the suspension calendar for Wednesday. Introduced by House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-OK) and Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), it\u2019s the same bill that passed the House last year as H.R. 6845 (Lucas/Perlmutter). It didn\u2019t pass the Senate, however, so has to start the process all over again.\n\nLucas said two weeks ago that passing commercial space legislation and NASA and NOAA authorization bills are his priorities as chairman.\n\nThe bill codifies a regulatory change made in 2020 to shorten from 120 days to 60 days the length of time the Department of Commerce has to make a decision on an application for a commercial remote sensing license. It also restores and expands a requirement for DOC to report to Congress annually on the status of commercial remote sensing applications, regulations and adjudications that expired in 2020. This will renew it through 2030. Bills on the suspension calendar are considered relatively non-controversial and allowed to use this expedited process that avoids getting a rule for debate from the Rules Committee \u2014 to \u201csuspend the rules\u201d \u2014 but require a two-thirds vote to pass instead of just a majority. H.R. 6845 passed last year by voice vote.\n\nThis week NASA will honor the lives of astronauts who perished in the pursuit of space exploration. The annual Day of Remembrance is on Thursday with events at several NASA centers, especially Kennedy Space Center. KSC will air its commemoration on the KSC YouTube and Facebook channels. Two days before that, on Tuesday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, and Associate Administrator Bob Cabana \u2014 all astronauts \u2014 will hold an agency-wide NASA Day of Remembrance Employee Safety Town Hall meeting that will air on NASA TV.\n\nThe Day of Remembrance is held close to the dates of the three fatal NASA missions \u2014 Apollo 1 (January 27, 1967), Space Shuttle Challenger (January 28, 1986) and Space Shuttle Columbia (February 1, 2003). This year is the 20th anniversary of the Columbia tragedy. We\u2019ll have more on that later in the week. Former NASA space shuttle program manager Wayne Hale is reposting and retweeting (@WayneHale) essays he wrote at the time of the 10th anniversary about the need to remain vigilant especially as human spaceflight operations pass to the next generation.\n\nElsewhere, AIAA\u2019s week-long Science and Technology Forum, or SciTech, starts tomorrow (Monday) at the Gaylord Convention Center in National Harbor, MD just outside Washington, DC. As usual it is chock full of interesting sessions. One of particular note is Tuesday morning when NASA\u2019s Nelson and Melroy join DARPA Director Stefanie Tompkins to talk about a new collaboration between the agencies on advanced space propulsion technologies. (Melroy was Deputy Director of the Tactical Technology Office at DARPA from 2013-2017.) NASA TV will broadcast this one SciTech session. The forum itself has a virtual option, but registration is required to listen to any others.\n\nGetting back to Monday, ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher and his division directors will hold the traditional ESA DG annual press conference at 9:00 am Central European Time (3:00 am EST). ESA has been having a number of media briefings lately, but these annual press conferences are always a good way to find out what ESA is prioritizing for the year ahead. It will be livestreamed on ESA\u2019s media channel. A recording is usually available later for those in time zones where people are sound asleep at that hour.\n\nAt the opposite end of the day, Rocket Lab will try again to launch Electron for the first time from the United States instead of New Zealand. The company has built a launch pad at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island, Virginia. (It\u2019s building another pad there for its larger rocket, Neutron, too.) The launch window is open between 6:00-8:00 pm EST. Electron will deliver three Hawkeye 360 satellites to orbit. Upper level winds didn\u2019t cooperate when they tried last month, but the weather is looking pretty good for tomorrow. NASA said yesterday it\u2019s 85 percent favorable, although today Rocket Lab called weather \u201cthe biggest watch item.\u201d Whenever it does launch, viewing should be good along most of the East Coast.\n\nOur range weather office is reporting an 85% chance of favorable conditions for Rocket Lab\u2019s first Electron launch from Wallops scheduled for Monday, Jan. 23. The main concern for our 6-8 p.m. EST launch window are high surface winds. Follow @RocketLab for more on launch day. pic.twitter.com/aArttDPHfG \u2014 NASA Wallops (@NASA_Wallops) January 21, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s launch eve! Electron is on the pad at LC-2 and the team is preparing for the final launch readiness review this afternoon. Weather is the biggest watch item, but for now we\u2019re on track for launch as planned on Jan 23 between 6-8 pm ET. https://t.co/olXThrBdxZ pic.twitter.com/sCcL7xxvWG \u2014 Rocket Lab (@RocketLab) January 22, 2023\n\nThe next NASA-sponsored Crew Dragon mission, Crew-6, is scheduled for launch on February 26 and NASA will hold two press conferences on Wednesday to preview the mission. The crew includes the first United Arab Emirates astronaut to stay for a long-duration mission, part of a deal NASA made with Axiom Space (the details of which have never been disclosed) to get Mark Vande Hei a ride on Soyuz MS-18. The UAE\u2019s Sultan AlNeyadi will join NASA\u2019s Stephen Bowen and Woody Hoburg and Roscosmos\u2019s Andrey Fedyaev. The first briefing on Wednesday at noon EST is with officials from the three space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, and the UAE Space Agency) and SpaceX. The second, at 2:00 pm EST, is with the crew. Both briefings will air on NASA TV.\n\nOn the national security front, the National Security Space Association will hold its second Defense and Intelligence Space Conference (DISC) in Chantilly, VA from Monday to Wednesday. They\u2019ve got an impressive line-up. Monday is an unclassified dinner event featuring Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. Tuesday is a day of unclassified sessions with high profile speakers including Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee; Ronald Moultrie, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security; Lt. Gen. John Shaw, Deputy Commander, U.S. Space Command; Stacey Dixon, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence; and Frank Calvelli, Air Force Assistant Secretary for Space Acquisitions and Integration. The sessions on Wednesday are classified.\n\nThose and other events we know about as of Sunday morning are shown below. Check back throughout the week for others we learn about later and add to our Calendar or changes to these.\n\nMonday, January 23\n\nMonday-Wednesday, January 23-25\n\nNSSA 2nd Defense and Intelligence Space Conference (DISC), Chantilly, VA (January 23 and 24 are unclassified, January 25 is classified)\n\nMonday-Friday, January 23-27\n\nAIAA SciTech Forum, Gaylord Convention Center, National Harbor, MD\n\nTuesday, January 24\n\nTuesday-Wednesday, January 24-25\n\nWednesday, January 25\n\nThursday, January 26\n\nNorthrop Grumman 4Q2022 Financial Results Telecon, 9:00 am ET (webcast)\n\nNASA Day of Remembrance, Kennedy Space Center, 10:00 am ET (livestreamed on KSC YouTube and Facebook channels), other events at additional NASA centers (times vary)\n\nThursday-Friday, January 26-27\n\nInteragency Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee (AAAC), NSF, 2415 Eisenhower Ave., Alexandria, VA/virtual, 9:30 am-4:00 pm ET each day\n\nFriday, January 27",

            "text": "We live in an era of renewed space exploration, where multiple agencies are planning to send astronauts to the Moon in the coming years. This will be followed in the next decade with crewed missions to Mars by NASA and China, who may be joined by other nations before long. These and other missions that will take astronauts beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and the Earth-Moon system require new technologies, ranging from life support and radiation shielding to power and propulsion. And when it comes to the latter, Nuclear Thermal and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NTP/NEP) is a top contender.\n\nThe race to space\n\nNASA and the former Soviet space program spent decades researching nuclear propulsion during the Space Race. A few years ago, NASA reignited its nuclear program for the purpose of developing bimodal nuclear propulsion \u2014 a two-part system consisting of an NTP and NEP element \u2014 that could enable transits to Mars in 100 days. As part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program for 2023, NASA selected a nuclear concept for Phase I development. This new class of bimodal nuclear propulsion system uses a \u201cwave rotor topping cycle\u201d and could reduce transit times to Mars to just 45 days.\n\nThe proposal, titled \u201cBimodal NTP/NEP with a Wave Rotor Topping Cycle,\u201d was put forward by Ryan Gosse, the Hypersonics Program Area Lead at the University of Florida and a member of the Florida Applied Research in Engineering (FLARE) team. Gosse\u2019s proposal is one of 14 selected by the NAIC this year for Phase I development, which includes a $12,500 grant to assist in maturing the technology and methods involved. Other proposals included innovative sensors, instruments, manufacturing techniques, power systems, and more.\n\nHow it works \u2014 Nuclear propulsion essentially comes down to two concepts, both of which rely on technologies that have been thoroughly tested and validated. For Nuclear-Thermal Propulsion (NTP), the cycle consists of a nuclear reactor heating liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) propellant, turning it into ionized hydrogen gas (plasma) that is then channeled through nozzles to generate thrust. Several attempts have been made to build a test this propulsion system, including Project Rover, a collaborative effort between the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) that launched in 1955.\n\nA new era for nuclear\n\nThe end of the Apollo missions had a knock-on effect on developing new modes of spaceflight. NASA\n\nIn 1959, NASA took over from the USAF, and the program entered a new phase dedicated to spaceflight applications. This eventually led to the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA), a solid-core nuclear reactor that was successfully tested. With the closing of the Apollo Era in 1973, the program\u2019s funding was drastically reduced, leading to its cancellation before any flight tests could be conducted. Meanwhile, the Soviets developed their own NTP concept (RD-0410) between 1965 and 1980 and conducted a single ground test before the program\u2019s cancellation.\n\nNuclear-Electric Propulsion (NEP), on the other hand, relies on a nuclear reactor to provide electricity to a Hall-Effect thruster (ion engine), which generates an electromagnetic field that ionizes and accelerates an inert gas (like xenon) to create thrust. Attempts to develop this technology include NASA\u2019s Nuclear Systems Initiative (NSI) Project Prometheus (2003 to 2005). Both systems have considerable advantages over conventional chemical propulsion, including a higher specific impulse (Isp) rating, fuel efficiency, and virtually unlimited energy density.\n\nWhile NEP concepts are distinguished for providing more than 10,000 seconds of I sp , meaning they can maintain thrust for close to three hours, the thrust level is quite low compared to conventional rockets and NTP. The need for an electric power source, says Gosse, also raises the issue of heat rejection in space \u2014 where thermal energy conversion is 30 to 40 percent under ideal circumstances. And while NTP NERVA designs are the preferred method for crewed missions to Mars and beyond, this method also has issues providing adequate initial and final mass fractions for high delta-v missions.\n\nThis is why proposals that include both propulsion methods (bimodal) are favored, as they would combine the advantages of both. Gosse\u2019s proposal calls for a bimodal design based on a solid core NERVA reactor that would provide a specific impulse (I sp ) of 900 seconds, twice the current performance of chemical rockets. Gosse proposed cycle also includes a pressure wave supercharger \u2014 or Wave Rotor \u2014 a technology used in internal combustion engines that harnesses the pressure waves produced by reactions to compress intake air.\n\nWhen paired with an NTP engine, the Wave Rotor would use pressure created by the reactor\u2019s heating of the LH 2 fuel to compress the reaction mass further. As Gosse promises, this will deliver thrust levels comparable to that of a NERVA-class NTP concept but with an I sp of 1400-2000 seconds. When paired with a NEP cycle, said Gosse, thrust levels are enhanced even further:\n\n\u201cCoupled with a NEP cycle, the duty cycle Isp can further be increased (1800-4000 seconds) with minimal addition of dry mass. This bimodal design enables the fast transit for manned missions (45 days to Mars) and revolutionizes the deep space exploration of our solar system.\u201d\n\nNext stop: Mars\n\nBased on conventional propulsion technology, a crewed mission to Mars could last up to three years. These missions would launch every 26 months when Earth and Mars are at their closest (aka a Mars Opposition) and would spend a minimum of six to nine months in transit. A transit of 45 days (six and a half weeks) would reduce the overall mission time to months instead of years. This would significantly reduce the major risks associated with missions to Mars, including radiation exposure, the time spent in microgravity, and related health concerns.\n\nArtist\u2019s concept of a bimodal nuclear rocket making the journey to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the Solar System. NASA\n\nIn addition to propulsion, there are proposals for new reactor designs that would provide a steady power supply for long-duration surface missions where solar and wind power are not always available. Examples include NASA\u2019s Kilopower Reactor Using Sterling Technology (KRUSTY) and the hybrid fission/fusion reactor selected for Phase I development by NASA\u2019s NAIC 2023 selection. These and other nuclear applications could someday enable crewed missions to Mars and other locations in deep space, perhaps sooner than we think!\n\nThis article was originally published on Universe Today by Matt Williams.

            "text": "Silicon Valley tech giants in the years leading up to the pandemic collected gleaming office campuses around the world as trophies for what appeared to be boundless growth. Those days of blockbuster real estate expansions appear to be over for now, however, as job cuts and profitability concerns have companies pulling back on investments.\n\nInternational tech hubs in London, Dublin, Berlin and Paris are reeling as some of the biggest companies shed office space after the pandemic forced many to reconsider their real estate needs and an economic downturn pummeled tech stocks and sparked widespread layoffs. After roughly a decade of rapid expansion, large technology firms including Google, Facebook parent company Meta, Twitter and Salesforce are offloading expensive real estate in the United States and overseas.\n\nWithin years of blockbuster leases such as LinkedIn's regional headquarters expansion at Dublin's Wilton Park development, companies are walking back their commitments to expanding their European footprints, leaving behind empty shells in high-profile cities.\n\nMeta in late 2022 is backing off plans to fill roughly 700,000 square feet of office space across London and Dublin as it scales back on its international real estate portfolio, while Google leaves at least one London office as its lease for the space nears expiration. Salesforce confirmed it was trying to sublet some of its London office tower as Amazon and Microsoft have tabled pandemic-related plans to expand in the United Kingdom.\n\nAndy Poppink, the markets CEO for JLL's business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, has lived through several Silicon Valley boom-and-bust periods, \"a bit of a cyclical retrenching\" is playing out internationally for real estate.\n\n\u201cTech companies have fallen out of favor among stock investors for the time being, and higher interest rates provide a higher hurdle from a growth and revenue standpoint,\" Poppink told CoStar News of cutbacks that echo the late 1990s' dot-com bust. \"Tech companies will then look at the bottom line and the biggest costs are labor and property. So, they pull back on hiring plans and real estate footprints.\"\n\nUnexpected Headwinds\n\nMany big tech firms benefited from a financial boost during the pandemic lockdowns when people stayed home and spent more time in front of a phone or computer screen. Companies hired aggressively to keep up with the sudden growth spurt, signing massive office deals and acquiring billions of dollars of real estate around the world that was expected to house their expanding workforces.\n\nSalesforce is trying to sublease unwanted space in its namesake tower in London's Bishopgate neighborhood. (CoStar)\n\nHowever, macroeconomic challenges and declining advertising revenue over the past year have meant companies are prioritizing profits over growth. Many Silicon Valley tech giants are now making deep cuts to their real estate portfolios by shutting down office locations, subleasing unwanted space, terminating prelease agreements and walking away from future investments.\n\nGoogle is leaving at least one of its London offices as its lease for the space nears its expiration.\n\nThrough the latter half of 2022, tech giants dumped millions of square feet of office space across European markets such as London and Dublin, much of which was never even occupied.\n\nBeyond Europe, tech real estate cuts have unfolded across the United States, pushing sublease availability and vacancy rates to record highs in top-tier markets such as New York City, San Francisco, Seattle and Silicon Valley.\n\nThe offloading has dealt an immediate blow to big tech firms' contribution to leasing volume and occupancy. In London \u2014 long considered a starting point for companies planning a European expansion \u2014 tech, media and telecommunications tenants made up their smallest share of the market in 10 years, according to data from JLL.\n\nChanging Growth Projections\n\nThe brokerage estimated that the tech sector accounted for 17% of Central London's office occupancy through 2022, accounting for roughly 1.6 million square feet. That is a steep drop from the roughly 29% share tech companies commanded in 2021, according to JLL.\n\n\"Many of the large U.S.-based global tech businesses such as Meta have accumulated large footprints in London based on significant growth in their headcount projections,\" Chris Valentine, head of JLL's central London office, told CoStar News. \"As they have entered into this more challenging economic environment, some of these growth projections are being re-visited and costs are being reviewed, leading to hiring freezes, and in some instances, rounds of\" layoffs. He added that \"where surplus real estate is identified, disposal programs have been instigated.\"\n\nIn Ireland, Facebook's parent company abandoned part of its plans for a new European headquarters shortly after signing a 25-year lease at CS Consulting Group's Fibonacci Square development in Dublin. The social media company is now trying to sublet almost 400,000 square feet of space at the project, a decision closely linked to is plans to lay off more than 11,000 workers in the city.\n\nLinkedIn has dramatically downsized plans to expand its regional headquarters in Dublin at the Wilton Park project. (IPUT)\n\nMicrosoft-owned LinkedIn was also preparing to significantly expand its European footprint in the Irish capital. By late 2022, however, the company said it was revisiting plans to expand into four office buildings at real estate developer IPUT's Wilton Park project. With most of its Irish employees continuing to work remotely, LinkedIn will instead move into only two of the buildings once the development finishes construction around 2025.\n\nThe Dublin office market had \u201cwitnessed a lot of disruption\u201d during the second half of 2022 as large tech firms cut back on space they had agreed to occupy, IPUT Chief Executive Niall Gaffney told CoStar News.\n\nAlthough he predicted a \u201cchurn\u201d of property during the first six months of 2023, Gaffney said the expansion of big tech in Dublin, albeit slightly pared back, was still a positive factor in the market.\n\n\u201cYes, we have seen some of the tech firms take steps to reduce their office space,\" he said. \"But, in the context of employment numbers within fintech and pharma sectors in this country, the level of adjustment is small. So, the moves need to be put in context, and underlying employment growth still remains positive.\"\n\nPockets of Expansion\n\nWhile the biggest names in the international tech industry are scrambling to navigate this retrenchment phase, smaller startups and lesser-known tech companies are still scooping up space.\n\nThe tech industry still accounts for about one-quarter of the office market in Ireland, according to third-quarter 2022 data from Savills Ireland, and office-based employment within the sector, or jobs that require a person commute to a physical workspace, has grown by 25% since the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nChinese social media company Tik Tok has preleased 140,000 square feet in London's Verdant development. (Topland)\n\nDeals such as those signed by Chinese social media firm TikTok \u2014 which has agreed to lease more than 220,000 square feet across two new offices in London and Dublin \u2014 underscore the sector's strength in the international commercial real estate market, even if big U.S.-based names such as Google or Meta pull back.\n\nThose tech giants and their decisions to downsize overseas may be grabbing the headlines now, but there are still plenty of homegrown and midsize tech companies willing to take on additional space, Savills' director of commercial research Clare Bailey told CoStar News.\n\nFrom fintech GoCardless and Synk, a cloud-computing cybersecurity company, in London to French startups Blablacar and Leboncoin in Paris, smaller tech companies are propping up the industry's share of international office markets with their ongoing willingness to invest in additional space.\n\nSo while big tech's role on the international real estate stage may be dimming, JLL's Valentine said, \"there are other businesses within the sector that continue to grow and expand their footprint in a meaningful way.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by CoStar journalists Paul Norman, Luke Haynes and Bert Erik ten Cate in London, and Luc-Etienne Rouillard Lafond in Paris.",

            "text": "Since its founding in 2002, SpaceX has become a significant player in space exploration, and its stock is an attractive option for investors. With the potential for lucrative returns, it\u2019s no wonder that people are asking, \u201cIs SpaceX stock a good investment?\u201d.\n\nSpaceX is a private aerospace manufacturer based in Hawthorne, California. It designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002. Musk serves as CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX has four main lines of business: Space Exploration, Satellite Communications, Research and Development, and Build-Operate-Transfer.\n\nThe company\u2019s first two lines of business are related to the exploration and production of space. The third line of business includes satellite technology research and development projects. The fourth line of business includes building and launching commercial satellites for other companies. Although SpaceX was initially focused on building rockets for government contracts, the company now conducts most of its business in the private sector.\n\nAs of May 31, 2019, SpaceX has a market cap of $33.5 billion and over $21 billion in annual revenue. Its main competitors include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin.\n\nIn this article, we will analyze the pros and cons of investing in SpaceX stock to determine if it\u2019s possible to buy it in 2023.\n\nCan you buy SpaceX stock?\n\nHave you ever dreamed of owning a piece of SpaceX? Well, unfortunately, that\u2019s not possible yet. SpaceX is a private company, meaning its shares are not publicly available and not listed in the Stock Market.\n\nThis means that you can\u2019t buy stock in SpaceX, as the company is not public, and there hasn\u2019t been an Initial Public Offering (IPO) announced yet. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be a part of SpaceX\u2019s success. Even though you can\u2019t own stock of the company, there are still ways you can join the space revolution.\n\nVirgin Galactic, Momentus, Rocket Lab USA, and Boeing are all companies involved in the space industry. These companies have a strong track record and are expected to be profitable. They could be good investment options for investors in the space industry.\n\nSpaceX technology as an investment\n\nSpaceX technology is often associated with government funding and high-profile projects like the Apollo program. While these ventures are essential, they do not provide profit to investors. SpaceX, however, is a private company that generates profit from commercial contracts.\n\nTherefore, investing in space technology is a more reliable way to make money than putting money towards government projects. Investing in space technology is an intelligent choice if you want to make a profit. Another advantage of investing in space technology is that it is an up-and-coming industry.\n\nThe space industry is expected to grow as more people use satellites for communication, weather prediction, and navigation. As this industry expands, space technology demand will increase, leading to higher profits for investors. Overall, investing in SpaceX stock is impossible as the company is still private.\n\nElon Musk and SpaceX\n\nElon Musk is the founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. In other words, he is the man behind two of the world\u2019s most successful and innovative companies. His experience in the tech and automotive industries makes him a powerful leader for both companies.\n\nThis means that he will likely continue to make good decisions for Space X, which will benefit investors. Musk has a lot on his plate as the CEO of two major companies.\n\nNevertheless, he closely monitors both companies, ensuring they remain competitive in their respective markets. This demonstrates his commitment to SpaceX and his ability to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nAs a result, SpaceX continues to grow and prosper while Musk continues to lead the company toward greater heights.\n\nSpaceX Products\n\nSpaceX has a variety of products to offer customers. These products range from satellites to spacecraft. The company also offers launch services, which allow customers to send payloads into space. SpaceX also manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which launch payloads into orbit.\n\nAdditionally, the company is working on developing a reusable rocket system to reduce space travel costs. This system is expected to revolutionize the industry and make space exploration more affordable. Finally, SpaceX is developing a satellite-based internet service to provide global internet access. This service is expected to be available shortly and will be a breakthrough for the industry.\n\nOverall, SpaceX is an innovative company that has revolutionized the space industry. The company offers a variety of products and services that are beneficial to customers and investors alike.\n\nThe company manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft for commercial and government customers. SpaceX also offers satellite services, including satellite design, building, and operation for customers. The company\u2019s flagship launch vehicle is the Falcon 9, which can launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) and Dragon capsules into orbit around Earth.\n\nThe company also manufactures and launches the Falcon Heavy, which is expected to become the most powerful operational rocket in the world once it begins commercial operations. The company also manufactures and launches the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) spaceship, which SpaceX expects to be the first reusable and crewed spaceship in history.\n\nSpace industry 2023\n\nThe space industry is expected to expand as the world becomes more reliant on satellites. By 2023, the global space industry is expected to reach $1.5 trillion in revenue. This growth will be driven by increased demand for satellite services, such as communication, navigation, and weather prediction.\n\nAdditionally, developing reusable rockets and spacecraft will reduce costs associated with space exploration and make it more accessible to companies and individuals. As a result, more people will be able to explore space, leading to further industry growth.\n\nFurthermore, developing new technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics will enable companies to explore space more efficiently and effectively. This will create even more opportunities for investors in the space industry.\n\nThis growth will likely be driven by an increase in new commercial customers and a shift in demand from government contracts to commercial contracts. The growing need to improve connectivity and provide worldwide internet access will drive demand for more satellites.\n\nIn addition, the need to monitor and manage natural resources and environments will drive demand for more satellite data. As a result, the space industry is expected to grow from $304 billion in 2018 to about $420 billion in 2023.\n\nSpaceX is well-positioned to take advantage of this growth in the space industry. The company has already established itself as a leader in the industry and has developed various products and services that are beneficial to customers. Additionally, SpaceX is developing new technologies, such as reusable rockets and satellite-based internet services, that will revolutionize the industry.\n\nAlternative stock investments to SpaceX stock\n\nVirgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE: SPCE)\n\nVirgin Galactic is a space tourism company founded by Sir Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin group of companies.

            "text": "It might sound more fiction than science, but what if you could generate solar power 24/7 by launching solar panels into space and beaming the energy back to Earth? Well, the idea just got one step closer to reality.\n\nScientists at the California Institute of Technology have successfully launched the Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD) into orbit as part of the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPP), which aims to test how the device could generate solar power while in orbit and wirelessly transmit the energy back to Earth.\n\nThe SSPD, which weighs just 50 kilograms, was fixed onto a Momentus Vigoride spacecraft that was then transported to space by a SpaceX rocket on January 3. After reaching the optimal altitude within ten minutes of launch, the Momentus spacecraft was then deployed.\n\nScientists posing with the Momentus Vigoride spacecraft. (California Institute of Technology)\n\nScientists posing with the Momentus Vigoride spacecraft. (California Institute of Technology)\n\nWhen sunlight strikes the photovoltaic (PV) cells on the SSPD, the light is converted into microwaves that travel to antennas on Earth, which convert the microwaves into electricity. The research team states that microwave transmission is safe because it is a form of non-ionizing radiation, meaning that it cannot remove an electron from an atom or molecule and cannot damage DNA.\n\n\u201cNon-ionizing radiation at the [Earth\u2019s] surface is significantly less harmful than standing in the sun,\u201d Ali Hajimiri, Caltech professor and co-director of SSPP, said in an October press release.\n\nOne of the main research objectives of the SSPD is to study how a structure measuring approximately two metres in length and width could eventually be scaled into a kilometre-scale constellation that would form the main power system.\n\nSee also: Alberta renewable energy surge could power 4,500 jobs\n\nTwo other main objectives include analyzing the performance of the microwave power transmitters and testing how 32 different types of PV cells perform in harsh space conditions over a six-month period.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the key challenges the team is evaluating are the cost of launching solar panels that are bulky and relatively heavy, as well as the need for extensive wiring to transmit energy back to Earth. To work around these hurdles, ultrathin composite materials were designed from scratch to keep the SSPD light, cost-effective, and resilient enough to withstand space travel.\n\nAn interior photo captured by a camera on the Space Solar Power Demonstrator.

There are still many risks, but having gone through the whole process has taught us valuable lessons. We believe the space experiments will provide us with plenty of additional useful information that will guide the project as we continue to move forward,\" Hajimiri said.\n\nThe research team believes that some of the main benefits of this technology are accessing the unlimited supply of solar power at a higher intensity and without interruptions, such as changing seasons or clouds.\n\nWatch below: Solar guru's TikTok making the tech more approachable\n\nClick here to view the video\n\nThe team aims to eventually launch a constellation of modular spacecraft that will produce energy for many areas around the world, especially in places that do not have access to reliable sources of electricity.\n\nDespite this sector's infancy, there are already several players that are researching and developing space-based solar power (SBSP) technologies. The federal governments in China, the United Kingdom, and the United States are in various stages of studying and developing SBSP projects. Private companies, such as Airbus, are also experimenting with beaming energy over small distances in hopes of one day scaling their projects.\n\nThumbnail image: A rendering of the Space Solar Power Demonstrator.

NASA astronaut Nicole Mann and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Koichi Wakata completed work left over from a previous spacewalk.Wakata and Mann began preparation for the spacewalk by turning on batteries inside their Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs), or spacesuits. The pair of astronauts then performed the installation of two mounting platforms as part of a planned solar array augmentation on the starboard side of the space station's truss, according to a NASA blog post.Mann and Wakata completed the work left over from a previous spacewalk on the 1B power channel, and started the installation of a mounting platform on the 1A power channel. The modification kits being installed will enable the future installation of a roll-out solar array.While the current solar arrays are functioning properly, NASA says they are beginning to show signs of degradation. In order to ensure there is sufficient power for NASA's exploration technology demonstrations for Artemis and beyond, the space agency is augmenting six of the eight existing power channels with new solar arrays. The new solar arrays will be a larger version of the Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) technology. Boeing, Spectrolab, and Deployable Space Systems (DSS) are providing the new arrays.NASA stated, \"The new solar arrays will be positioned in front of six of the current arrays, and will use the existing sun tracking, power distribution, and channelization. This approach is similar to the one used to upgrade the station's external television cameras to high definition, using the existing power and control mechanisms.\"The spacewalk , which lasted 7 hours and 21 minutes, marked the 258th spacewalk in support of space station assembly, upgrades, and maintenance. It was also the first spacewalk for both Mann and Wakata.",

It will allow students and members of the public to learn directly from those who survived this horrific event, and to reflect on how we might apply them to our world today.\n\n\u201cWe value the importance of Jewish history and its lessons on antisemitism and discrimination,\u201d said Lawrence Bell, executive director of AZJHS. \u201cIn this time of rising racism, xenophobia and antisemitism, awareness of the Holocaust is more important than ever. We must show people where this hateful rhetoric will lead and help them to be more kind, compassionate and understanding of one another. We must learn from those who survived the Holocaust, so that these kinds of atrocities can never happen again.\u201d\n\nThe new building will replace the current administration building and will feature special exhibit galleries, classrooms, a new entry way, lobby and connecting passages to existing historic sanctuary and adjacent gallery. The second floor will include administrative offices, a conference room and storage space. The basement will house archives, collections and conservation space, and potential future additional exhibition space.\n\nThere have been several donors who have been touched by the AZJHS\u2019s efforts. Arizona residents are volunteering time and financial resources to help make the education center a reality. Tim and Susie Ernst are one such couple.\n\n\u201cMy parents were both Holocaust survivors who were fortunate to have escaped at a young age,\u201d Susie Ernst explained.\n\nHer mother was 8 years old when her immediate family expedited plans and were able to leave Vienna in face of mounting antisemitic rhetoric, acts of hate and murder. Susie\u2019s father was sent by his parents to live with an aunt and uncle in the United States. The rest of his family members were arrested and killed. Both Tim and Susie\u2019s motivation to help establish the center is not only to honor the memories of those who perished, but also Righteous Gentiles who risked and often gave their lives to help those targeted by the hate and violence. A second motivation is to help educate the public as to not only the lessons of the Holocaust, but also of other crimes against humanity with the hope that all people regardless of religious, cultural or sexual preferences are treated with tolerance, respect and acceptance.\n\nHoward Atlas says that he found out about the project by chance after seeing a television segment in the news, but his motivation to help comes from a deeper place. Atlas\u2019s father came to the United States with his sister and mother in 1938. Prior to their escape, his grandfather left Hungary for the United States to get a head start to make money for when the rest of the family was able to leave. His grandmother had a feeling that things were going to get worse and borrowed just enough money take a ship to America with her two children. Just weeks later, Hungary\u2019s borders closed.\n\nStu Siefer is a retired architect from Tempe. While volunteering his design services, he met local Holocaust artist Bob Sutz and Holocaust survivor Oskar Knoblauch. Sutz, who lost many family members in the Holocaust, spent the last 40 years making plaster life masks of Holocaust survivors and liberators and painting scenes of their horrific experiences in the death camps. Knoblauch spent many years visiting schools throughout Arizona to share his experiences living through the Holocaust and teaching young people the importance of standing up to hate and bigotry. Siefer was so inspired by the dedication and commitment of these two men that he decided to help pursue their dream of building a place in Phoenix where the lessons of the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity could be taught especially to young people.\n\nThe generous contributions that have been made to the Capital Campaign from donors so far has brought AZJHS over 50% to their goal to date.\n\nWith planned funding goals achieved, the expectation is that final space and technological plans, blueprints, construction drawings and city permits will be accomplished in 2023, city agencies\u2019 approvals and ground breaking mid-2024, and grand opening in 2025.",

In this Scholar-Athlete Spotlight, we are featuring Panther women\u2019s basketball player Farah Shaaban, a sophomore who is majoring in Aerospace Engineering.\n\nA transfer from St. Louis Community College after growing up in Cairo, Egypt, Shaaban has played in all 14 games this season after playing in 11 games in 2021-22.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2021-22 season, Farah was named to the Sunshine State Conference Commissioner\u2019s and Florida Tech Athletic Director\u2019s Honor Roll.\n\nWe talked with Farah about how she handles the demands of her major and her sport as well as what sparked her desire for a career with planes.\n\n\u25a0 What\u2019s your major at Florida Tech and why did you choose this? Is it something that you\u2019ve always wanted to do?\n\nI\u2019m majoring in aerospace engineering, and I\u2019ve practically wanted to do this since I was maybe eight. I\u2019ve always had a really big interest in planes and making models and all that, so I was overjoyed when I got accepted here.\n\n\u25a0 What was it about Florida Tech that drew you here?\n\nFirst off, with Coach Reynolds, it just went super good, and then like I said, Florida Tech, aerospace engineering, it can\u2019t get better than that. The beach is a plus, so everything just kind of lined up.\n\n\u25a0 How do you plan to use your degree after graduation?\n\nAfter graduating, I\u2019m planning to work for a little bit, and then I want to come back, finish my master\u2019s, probably in-flight testing, and then, hopefully, test flights.\n\n\u25a0 What are some of the exciting projects that you\u2019ve been able to work on in classes here?\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve worked on a helicopter rotor head, I had to design that all by myself in Creo, so that was really nice. I also had to design a menzi mug for solids modeling, which was also really cool.\n\nI really like the designing part of my major and that\u2019s hopefully what I plan on doing.\n\n\u25a0 Your season runs from early November through the end of February with a lot of practices and road trips in between, how do you keep everything balanced once the season starts?\n\nIt does kind of get overwhelming at times but just stay on top of everything, planning my day ahead of time.\n\nI know what I\u2019m doing the next day before I go to bed. So, just having everything in my calendar and booking times for food, things like that.\n\nHow has being a collegiate athlete prepared you for what you\u2019re doing now and what do you take from the court that you apply to your studies?\n\nBasketball has definitely taught me a lot. Especially leadership, communication, all that translates into the junior design, senior design, and all that in my studies, but also the community and how to interact with other people and how to treat other people, that came from basketball.\n\n\u25a0 What advice would you give to an athlete coming to Florida Tech that has an interest in Aerospace Engineering?\n\nUm, I would say take advantage of all the resources that you have at Florida Tech. All the clubs, all the professors, get to know your professors, talk to them, go to their office hours and they will keep you on track.\n\n\u25a0 What have you enjoyed the most about your time at Florida Tech and with the women\u2019s basketball program?\n\nThe trips to Tampa last year and this year, they\u2019re always fun. We went to the movies this last trip. It\u2019s always a good time with the team honestly.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR BREVARD COUNTY NEWS",

NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nTake the golf-cart-sized twin rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on the red planet in 2004.\n\nBoth rovers measure just over five feet tall and exceeded their expected lifetimes of 90 days exploring and gathering data on the Mars' surface.\n\nLike most modern rovers, the twins have a camera mast that looks like a neck.\n\n\"It really looks like a face, and that's on purpose from a scientific perspective,\" Freeman said. \"We have two cameras that are spaced about the same space as the eyes.\"\n\nRovers also have robotic arms designed to work as a human geologist would.\n\n\"We're living vicariously through through these robotic explorers,\" Emily Stough, an engineer for NASA's Insight lander, told Insider. \"It's kind of like friends go on a great adventure and they take all these great pictures and you get to follow along from home.\"\n\nTheir ability to snap selfies on the Martian surface make them seem self-aware\n\nNASA's Curiosity Mars rover created this selfie in front of Mont Mercou. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nRovers are able to use the camera attached to their robotic arm to take epic selfies from the Martian surface.\n\n\"There's a certain self-awareness behind taking a selfie, and I think we can translate this to the rover,\" Katie Stack Morgan, deputy project scientist of the Mars 2020 rover, told Insider.\n\n\"Of course, we're the ones telling it to do that.\"\n\nPerseverance rotates its robotic arm. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\n\"What always struck me about the selfies is that like, how just a subtle tilt of the mast can kind of convey a different human emotion compared to a head-on, straight-on view,\" she added.\n\nRobot 'personalities' emerge by tackling challenges on Mars\n\nAs a mission with a six-wheeled rover ages, the robot's \"personality\" emerges.\n\nSpirit and Opportunity were two rovers that were totally identical in their design. But based on the different places where the rovers landed on Mars, they ended up having two very different experiences.\n\n\"Spirit got this personality where it was sort of a blue-collar worker, really down in the dirt grinding away. It needed to do a lot harder work,\" Freeman said.\n\nOpportunity, meanwhile, was known as \"Little Miss Perfect\" after it landed on top of geological evidence of liquid water.\n\nFull-scale models of three generations of Mars rovers, with Sojourner rover (center), the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers (left), and Curiosity (right) NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThen there's Curiosity, a car-sized rover that landed on Mars in 2012. Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lovingly started calling it George, according to Stack Morgan, who also served as a geologist for the Curiosity rover mission.\n\nThe resilient robot has had to overcome several issues throughout its mission.\n\n\"You get this feeling that the rover is tackling challenges, and those become very human actions,\" Stack Morgan said. \"Through the ups and downs of operating a spacecraft is when you really start to build that emotional connection \u2014 you really start to see them as a friend and partner who's struggling along with you. We're doing the Earth side of it and the rovers are doing the Mars side of it.\"\n\nNot all mission team members embrace this level of attributing human characteristics to a literal robot.\n\n\"For some people, the anthropomorphizing is going too far, because it would take away from the pressure to really care for the robot,\" Vertosi, the sociologist, said.\n\nThe public can engage with first-person accounts on social media\n\n\"Scientists do have a way of interacting with the rovers that really brings them to life. But it's not quite the same as the public,\" Vertesi said. \"NASA has really encouraged that because, you know, public engagement is incredibly important for publicly funded science. I think that's why we see so much of this encouragement of anthropomorphism among the public.\"\n\nThis started with LiveJournal entries for Spirit and Opportunity, ascribing them each their own personalities. Now, most NASA missions now have their own social media accounts written in the first-person.\n\nRovers, landers, and orbiters can even send heartbreaking farewell messages, thanks to their dedicated social media team.\n\nIt's hard to say goodbye to a friend\n\nFor the teams of hundreds engineers and scientists who work on Mars spacecraft, the end of a mission means the loss of a core team member.\n\n\"It's also the loss of a team that you have worked very hard and very intensively with for decades,\" Vertesi said, adding that she's been involved in several \"robot funerals.\"\n\nOn February 12, 2019, mission controllers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, sent the last commands to ask NASA\u2019s Opportunity rover on Mars to call home. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nTo bid farewell to NASA's plucky Opportunity rover in 2018, mission staff at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory decided to play Billie Holiday's \"I'll Be Seeing You.\"\n\n\"It's like a wake,\" Vertesi said. \"It's a celebration of life and the last hurrah for the team, as much as it is a way of grieving for and processing the loss of the robot for which they have intensively cared and dedicated so much of their lives to.\"",
