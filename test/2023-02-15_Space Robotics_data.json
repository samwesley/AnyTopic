            "text": "Farming automation management startup SwarmFarm Robotics has raised $12 million in a Series A to address agriculture\u2019s worker shortage.\n\nThe round was led by Canadian agtech fund Emmertech, from Conexus Venture Capital, supported by Brisbane VC Tribe Global Ventures and South Australia\u2019s Access Capital. Existing investors Tenacious Ventures and GrainInnovate, the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) VC fund, also chipped in one more.\n\nSwarmFarm was founded near Emerald, Queensland, in 2015 by Andrew and Joice Bate, to produce intelligent robotics for agriculture using what\u2019s known as integrated autonomy to save farmers time, resources, costs and energy.\n\nThe company is looking to expand internationally with the funds, as well as adding to teams at its NSW and Queensland offices.\n\nAndrew Bate, the startup\u2019s CEO, said that the SwarmBot platform and operating system network, SwarmConnect, is a new approach to on-farm autonomy designed to unlocks the potential of driverless technology via an open platform where developers to create new applications for farmers.\n\nThink of it as the robotics marketplace for other agtech startups, which also connects them to build better autonomy.\n\n\u201cThere is enormous demand for autonomy in agriculture, but today, most solutions unlock minimal potential,\u201d Bate said.\n\n\u201cThe current equipment providers believe that farmers just want to be plucked from the cab or replaced by robotic arms. We believe that farmers want more. They want a technology ecosystem built to address the issues in their locality, a farm-centric system that leaves the lowest possible footprint on their fields, helping them do more with less. They want integrated autonomy, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nBate said that while there\u2019s no shortage of driverless tractors and niche agriculture robotics solutions, they operate in their own silos creating new levels of work and supervision for farmers.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is a third category of autonomy that combines the robot and the application within a development framework that will allow farmers to customize their equipment for their needs and allow developers to bring their innovations to life much more rapidly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best of both worlds. For the farmer, we provide customised autonomy in a box. For the developer, we provide a streamlined path to the grower with a tight feedback loop.\u201d\n\nThe idea emerged on his family farm in response to his own concerns around excessive chemical use and the need to acquire larger acquiring equipment to deliver economies of scale\n\n\u201cWe hit a point where we just said enough is enough,\u201d Bate said.\n\n\u201cWe saw our input costs increasing, our equipment costs rising as we bought larger equipment, our dependence on pesticides rising, and our yields declining despite it all. There was a day when we sat down and realised that this wasn\u2019t an equation that needed incremental change; we needed an entirely new farming system \u2013 and SwarmFarm was the solution.\u201d\n\nSwarmFarm\u2019s platforms are now used on 5.3 million hectares of commercial land, over 64,000 hours of operation. As a result, pesticide inputs delivered via autonomous robots have fallen by an estimated 780 tons.\n\nThe future of agriculture\n\nEmmertech MD Sean O\u2019Connor said the SwarmFarm team are pioneering the future of autonomous agriculture.\n\n\u201cThe key trait that drove our eagerness to lead this round was the farmer-centric approach this team is built around and the truly exceptional results their robots have achieved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe met with several farmers who were putting upwards of 3,000 hours a year on their SwarmBot, often leaving them out in the fields for over 24 hours at a time. We believe there\u2019s a future where SwarmBots can be found on farms across North America and worldwide.\u201d\n\nGRDC head of business development Fernando Felquer said: \u201cWhat makes SwarmFarm so attractive to us is that the founders are Australian grain growers developing autonomous solutions from the ground up with Australian farming systems in mind, and the technology has global application.\u201d\n\nBate said his focus is on facilitating collaboration between farmers and technologists.\n\n\u201cWe envision a future where the most promising minds in technology are encouraged to turn toward solving the challenges faced by modern agriculture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe future of agriculture is happening now, but there is no way that one company can really invent everything needed to revolutionise agriculture. We need the smartest minds from around the world working on this.\n\n\u201cWe need an army of developers solving agriculture\u2019s problems one app at a time. So come join us as a partner and help deliver the revolution that agriculture needs.\u201d\n\nMore on SwarmFarm here.",

            "text": "Figure 1: Stanley Robotics robot head with car loaded on platform. Thomson actuators rotate plier arms to grip tires that keep cars from sliding off the platform while in motion.\n\nBefore a newly manufactured car is delivered to a dealership, it typically joins thousands of others in a large storage lot where it can sit for days or even months. Managing these lots requires many manual, time-intensive tasks: attendants must start each car, park it safely in a designated area, keep track of its location and be able to access it easily for distribution when needed. Vehicle remarketers, airports, auto rental services and many other businesses that require high-volume auto storage and easy retrieval share these same issues. Ultimately, manual auto parking results in inefficient space and labor utilization, risk of accident and injury to attendants, and burning of fuel.\n\nFrance-based Stanley Robotics, a leading provider of automobile storage logistics robots, hopes to change all that, offering a self-guided, vehicle-carrying platform that finds a car, lifts it, moves it gently, and parks it in an allocated space. When the robot arrives at the car, light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors detect its position, the position of the wheels, and the distance between them, and slides the platform underneath. Once the car is aligned on the platform, electric linear actuators from Thomson Industries, Inc., help to secure the vehicle on the platform and lift it (Figure 1). Thomson\n\n\n\nConverting to Electric\n\nWhen Stanley Robotics created its first-generation robot in 2015, engineers used hydraulic cylinders to move the platform\u2019s two arms, or pliers, into place. Hydraulics exhibited several drawbacks, however, leading them to explore electric actuators for their next-generation product.\n\n\u201cThere were leaks with hydraulics; they were high maintenance,\u201d said Thomas Ravasi, Senior Mechanical Engineer at Stanley Robotics. \u201cTheir high load capacity was an advantage, but they are slower than electric actuators and needed additional components such as hoses and pumps. They are also much harder to integrate inside a robot than electric actuators. Hydraulic systems also consume more energy, which is important because we run on battery power and need to translate as much of that into motion as possible.\u201d\n\nStanley Robotics selected Thomson Electrak HD electric linear actuators (Figure 2) based on extensive performance benchmarking against competitors, integration testing on 3D CAD design systems and numerous calculations. Based on this analysis, Stanley Robotics concluded that the Thomson electric actuators would meet their requirements for securing the car on the platform, lifting, intelligence, weather resistance and energy consumption.\n\nThomson\n\n\n\nSecuring the Car While in Motion\n\nBefore lifting the vehicle, it must be secured onto the platform. Stanley Robotics accomplishes this with pliers that close in under each tire. When the robot first slides the platform under the car, all pliers except the two closest to the robot head are retracted so that the platform can clear the width of the wheels (Figure 3).\n\n\n\nThomson\n\n\n\nThe two pliers closest to the front wheels never move and thus are not actuated. Once the robot senses that the front wheels are in contact with the fixed pliers, the actuators extend the two pliers in the adjustable rear part and move them backwards until they contact the front of the rear wheels (Figure 4). Once it confirms the pliers are in contact with the fronts of all the tires, the robot signals the actuator to rotate the remaining four pliers to grip all of the wheels. For this critical function, Stanley Robotics uses six Electrak HD actuators.\n\nThomson\n\n\u201cWhen we lift the car, all its weight rests on the pliers, and the load puts pressure on the actuator within the platform, which tries to close the pliers inside the platform,\u201d said Stanley Robotics Head of Robot Engineering Eric Cabrol. \u201cThe high static load capacity of electric actuators, however, enables them to operate like a brake to keep the load in the right position.\n\n\u201cWe use the capacity of the actuator to stop on its own. The software asks the actuator to open the pliers as much as possible and as they contact the wheels, the actuator increases the grip until it reaches its maximum capacity and stops automatically. Our embedded software tracks all of this by monitoring current consumption and sensing the angle of the pliers. If the angle is open enough when the current exceeds a designated setpoint, the system assumes that the tire grasp is adequate.\u201d\n\nOnce the wheels are locked in place, two Electrak HD actuators raise the platform roughly five inches off the ground.\n\nA Smarter Solution\n\nElectrak HD actuators feature onboard electronics, which enable them to participate in programmed sequences and communicate information with other actuators and devices.\n\n\u201cWe developed the software that we embed in the system,\u201d said Cabrol. \u201cIntegrating this with our sensor architecture enables us to compute the motions that need to be done and tells the actuators what to do. Our PC sends messages through Ethernet, then Ethernet signal CAN converters relay those messages to the actuators. The Thomson smart actuators provide all this capability plus exact feedback on their position along their stroke. With a hydraulic actuator, we would have to add that.\u201d\n\nBattling the Elements\n\nThomson Electrak HD actuators can operate in temperatures ranging from -40\u00b0C (-40\u00b0F) to +85\u00b0C (185\u00b0F). The high end of the temperature range is especially important because much of the robot\u2019s activity is performed on blacktop, which absorbs heat. Cabrol said they have recorded temperatures up to 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F).\n\n\u201cThe Electrak HD\u2019s IP rating is very attractive,\u201d said Cabrol. \u201cWe have seen instances in which the robot platforms were completely submerged. Although, we would never run them while submerged, of course, we do want them to return fully operational when the water goes down.\u201d\n\nAll Charged Up\n\nThomson actuators\u2019 ball screw technology is very energy efficient. Operators can move more cars on a single charge with electric actuators rather than with hydraulics. \u201cBecause the electric actuators do not need to be running all the time, we lose less battery power that way,\u201d said Cabrol. But at the same time, he says that some lots run the robots 24/7, and the battery efficiency helps there as well.\n\nSpeed and Operational Efficiency\n\nMost high-volume parking lots impact their operators\u2019 bottom line, so the faster the actuators can help park more cars in less space, the more valuable they are to the lot owners and managers. Electric actuators offer additional advantages in this regard because they enable multiple actuators to operate simultaneously, instead of in sequence, as most hydraulic solutions would.\n\n\u201cOur robots can improve space utilization in most storage parks by up to 50 percent,\u201d said Cabrol. \u201cWe can park vehicles closer together because we don\u2019t have to open the doors. We can simplify access lanes because our software knows exactly where each vehicle is and when it needs to get in and out.

            "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Increase in investments in space robotics, rising demand for satellite launches, and the surge in the number of joint ventures by major players to broaden their business and geographic reach across the world drive the growth of the global space robotics market.\n\nAllied_Market_Research_Logo\n\nAllied Market Research published a report, titled, \"Space Robotics Market by Solution (Remotely Operated Vehicles, Remote Manipulator System, Software, Services), by Application (Deep Space, Near Space, Ground), by End User (Commercial, Government): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2031\" According to the report, the space robotics industry generated $4.3 billion in 2021 and is estimated to reach $8 billion by 2031, witnessing a CAGR of 6.9% from 2022 to 2031. The report offers a detailed analysis of changing market trends, top segments, key investment pockets, value chains, regional landscapes, and competitive scenarios.\n\nDownload Free Sample Report - https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7530\n\nDrivers, Restraints, and Opportunities-\n\nIncrease in investments in space robotics, rising demand for satellite launches, and the surge in the number of Joint ventures by major players to broaden their business and geographic reach across the world drive the growth of the global space robotics market. On the other hand, high costs associated with space exploration missions restrain the market growth to some extent. However, technological advancements in the space industry and the use of software-defined technology in space robots are expected to create lucrative opportunities in the industry.\n\nCovid-19 scenario-\n\nDue to the measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19, the growth of global space robotics companies was disrupted in 2020. The restrictions imposed by governments led to disruptions in research and innovation initiatives, which are often the first to experience disruptions during economic downturns.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the space robotics industry has managed to stay afloat and even explore new opportunities. This is due to the increasing demand for various space-related applications during this time, which has kept many space robotics initiatives in motion.\n\nThe services segment to maintain its dominance during the forecast period-\n\nBy solution, the services segment held the highest share in 2021, holding more than two-fifths of the global space robotics market revenue, and is projected to maintain its dominance by 2031. The rising number of space test missions introduced in outer space and earth orbits along with a growing number of space programs by developed and developing regions drive the growth of the segment. The remotely operated vehicles segment, on the other hand, would showcase the fastest CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. This is due to their ability to operate without real-time assistance from ground control throughout their operation.\n\nInterested to Procure the Research Report? Inquire Before Buying - https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/7530\n\nThe near space segment to rule the roost-\n\nBy application, the near space segment accounted for nearly three-fifths of the global space robotics market revenue in 2021 and is projected to rule the roost by 2031. The growing need for continuous servicing & maintenance of active satellites, inflowing government investments, and increasing number of space research & exploration projects across the world are the factors driving the growth of the segment. The ground segment, on the other hand, display the fastest CAGR of 9.6% throughout the forecast period. The rising R&D activities have boosted the demand for space robots in ground applications, thus driving the segment growth.\n\nThe commercial segment held the lion's share in 2021\n\nBy end-user, the commercial segment has garnered the major share in 2021, generating more than two-thirds of the global space robotics market revenue, and is anticipated to grow by 2031. This is because the growing number of threats in military security have been ultimately fostering the need for satellite communication services as a part of ensuring reconnaissance, surveillance, and intelligence application areas. The government segment, on the other hand, would display the fastest CAGR of 9.0 % throughout the forecast period. This is attributed to the fact that government projects have recently covered most of the headlines and public sector activity has also increased significantly. For example, NASA announced the launch of the first-ever manned mission to the International Space Station in 2020 using a commercial rocket after the UK's shuttle program was terminated in 2011. This marks a significant turning point in the government's cooperation with businesses in the field of space, helping the market for space robotics to expand with the government as its primary beneficiary.\n\nNorth America held the major share in 2021\n\nBy region, North America accounted for the highest share in 2021, holding nearly three-fifths of the global space robotics market revenue. To cater to the rising demand for commercial purposes, hundreds of new satellites are expected to be launched in near future. Also, the governing relaxation on the sale of high-end satellite images for commercial uses is one of such measures that has offered lucrative opportunities for the market growth across North America. LAMEA, simultaneously, would portray the fastest CAGR of 12.1% from 2022 to 2031.\n\nLeading Market Players-\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation,\n\nhoneybee robotics,\n\nOceaneering International, Inc.,\n\nAstrobotic Technology,\n\nOlis Robotics,\n\nspace applications services nv/sa,\n\nispace inc.,\n\nAltius Space Machines,\n\nMaxar Technologies,\n\nmotiv space systems, inc.\n\nThe report analyzes these key players in the global space robotics market.

            "text": "European skywatchers were stunned at a fireball entering Earth's atmosphere on February 13. Multiple video angles were captured from various locations.\n\nKrisztian Sarneczky, an asteroid hunter working at the Konkoly Observatory in Budapest, Hungary, discovered the asteroid only hours before it began its descent to Earth. According to reports, Sarneczky forwarded the appropriate information to the European Space Agency (ESA), which determined the asteroid measured 3.2 feet wide and was called SAR 2667. Sarneczky explained to Space.com that the small space rock was discovered during a routine Near-Earth Object (NEO) check.\n\nThe asteroid plummeted to Earth at 10 p.m. EST on February 12 (0300 GMT February 13), and there have been at least 61 sightings of its bright entry. From the above and below video footage captured by skywatchers, the space rock can be seen growing in brightness, completely lighting up the sky for a brief moment before disappearing into the darkness. The American Meteor Society confirmed the reports from residents, which spanned across England, Netherlands, Belgium, and France.\n\n\"I discovered this small body during a routine NEO [near Earth object] hunt. It was immediately obvious that it was an NEO, but it wasn't particularly fast across the sky, as it was heading right towards us, and it was faint,\" wrote Sarneczky to Space.com.\n\nIt should be noted the fireball event seen across Europe coincidentally fell almost 10 years to the day as the fireball that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, on February 15, 2013. However, the Chelyabinsk fireball was much larger than SAR 2667, measuring approximately 59 feet in diameter.\n\nThe Chelyabinsk asteroid exploded in Earth's atmosphere as it got closer to the surface, releasing the energy equivalent of around 440,000 tons of TNT, which generated a shock wave that blew out windows over 200 square miles. The explosion injured 1,600 people, which were mostly injured by broken glass, and damaged more than 7,200 buildings.\n\nSimilar to the SAR 2667 event, there was hardly any warning with the Chelyabinsk asteroid. Following the Chelyabinsk event, many entities, such as NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and various governments, began to take asteroid searching much more seriously. In response to the Chelyabinsk event in the following years, NASA opened the Planetary Defense Coordination Office, a department responsible for providing timely and accurate information to the government, the media, and the public on close approaches to Earth.\n\nWhile NEO tracking efforts around the world have certainly amped up, there are still many improvements that can be made. NASA has previously stated that it has already discovered any asteroids with the potential to cause an Extinction Level Event (ELE) for the next 100 years. However, the space agency believes it needs to look further into space and perform orbital predictions on objects that may not necessarily be an immediate threat to Earth but may turn into a very serious threat in the future.",

            "summary": "On February 13, European skywatchers were stunned by a fireball entering Earth's atmosphere. The 3.2 foot wide asteroid was discovered only hours before its descent to Earth and multiple video angles were captured from various locations across England, Netherlands, Belgium, and France. This event is similar to the Chelyabinsk asteroid explosion of 2013 which caused significant damage in Russia with hardly any warning beforehand. In response to this event and others like it, NASA has opened the Planetary Defense Coordination Office in order to provide timely information on close approaches to Earth and continue searching for asteroids that may pose a threat in the future."
