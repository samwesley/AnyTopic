It\u2019s a version of the junk people put on their faces and bellies on TikTok to make them look like stick figures. Thankfully, that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nAlthough the app is focused on making you look weird for now, the team wants to expand into actual health and fitness. Once you filter yourself to oblivion, the app attempts to help you reach your visual goals. It will eventually offer personalized training programs and progress tracking to help individuals take control of their health and well-being.\n\nStartup Strategies is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribed\n\n\u201cWe are spending our current funding on product development and releasing new features within the app,\u201d said Urban. \u201cWe\u2019re currently working on improving transformed photo realism, workout progress photo logging, and adjustable work plans based on fitness goals.\u201d\n\nUrban sees his app as a way to motivate us to look and feel better.\n\n\u201cAn image of a person with a transformed physique, featuring their goal [appearance], is a key motivator to encourage them to exercise, eat well, and maintain a healthy sleep schedule. Upon seeing this photo, they release endorphins or \u2018feel-good\u2019 hormones. This can fuel their desire to make positive long-term lifestyle changes, such as avoiding fast food and joining a gym,\u201d he said.\n\nThey also claim that seeing yourself ripped as John Cena will make you more confident. The jury is still out on that.\n\nSo it\u2019s an app that fat-shames you into working out by showing you what you\u2019d look like if only you ate kale smoothies and creatine. It\u2019s definitely interesting.\n\n\u201cUltimately, our app aims to empower individuals to take control of their own health and well-being,\u201d said Urban.\n\nFair enough. I just worry that folks who try this app will slap their instant \u201cafter\u201d photo on Instagram and keep living their chocolate eclair-filled lives. But, as a certified fatty, that might be the eclairs talking.",

            "text": "Chatbots have been around since the 1960s, when programs were created to simulate conversation. However, it wasn\u2019t until the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning that they became what they are today. Now, the technology has matured, and it is seeing use in a variety of ways, including marketing.\n\n\u201cBy integrating chatbots into your workflow, you can optimize time-consuming and unprofitable tasks so that human employees can dedicate their efforts to more meaningful and financially rewarding activities,\u201d says Rudy Mawer, \u201cAI and chatbot technology has advanced to such a degree that it\u2019s nearly indistinguishable from communicating with an actual human.\u201d\n\nChatbots Meet Customer Needs\n\nThe digital age has ushered in numerous innovations, but it has also led to just as many expectations. One expectation held by many customers today is the ability to do things whenever they want \u2014 without delay. That includes looking up information, making purchases, and receiving support.\n\nHowever, those expectations are not always met, and when a business falls short, customers will often start looking for alternatives on the spot. Because of that, businesses that do not offer a 24/7 channel of communication to meet customer expectations risk losing to a competitor that does.\n\nIt is particularly difficult for businesses to meet those needs when they require human labor, which was the case for a long time with customer service and support.\n\nCustomer Service and Support\n\nChatbots can easily handle customer service and support, answering common customer service questions and freeing up human representatives to focus on complex tasks.\n\nThey can also provide instant support and resolve issues, leading to improved customer satisfaction. Moreover, they are only getting better, to the point they can hold a conversation and perform some of the more complex tasks themselves.\n\nLead Generation and Qualification\n\nLead generation is a vital part of any business, especially when it comes to growing and expanding a customer base. It uses a number of tactics and channels to create a pool of qualified leads, including things like email marketing, social media advertising, and SEO.\n\nChatbots can help with the process by gathering information about potential customers and qualifying them as leads. It usually involves the chatbots asking questions and collecting information to find out whether a potential customer is interested and whether they will be a good fit for the company.\n\nPersonalized Marketing\n\nPersonalization is a major part of any marketing tactic today. People want to feel special, and one way to do that is to present them with what they like. Chatbots help make that possible by gathering information and using it to personalize their interactions with customers.\n\nAn example is a chatbot making a personalized product recommendation based on a customer\u2019s previous purchases, interests, or behavior. The approach leads to increased engagement and sales, and it can be used in multiple ways.\n\nEvent Promotion\n\nChatbots are growing more capable, which makes it possible to hand over promotion and management of events like webinars and trade shows. They lack the flexibility of humans, but they are incredibly capable when it comes to providing information, answering questions, and taking care of registration.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nContent is perhaps the most important part of any marketing campaign, whether it be a few well-crafted words or an engaging video. Chatbots help marketers get the most out of their efforts, doing things like delivering daily newsletters or giving interested users more information about a particular piece of content.\n\nE-commerce\n\nChatbots can be integrated with e-commerce platforms to assist customers, making the shopping experience smooth by providing whatever help is needed at the time. That includes:\n\nHelping customers find products\n\nPlacing orders\n\nTracking shipments\n\nAnswering questions\n\nProviding recommendations\n\nIf the shopping experience is not smooth, many customers will go elsewhere or stop shopping altogether. The same is true if a customer does not feel confident in their purchase, which is why having chatbots to handle any concerns at any time can be so valuable.\n\nSurveys and Feedback\n\nGathering feedback and conducting surveys can be tedious, but it is an important part of figuring out which marketing efforts are working and which are not. Using conversational language and interactive questions, chatbots can make surveys more engaging and increase participation rates.\n\nSocial Media Management\n\nSocial media is a massive part of any business these days, so much so that some companies are completely moving their company from websites to social platforms. There are also more and more people turning to social media to find out more about a company and get customer support.\n\nIntegrating chatbots with social media platforms will allow them to assist with community management. Much the way they are used as support on a website, they can be programmed to respond to comments and messages, providing quick and efficient support and feedback.",

The company\u2019s shares have retreated 5.2% so far this year.\n\n\u201cThe business environment in India continues to be pretty challenging,\u201d Malhotra said. \u201cThe next quarter is also going to be pretty tough, so we don\u2019t see inflation actually getting tame \u2014 but next year going forward things will become a little better.\u201d\n\nFollow Startup Story",

            "text": "Dry cleaning is not only costly for consumers, it's costly to the environment as well. Toxic chemicals can disperse into the air and remain on clothing. Its heavy use of plastics around each cleaned garment, as well as transportation of clothes to and from the cleaning facilities, contribute to global warming through carbon emissions.\n\nWhile some industrial dry cleaners are opting for greener chemicals, others are looking to change the whole business model.\n\nPresso is an Atlanta-based startup that invented what looks like a vending machine for dry cleaning, but its process is a little different.\n\n\"We actually invented an entirely new clothing care process from scratch with compostable organic cleaning liquid that we synthesize in our own office with our own engineers, as well as new ways to stretch and press clothes,\" said Presso CEO Nishant Jain.\n\nFirst, the user positions a piece of clothing in the Presso machine and then enters information about its fabric and size. The process, however, takes only a few minutes and can cost up to 80% less than traditional dry cleaning, depending on the garment.\n\nAlong the way, it consumes seven times less water and three times less electricity than traditional laundry and dry-cleaning services, according to the company. It also eliminates transportation to a cleaning facility. And all that reduces the carbon footprint of the clothing care by 93%, it added.\n\n\"There are no hangers that are disposable, there's no disposable plastic bags. None of the process of even doing logistics inside a dry cleaning facility, none of that exists anymore,\" said Jain.\n\nPresso now has machines in a few boutique hotels and apartment buildings, but it is making a push into the big hotel brands, like IHG. It has machines now at two Holiday Inns and plans to expand to more IHG properties.\n\nHoliday Inn Express franchise owner Dipan Patel said the guest response has been very positive. \"Once we get the service to a point where our guests are educated and people are comfortable using the services, I don't see a reason why it won't be in every hotel in the country,\" Patel said.\n\nPresso doesn't have a lot of competition in the industrial space, but it hopes to bring these machines to consumers at home. There is already some competition in that market, but Jain likens it to the microwave, which moved quickly from restaurants and industrial use to become one of the most popular home appliances.\n\n\"In the next five years we expect to be nationwide and start looking into scaling internationally,\" he added.\n\nPresso is backed by Uncork Capital, Cherubic Ventures, 1517 Fund, AME Cloud Ventures, SOSV's Hax and Pathbreaker Ventures. It has so far raised just under $10 million in funding.\n\nCNBC producer Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this piece.",

We intuitively understand the reputational risks associated with investments in sextech. After all, it has much to do with sexual health and well-being being placed under taboo in societies around the world. Even so, the tide may be turning.\n\nWhen Lisbon-based sexual wellness startup Pleasy Play won the CEE-based Wolves Summit pitch contest in 2021, it marked the first win by a sextech company in the competition. The jury of venture capital professionals and big tech companies chose the innovative app aimed to help couples build intimacy over startups in the sphere of education or enterprise marketing.\n\nThe signs don\u2019t stop here. In the US, huge market and financing success and financing deals and company exists from intimate wellness brands such as Hims & Hers or contraception companies such as The Pill Club and sex toy companies such as Dame, point to a maturing market.\n\nIn Europe and Israel, too, investors are starting to see market opportunities for sextech startups. Crowdfunding platforms such as UK-based Crowdcube are open to sextech startups, and funds such as Israeli-based Intimate Capital have launched to invest into the sexual wellness market. Despite increased activity, only close to \u20ac260M has been invested in the European sextech market in the past two years, according to Dealroom. Given that the global sexual wellness market is expected to hit $120 billion by 2030, there is a lot of potential still untapped.\n\nWith that in mind, we put together a list of sextech startups from Central and Eastern European roots, which are offering innovative sexual health and wellness products and services.\n\nHeadquarters: New York City, US, with Bulgarian founder\n\nTeam: Dimo Trifonov, Ana Kirova\n\nCategory: Dating\n\nAbout: Feeld is a dating app where you can date as a single or as a couple and meet like-minded humans.\n\nLatest: So far, the company has raised a total funding of over $500K from angel investors.
