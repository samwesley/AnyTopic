Venturini Motorsports has won six consecutive races at Daytona, five on the 2.5-mile tri-oval and one on the road course with drivers Michael Self, Harrison Burton, and Corey Heim. \u2022 It\u2019s the third time VMS has led the pre-race practice results with a female driver (Natalie Decker, Leilani Munter)\n\n\u2022 Breidinger\u2019s fastest lap was 49.119 seconds/183.228 miles per hour, just 0.007 seconds quicker than Balcaen.\n\nLove, a two-time ARCA Menards Series West champion, led the full-time drivers in third place, timing in at 49.129 seconds/183.191 miles per hour.

These jumbo prawns are served with the heads on and are definitely the most eye-catching part of the dish.\n\nThey are complemented well by a delicious citrus vinaigrette that\u2019s not outright tart but definitely brings a slightly sweet and sour note to cut through the richness of the shrimp. In addition to the massive showpiece prawns, there are several smaller bay shrimp mixed throughout the salad to keep the theme going.\n\nThe salad itself is fine. It\u2019s mixed greens with arugula, and it works well with the dressing.\n\nThe dressing provides a through-line of flavor but doesn\u2019t necessarily bring the whole dish together. The salad is good with the dressing, and the shrimp is good with the dressing, but the salad and the shrimp never really come together. It\u2019s a bite of each at a time. Whereas something like a Cobb salad, which is made up of many disparate ingredients, comes together as a singular, unified dish when it\u2019s done right. This one just seems to be a collection of ingredients on a plate that are neighbors more than partners. That being said, it\u2019s a delicious entry from an already great restaurant, and we would expect nothing less from Pym Test Kitchen.\n\nRead our review of the Pym Test Kitchen breakfast.\n\nFor more Disneyland Resort news and info, follow Disneyland News Today on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

            "text": "Eddie Nketiah's 90th-minute winner sealed a dramatic 3-2 win against Manchester United as Arsenal took a huge step towards winning the club's first Premier League title since 2004.\n\n- Premier League: Standings | Schedule | Statistics\n\nIn a pulsating game at the Emirates, both sides traded the lead before Lisandro Martinez's equaliser in the second half for United appeared to send the clash towards a draw. But Nketiah, who cancelled out Marcus Rashford's opener with a first-half header, claimed victory for Arsenal in the final minute to keep the Gunners five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table.\n\nHere are some quick thoughts about Sunday's standout Premier League fixture.\n\nJUMP TO: Best/worst performers | Highlights and notable moments | Postmatch quotes | Key stats | Upcoming fixtures\n\nRapid reaction\n\n1. Arsenal pass another huge test in their title charge\n\nJanuary was supposed to be the acid test of Arsenal's surprise challenge for the Premier League title, but Mikel Arteta's team keep on proving the doubters wrong with big results, and none will be more significant than this 3-2 win against Manchester United.\n\nThe Gunners were held by Newcastle at the start of the month, but won at Tottenham last week before avenging their only defeat of the season so far against United. And in beating United, Arsenal displayed the qualities of champions. They fought back from conceding an early goal, went on to take the lead and then scored a late winner after the visitors had made it 2-2 midway through the second half.\n\nArsenal have yet to play champions Manchester City this season, so the clash against a resurgent United was the biggest test of Arteta's team. And they answered all the questions asked of them to beat Erik ten Hag's side.\n\nNketiah scored twice as Arsenal shrugged off a 1-0 deficit to come out 3-2 winners in a gripping game at the Emirates. Mark Leech/Offside/Offside via Getty Images\n\nArsenal are now at the halfway stage of the season and have amassed 50 points from 19 games. Even if they drop off from that incredible pace in the second half of the season, they will still finish the campaign with a huge points total; the pressure is on City to reel them in, but this Arsenal side is playing without fear and nerves.\n\nBoth may come, of course, but right now they are showing the same kind of carefree form that propelled Leicester to the title in 2016. And unless City can beat them in their first league meeting next month, it will become increasingly difficult to see how anyone can stop Arsenal from winning the title.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\n2. Weghorst makes a difference, but United still lack attacking edge\n\nWout Weghorst is not the answer to Manchester United's goal-scoring problems, but he is certainly giving Erik ten Hag's team something different up front. The Netherlands international, on loan from Burnley until the end of the season, has been brought in to bolster United's attacking options following Cristiano Ronaldo's mutually-agreed departure in November.\n\nWith Anthony Martial still sidelined with a hamstring injury, the 6-foot-6 Weghorst started his second successive game at the Emirates and, just as on his debut at Crystal Palace, he didn't threaten the opposition goal. But Weghorst has made United more direct and given them the option to hit the ball long when needed. It would be wrong to suggest that he is merely a target man, though.\n\nWeghorst is good with his feet and he linked played well with his attacking teammates and also drew players to mark him whenever the ball was in the air, freeing space for the likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony. He also has a much greater work ethic than Martial and is prepared to endlessly press the opposition defence. But ultimately, he is limited in his ability to beat his marker and opponents know that they can keep Weghorst at bay fairly easily.\n\nUnited have the lowest goal tally in the top six and right now, they're being rescued by Rashford's goals time and time again. That won't continue forever, so they need to be more potent. Weghorst gives them another option, but he won't score enough goals to make United serious title contenders.\n\nWeghorst certainly adds something to the United attack, but he'll need to start contributing goals to take some pressure off Rashford. James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images\n\n3. Arsenal have a right-back problem\n\nMikel Arteta has worked wonders to turn Arsenal into title challengers, but his team still has flaws, and nowhere more than at right-back.\n\nBen White was awful in the first half and completely failed to make life difficult for Rashford. He was also outdone more than once by Bruno Fernandes as United repeatedly attacked down their left-hand side.\n\nThe former Brighton defender is primarily a centre-half, but he has operated at right-back throughout this season because Gabriel and William Saliba have been so impressive in the middle of the Arsenal defence. White is simply not equipped to play at right-back. He thinks like a centre-back and it means he often makes the wrong decisions.\n\nArteta substituted White at half-time -- it may have been an injury, but there was no indication of that -- and replaced him with Takehiro Tomiyasu, but the Japan defender was no better than his teammate and arguably even worse.\n\nObviously, being asked to defend against Rashford in this kind of form is tough for any player, but there are other great wide players in the Premier League and Arsenal will face them during the battle for the title.\n\nTo avoid their clear weakness being targeted, Arteta needs to find a solution -- and fast.\n\nRashford, middle, was superb in the first half down Man United's left side. Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images\n\nBest and worst performers\n\nBEST\n\nEddie Nketiah, FW, Arsenal: He's proving to be much more than merely a stand-in for the injured Gabriel Jesus. Great goal to equalise in the first-half and was in the right place at the right time to score the winner.\n\nLisandro Martinez, DF, Man United: Rejected a move to Arsenal to sign for United last summer and Erik ten Hag will be delighted with the Argentina defender's performances. This was one of his best, with a goal too.\n\nBukayo Saka, FW, Arsenal: Scored an outstanding goal and then hit the post when trying to do the same again. United had no answer to the Arsenal winger.\n\nWORST\n\nBen White, DF, Arsenal: The Arsenal right-back was turned inside and out by Rashford and lacked conviction in too many challenges. A real weak-link in the Gunners' team.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka, DF, Man United: Lost Nketiah at the far post for Arsenal's equaliser and unreliable when he had possession. Like White with Arsenal, Wan Bissaka just wasn't up to the job.\n\nAntony, FW, Man United: Another game without any kind of positive impact by United's \u00a385 million summer signing. All left foot and not quick enough to go past his defender ... what does he actually do?\n\nHighlights and notable moments\n\nRashford's sparkling form must be noted, especially as he opened the scoring on Sunday with a brilliant, thundering effort from distance to beat Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nHowever, after a brilliant back-and-forth game, up stepped Nketiah with the decisive moment in the 90th minute.\n\nAfter the match: What the players/managers said\n\n\"It was a great game with a lot of tempo and the audience is the big winner. Two top teams, but of course we are disappointed when you lose this game at a late stage. All the goals we conceded today are mistakes: it can't happen. Even last week, we were so hard to beat in such situations. Today we were not. All three goals, we could have avoided.\n\n\"They are very good on the ball, but we are a good defending team. There were not a lot of open chances. We made mistakes which we cannot make. This game was decided by small details but also the decision making. That is hard to accept and we have to learn from it... I want to win. It is not good enough. We want to be the number one but not if we make mistakes. That is clear and what I told them.\" -- Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag speaking to BBC Sport\n\n\"Emotional, a lot of passion. It doesn't get much better than that. The second half especially, the performance was incredible. We were composed and determined at the same time. We never panicked. We always believed that we could win it. We showed the right composure in the box a lot of times but the ball didn't go in. Thankfully at the end it did.\n\n\"It's great and we deserve where we are because of how we're playing. But there are a lot of things that we can do much better.\" -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports\n\nKey stats (provided by ESPN Stats & Information research)\n\nArsenal: Restores 5-point lead over Manchester City in Premier League standings; 63% chance to win Premier League per FiveThirtyEight's Soccer Power Index\n\nArsenal: 50 points through 19 PL games are the 5th most by a club at this stage of a Premier League season\n\nArsenal: Extends PL unbeaten streak to 13 games (11-0-2 W-L-D), its longest Premier League unbeaten run since 14, from Aug.-Dec. 2018\n\nEddie Nketiah: Seven goals in last seven appearances in all competitions after scoring two goals in his first 18 games this season\n\nMarcus Rashford: Nine goals in nine games in all competitions since the post-WC restart; that is more than he scored in 19 games pre-World Cup (8) for Manchester United this season; Rashford's 9 post-restart goals in all competitions are the most among players in Europe's top 5 leagues\n\nBukayo Saka: Scored in 3 straight Premier League games vs. Man United, joins Arsenal legends Freddie Ljungberg (1998-2000) & Thierry Henry (2000-01) as the only Arsenal players to score in 3 straight PL apps vs Man United.\n\nUp next\n\nArsenal: It doesn't get any easier for the Gunners after Sunday's hard-fought win. First they face a trip to Manchester City on Friday for an FA Cup fourth-round clash, followed by struggling Everton away on Feb. 4 in the Premier League.\n\nManchester United: Thanks to United's progress in the Carabao Cup, they face a busy fortnight of games in several competitions. After a Wednesday visit to Nottingham Forest (Carabao Cup semifinal, first leg), they host Reading (FA Cup, fourth round) on Jan. 28 before the return leg of their semifinal with Forest on Feb. 1. From there, just a couple of days' rest before their next league clash, a home game vs. Crystal Palace, on Feb. 4. It's exhausting to type, let alone play in.",

He's getting the job done, he certainly doesn't look like he's (100) percent,\" seven-times Grand Slam champion John McEnroe told Eurosport.\n\nAsked if De Minaur could cause issues for Djokovic's injured hamstring, McEnroe said: \"De Minaur is someone potentially (who could do that) because he relies on speed and grit and making an opponent work.\n\n\"The type of guy that could cause Novak problems if he's not 100 percent.\"\n\nBefore Djokovic takes on De Minaur, fifth seed Andrey Rublev will play Danish teenager Holger Rune as the Russian bids to reach the quarter-finals at the season-opening major for the second time in three years.\n\nRublev, 25, believes ninth seed Rune will not be the underdog in their contest, with the Dane a dark horse at the tournament following his Paris Masters final victory over Djokovic in November.\n\nIn the other matches, Spanish 24th seed Roberto Bautista Agut will face American Tommy Paul looking to equal his best result in Melbourne, having reached the quarter-finals in 2019, while Ben Shelton will play J.J. Wolf in an all-American clash.\n\nShelton will be competing in the last 16 of a Grand Slam for the first time in his career -- a remarkable achievement for the 20-year-old who a year ago was No. 569 in the ATP Rankings and still in college.\n\nIn the women's draw, last year's WTA Finals champion Caroline Garcia will bid for her maiden last-eight berth at the tournament when she comes up against Magda Linette, the last remaining Pole after Iga Swiatek and Hubert Hurkacz exited.\n\nBig-hitting Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka, seeded fifth, will aim to stretch her undefeated start to the season against Swiss 12th seed Belinda Bencic, who is also in solid form with a seven-match winning streak.\n\nCzech 17-year-old Linda Fruhvirtova, the youngest woman left in the draw, will play Croatian Donna Vekic for a place in the quarter-finals as she looks to maintain her fairytale run, while former world number one Karolina Pliskova takes on Zhang Shuai.\n\nReporting by Manasi Pathak in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

(2005) argue that it\u2019s partly because it feels more painful to get an answer wrong because you changed it than wrong because you didn\u2019t change it.\n\nSo we tend to remember much more clearly the times when we changed from right to wrong.\n\nAnd so when taking a test we anticipate the regret we will feel and convince ourselves that our first instinct is probably right (when it\u2019s probably not).\n\n.",

The RBA forecast that inflation peaked at about 8 per cent in December.\n\nTrimmed-mean inflation \u2013 the RBA\u2019s preferred measure that excludes large price movements \u2013 is projected to be 6.4 per cent, up from 6.1 per cent in the September quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fourth-quarter inflation data will be a critical input into the RBA board\u2019s February deliberations,\u201d said Felicity Emmett, senior economist at ANZ. \u201cIt would take a solid downside surprise in underlying measures of inflation for the [RBA] to consider a pause in hiking.\u201d\n\nInterbank futures imply about an 82 per cent probability that Australia\u2019s central bank will lift interest rates next month, and an 18 per cent chance it will keep the cash rate on hold at 3.1 per cent.\n\nTraders expect the cash rate will peak at around 3.54 per cent in September, down from 3.9 per cent last week ahead of weak jobs figures.\n\nPotential pause\n\nAMP\u2019s chief economist, Shane Oliver, says the RBA has tightened enough to bring inflation back to target, and it should leave the cash rate on hold next month to avoid the risk of unnecessarily tipping the economy into recession.\n\n\u201cThe monthly jobs and inflation data are consistent with the RBA pausing,\u201d Dr Oliver said. \u201cBut the strength of retail sales as indicated by the ABS for November and from corporate reports suggests a still high risk of another 0.25 percentage point hike in February.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s consumer price index for the December quarter will be released on Wednesday.\n\nWestpac forecast that inflation rose by 1.1 per cent in the three months to December, causing the annual rate to slip to 6.9 per cent, from 7.2 per cent in the September quarter.\n\nThe bank predicted that inflation won\u2019t be back within the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\u2019s target band until mid-2023.\n\n\u201cThat will keep the pressure on the RBNZ to continue hiking the cash rate for some time yet,\u201d said Satish Ranchhod, senior economist at Westpac.\n\nEarnings test\n\nIn the US, the December-quarter reporting season will begin to ramp up, with companies comprising more than half the S & P 500\u2019s market value due to report results in the next fortnight.\n\nThis includes Microsoft, the second-largest US company by market value, reporting on Tuesday (US time), Tesla and IBM on Wednesday and Intel on Thursday. Apple, the largest US company, and Alphabet are scheduled to report in the following week.\n\nConsensus expectations point to a 2.5 per cent decline in corporate earnings compared to a year ago.\n\nOf the 11 per cent of S & P 500 companies to have reported so far, only 69 per cent have beaten expectations which is well below the norm of 76 per cent, according to AMP.",

            "text": "As the world accelerates the transition to greening its transportation network, nearly every manufacturer is jumping on the bandwagon. This is especially true in China through domestic market models such as the $5,000 Wuling Mini EV, the joint venture between MG-owner SAIC and General Motors that has sold more than 500,000 cars in just three years and outsells Tesla on a monthly basis.\n\nHowever, some legacy manufacturers in the region are far behind and falling further back every day. The only way to stand out in the crowd is to be unique, often through collaborations with other local Chinese brands. DJI, the commercial drone company, recently teamed up with Baojun (also SAIC/GM-owned) to make the Kiwi mini EV, featuring their self-driving tech and festooned with DJI logos across its doors.\n\nSo brands like Honda that have been relatively slow to transition to electric propulsion globally, and with very few EV models in production, have decided to gatecrash the electric moped market through a collaboration with Japanese lifestyle brand Muji.\n\nOn the surface, this is a dream partnership through two of Japan\u2019s most loved brands, pairing Honda\u2019s engineering prowess with the simple aesthetics of Muji. The result of this collaboration is the Sundiro Honda x Muji MS01 electric moped, and on paper it should be perfect. Yet it\u2019s only being sold in China through a limited production run of just 5,000 units.\n\nBetter Late Than Never\n\nHonda has been building bikes since 1949. It\u2019s where the company started\u2014by attaching 500 leftover engines to bicycle frames with quality and smart engineering at the core. It followed with smash hits like the Honda Super Cub, which had sold over 100 million mopeds globally by 2017, but has lagged in recent years against Chinese electric moped brands like NIU and Ninebot, which are dominating the global market with cheaper, mass-produced models complete with connectivity to mobile apps and large communities of users.\n\nHonda seems to have thought that rather than competing with the tech features of their rivals, they can bring some pure Japanese design aesthetic to the table by working with Muji. The now-international brand, which began as a product line of the supermarket chain Seiyu in 1980, is well recognized in China, with more than 240 stores in the country, and its DNA of \u201ccreating simple, low-cost, good quality products\u201d resonates with Chinese consumers.",

Few drivers would try to make such a trip in a single day with a gas-powered car, yet Lukey seems disappointed that it took two long days to make it all the way.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to build support for electric vehicles when publications like the Globe keep tearing them down.\n\nRather than examining how many people actually want and can afford to make such treks, she says that her inability to do so means that \u201cEVs still are primarily for people who want, and can afford, both a \u2018home\u2019 car and an \u2018away\u2019 car.\u201d To her credit, Lukey largely blames the lack of charging-station infrastructure and concludes that the government needs to invest more to make EVs more accessible. However, this thoughtful conclusion is largely overshadowed by a headline that blames the cars rather than the infrastructure.\n\nGet Today in Opinion Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nI fear that readers will conclude that EVs are not worth their time rather than that we need to pressure our elected officials to do much more to make an electrified future a reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIan Evans\n\nBrighton\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you take off, tank up on app research\n\nJoan Lukey writes that \u201cyou need a smartphone app to find the non-Tesla charging stations\u201d if you go on a road trip.\n\nWell, yes. What\u2019s hard about that?\n\nThere are multiple apps, such as A Better Routeplanner (ABRP) and PlugShare, both cited in a recent Globe article. The EVHotels app shows hotels with Level 2 chargers, where you can recharge overnight, often at no cost. (Know any hotels that will give you a free tank of gas?) And Tesla says it will make its network of more than 7,000 Level 3 fast chargers available to other makes, though that will require an adapter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew trips exceed the range of a typical EV. But when you need recharging on a road trip, a combination of built-in technology and related apps can get you there, Lukey\u2019s glass-half-empty narrative notwithstanding.\n\nMichael A. Sandman\n\nBrookline\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla set the path. Now other carmakers need to do more to build out charger network.\n\nJoan Lukey writes about her experience driving a new Kia EV and discovering that charging a non-Tesla electric vehicle is hard given the dearth of Combined Charging System, or CCS, chargers along her 1,000-mile route. Her proposed solution, however, is to force Tesla to open its chargers to all vehicles rather than force the other EV manufacturers to invest in a charging network.\n\nTesla invested in those charging stations to make its cars easier to live with, while the major auto manufacturers scoffed at Tesla as an upstart that would never succeed. Kia could direct a portion of its revenues to building out some chargers. The only other major auto company to have built chargers is Volkswagen, as part of its settlement over its diesel emissions scandal.\n\nIn the meantime, Lukey should repeat the trip in a Tesla and write a rebuttal of her previous experience.\n\nHenry J.

            "text": "Two years ago, Minnesotans who carried thin strips of paper for detecting whether street drugs contain fentanyl could be arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nNow, those paper strips \u2014 no more than a few inches long \u2014 have emerged as a vital tool in the state's fight to prevent opioid overdoses, which continue to claim hundreds of lives in Minnesota each year.\n\nNonprofit community groups and health clinics have given away more than 100,000 of the fentanyl test strips since Minnesota legalized them in July 2021.\n\nThe strips are already changing user behavior: The vast majority of people who discover fentanyl in their drugs using the strips have taken steps to reduce the risks of a deadly overdose, according to surveys by Minnesota providers.\n\nThe Steve Rummler Hope Network, the state's largest provider of free fentanyl test kits, has surveyed 722 people who have used the strips since October 2021. Of these, 90% said they changed their behavior to reduce overdose risk. Some 31% of respondents said they decided not to use the drug, while 23% chose to increase safety by using in a group or with another person. Others said they took smaller doses or slowed their drug intake, according to the participant survey.\n\nThose findings are consistent with a smaller survey by NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center in north Minneapolis, which found that 89% of test strip users took overdose-prevention measures once they discovered fentanyl.\n\n\"Fentanyl test strips are gold,\" said Dr. Charles Reznikoff, an addiction medicine doctor with Hennepin Healthcare, who hands out the strips to many of his patients. \"It not only saves lives, it serves as a reminder to the person that fentanyl may be present in whatever drug they may be using and is deadly.\"\n\nA surge in fatal overdoses has heightened the urgency of efforts to distribute the test strips.\n\nIn 2021, overdose fatalities reached 1,286 \u2014 up 22% from the previous year and the highest in at least the past decade. Through an analysis of death certificates, the Minnesota Department of Health found that fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin \u2014 was involved in 90% of all deaths linked to opioid use that year. Because it is cheap, potent and plentiful, fentanyl is being mixed into a growing number of opioids to produce a stronger high.\n\nThe fentanyl test strips are part of a broader approach known as harm reduction, which seeks to give people tools to reduce their risk of dying or contracting infectious disease rather than emphasizing abstinence.\n\nThe paper strips work much like over-the-counter pregnancy tests. Each strip is dipped into a small amount of water containing a bit of drug residue. After a couple of minutes, either one or two red lines appear on the strip. One line means the liquid contains fentanyl; two lines means the test did not detect the drug. The strips can detect fentanyl in all types of drugs, including heroin, cocaine and counterfeit pain pills, and in different forms (pills, powder, and injectables).\n\n\"One reason the fentanyl test strips are so useful is there is a full-tilt industry of producing fentanyl, and right now it's humming,\" Reznikoff said. \"There's a ton of [fentanyl], and that's why it keeps being put in all these different [drugs] and keeps killing people.\"\n\nOn a blizzardy morning, Gabe Lyrek, a harm reduction specialist, demonstrated how the strips work from the NorthPoint's harm reduction and testing services center in north Minneapolis, which provides the strips and other tools free of charge.\n\nSlowly, Lyrek poured a tiny amount of sterile water from a test kit into an aluminum cup, sometimes called a \"cooker\" by drug users. Then he sprinkled in a sample of vitamin C powder \u2014 no more than the diameter of a pencil \u2014 into the cup and stirred it carefully. He then dipped the wavy end of the paper test strip into the mixture and waited 15 seconds before removing it. Within two minutes, the paper showed two pink lines \u2014 a negative result \u2014 confirming that fentanyl was not in the sample.\n\nLyrek and his team at NorthPoint have handed out more than 2,700 of the test strips since they were decriminalized \u2014 the most of any on-site location in the state.\n\n\"Once you know there's fentanyl in [the sample], then you can make an informed decision,\" Lyrek explained. \"You can use slower. You can use less. You can dilute your drugs more. But there are always other options once you find out \u2026 that can prevent you from overdosing.\"\n\nStaff at the NorthPoint harm reduction and testing services center are reminded daily of the high stakes of their efforts to educate users about the benefits of the test strips and other harm-reduction tools such as sterile syringes.\n\nAbout two months ago, a woman overdosed and was no longer breathing in a church parking lot adjacent to the center at 710 W. Broadway. When she was discovered by security guards, Lyrek and others rushed outside to help. It took mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and five doses of Narcan, a drug that reverses the effects of opioids, to revive the woman.\n\n\"It's scary, because every time someone walks in here, that might be the last time you see that person,\" Lyrek said. \"That's why we really try to develop relationships with people and let them know we care.\"\n\nThe need for fentanyl test kits has become so intense that it's now possible to buy them through Amazon.com and have them delivered to one's doorstep. While harm reduction specialists praise the growing availability of the strips, they encourage one-on-one visits to clinics and testing centers where they are available. Every time a fentanyl test kit is handed out, clinicians say, is another opportunity to talk to users about the deadly risks of fentanyl and ways to avoid overdosing.\n\n\"Out of everything that we provide here, the most important thing of all is the fact that we care about you,\" Lyrek said. \"You don't know our name. We don't know your name. But the second you walk in that door, you have somebody who cares whether you live or die.\"\n\nStaff writer Kim Hyatt contributed to this report.",

Surveys conducted by Minnesota providers show that those who used these strips changed their behavior to reduce the risk of a deadly overdose; 90% said they decided not to use the drug or used it in a safer manner while 23% chose to take smaller doses or slowed their drug intake. The need for these kits has become so great that they can now be purchased on Amazon and with every kit handed out by clinicians, there is an opportunity to teach users about how dangerous fentanyl is and ways to avoid overdosing."

That\u2019s what you might have thought if you watched his straight-set win over Ugo Humbert on Saturday. Rune was holding his wrist and gingerly moving his foot\u2014even as he was running away with the second set. Afterward, he said he was able to play \u201cfull\u201d\u2014100 percent\u2014but his physical status will be something to watch going forward.\n\nJudging by the form of his next opponent, Rune will need to have every bit of good health he can muster. After losing his first two matches of 2023, Rublev, the fifth seed, has been dominant in Melbourne. He was in total control in a straight-set win over 25th seed Dan Evans on Saturday.\n\nStill, it\u2019s Rune who comes into this match having not dropped a set, and despite being just 19, he also comes in with a 1-0 record against his higher-ranked opponent. While Rublev is the more relentless ball-striker, Rune can match him physically, and do more with the ball from different parts of the court. He\u2019s the younger player, but he sounds like a man who considers himself the favorite.\n\n\u201cWe played each other last year in Paris,\u201d Rune said of Rublev. \u201cI was still believing that I could beat him, and I did beat him. He\u2019s a super tough opponent. He\u2019s obviously playing well here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll expecting a tough match, but really looking forward to it.\u201d Winner: Rune",

            "text": "FRIDAY, Jan. 20, 2023 (HealthDay News) \u2014 Among an average-risk population, follow-up colonoscopy (FU-CY) rates are low after a positive noninvasive stool-based screening test (SBT) for colorectal cancer, according to a study published online Jan. 18 in JAMA Network Open.\n\nJeff T. Mohl, Ph.D., from the American Medical Group Association in Alexandria, Virginia, and colleagues conducted a mixed-methods study including a retrospective analysis of deidentified administrative claims and electronic health records data between June 1, 2015, and June 30, 2021, as well as interviews with clinicians from five health care organizations to assess FU-CY rates after a positive SBT result. The cohort study included 32,769 individuals (mean age, 63.1 years).\n\nThe researchers found that the FU-CY rates were 43.3, 51.4, and 56.1 percent within 90, 180, and 360 days, respectively, of the positive SBT result. When interviewed, clinicians were uniformly surprised by the low FU-CY rates. There was variation observed in rates by race, ethnicity, insurance type, presence of comorbidities, and type of SBT used. The strongest positive association was seen with multitarget stool DNA use (hazard ratio, 1.63 relative to fecal immunochemical tests), and the strongest negative association was seen with the presence of comorbidities (hazard ratio, 0.64 for a Charlson Comorbidity Index >4 versus 0).\n\n\u201cAt-home stool-based testing offers a useful tool to supplement routine colonoscopy and reach a wider patient population,\u201d the authors write. \u201cNonetheless, it is important to emphasize that all positive SBTs must be followed by a timely colonoscopy to complete the screening paradigm.\u201d\n\nThe study was funded by the Exact Sciences Corporation.\n\nAbstract/Full Text\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 HealthDay.

            "text": "Most Hampton Roads colleges and universities have dropped the ACT and SAT as a requirement for admission. (Constantine Pankin/Shutterstock/Constantine Pankin // Shutterstock)\n\nPrincess Anne High School junior Victoria Lord said she never considered skipping the SAT.\n\nThe Virginia Beach student will take the test although she knows not all colleges she might apply to require it. To her, a good score shows her dedication to getting into a good school and could put her application over the top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI just feel like it\u2019s ... a standard part of education,\u201d Lord said. \u201cStandardized tests are always something that I feel like you kind of have to take and you have to deal with.\u201d\n\nThis is changing, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, more than 1,800 accredited four-year colleges and universities across the country are not requiring SAT and ACT scores for fall 2023 admissions. This is out of more than 2,200 recognized colleges and universities and an increase from approximately 800 test-optional schools in 2013. Most Hampton Roads higher education institutions have dropped the requirement, including the College of William & Mary, Old Dominion, Norfolk State, Christopher Newport, Hampton, Regent and Virginia Wesleyan universities.\n\nSo why take the tests if they aren\u2019t necessary?\n\nPrincess Anne High School senior Kerah Howeth said of the 13 universities she applied to, none required a test score. She took the SAT anyway, earning a 1330. She has been accepted to several schools and was offered scholarships. If she were to do it again, the future education major doesn\u2019t think she\u2019d take the SAT.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think it made that much of a difference,\u201d she said, adding that she did not believe the cost and time were worth it.\n\nAccording to the College Board website, the SAT costs $60, and the tests are generally offered on Saturdays. There are fee waivers for those who qualify. Schools can host SAT School Days to allow students to take the test during school hours. Portsmouth is participating and offering free testing to juniors who register by Friday.\n\nHoweth said several of her classmates were taking the test multiple times to improve scores. However, she thinks SATs and other standardized tests are \u201csuch a bad reflection of who you are as a student and as a person.\u201d\n\nVirginia Wesleyan made the shift to \u201ctest-optional\u201d when coronavirus restrictions affected access to the tests. Heather Campbell, the university\u2019s vice president for enrollment, said the decision was made to \u201ckeep our admission process fair and open to all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve continued with the test-optional practice because it\u2019s become clear that how students perform in day-to-day academic pursuits is a better determinant, versus a test, of their success at the college level,\u201d Campbell said in an email statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVirginia Beach Public Schools reported that participation rates in the tests decreased over the past five years. According to a presentation to the school board in December, 62% of graduates in 2017-18 took the SAT and 16% took the ACT. The percentages crept lower over the years. By 2021-22, 41% of graduates took the SAT and just 5% took the ACT; because of COVID, SAT participation that year was 31% and ACT was 4%.\n\nNewport News Public Schools reports a similar trend. In 2017, more than 980 graduating seniors took the SAT. The numbers dipped to 756 in 2020 and dropped to 303 in 2021. The division does not track ACT rates. A spokesperson noted that officials believe this decline is because fewer colleges and universities use the scores.\n\nChesapeake Public Schools had more than 1,800 graduating seniors who took the SAT in 2018. The rate remained steady until 2021, when it dropped to 676. The participation rate rebounded some in 2022 with nearly 1,300 seniors participating. Portsmouth and Norfolk Public Schools reported similar trends.\n\nStill, Virginia Beach officials encourage those who want to go to college to take at least one of the tests. Even if their top school choice doesn\u2019t require a score, it could still be beneficial depending on the program the students are interested in or for scholarship opportunities.\n\nLords said she understands why many students wouldn\u2019t take a standardized test, even if it is the right decision for her.\n\nThe shift for many schools to test-optional admissions is largely due to the pandemic, though Campbell said these tests have been called into question in more recent years. Standardized testing has been controversial for not being an equitable way to assess student intelligence. The test-optional model bases admission on a student\u2019s GPA and extracurriculars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCNU boasts on its website that it made its admissions test optional over a decade ago. Like Virginia Wesleyan, the goal is to focus on the student as a whole, rather than a test. The scores aren\u2019t used for admission but can be used for merit scholarship eligibility or when students are \u201csimply eager to share their accomplishments.\u201d\n\nHoweth has taken on leadership roles in band throughout high school from wind ensemble to leading a brass choir. That experience shows universities that she was well-rounded and better reflected who she was as a student.\n\n\u201cMy SAT score is one line on my application but my extracurriculars take up half a page,\u201d she said.\n\nKelsey Kendall, kelsey.kendall@virginiamedia.com",
